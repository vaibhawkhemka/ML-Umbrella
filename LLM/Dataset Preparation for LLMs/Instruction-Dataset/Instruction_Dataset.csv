fa7a8dc2-061f-44bd-8e79-9ba114b4cf4f,"The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Thursday requested that SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng be summoned to appear before the Communications Portfolio Committee for lying to Parliament about the SABC’s finances.  
“The problem for Motsoeneng is that lying to Parliament constitutes fraud and‚ as such‚ is a criminal offence‚” Gavin Davis‚ DA shadow minister of communications‚ said. 

The SABC annual report tabled in Parliament on Wednesday indicated that the SABC had suffered a R395-million loss in the 2014/15 financial year. 

“This contradicts Motsoeneng’s statement before the Communications Portfolio Committee on 22 April 2015. He said‚ ‘The SABC‚ financially‚ we are sustainable.’ 

“(Communications) Minister (Faith) Muthambi agreed. ‘The SABC is on a sound financial footing‚’ the minister of communications told the committee. 

“Significantly‚ neither Muthambi nor Motsoeneng mentioned the SABC’s projected loss for this financial year. This was despite the existence of internal SABC financial documents dated March 2015 (later exposed by the Sunday Times) that indicated the SABC was due to make a massive loss. 

“The loss of R395-million in the 2014/15 financial year‚ compares with the R358-million the SABC recorded as profit in the previous financial year. 

“This means that‚ under Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s watch‚ the SABC’s finances have taken a R753-million nose-dive. 

“Yet‚ in the same period‚ Motsoeneng received a R916‚000 pay rise to R3.7-million. No wonder Motsoeneng was so keen to paint a rosy picture of the SABC’s finances before Parliament – he needed to lie to justify his multi-million rand pay cheque‚” Davis said. 

“The problem for Motsoeneng is that lying to Parliament constitutes fraud and‚ as such‚ is a criminal offence. 

“According to Section 17 of the Powers‚ Privileges and Immunities of Parliaments and Provincial Legislatures Act of 2004: ‘A person who willfully furnishes a House or committee with information‚ or makes a statement before it‚ which is false or misleading‚ commits an offence and is liable to a fine or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years…’ 

“I have today (Thursday) written to the chairperson of the Communications Portfolio Committee‚ Joyce Moloi-Moropa‚ to request that Hlaudi Motsoeneng be summoned to account for misleading Parliament. 

“In the meantime‚ I have also written to the Public Protector to request an investigation into Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s salary increase‚ as revealed in the SABC’s annual report yesterday. 

“The fact is that Hlaudi Motsoeneng is being handsomely rewarded while the SABC lurches from one crisis to the next. 

“Motsoeneng must be held to account for his exorbitant salary increases‚ the SABC’s financial losses under his watch‚ and the lies that he has told in Parliament‚” Davis said.",'Motsoeneng must account for lying to Parliament',News,Sowetan,2015-09-25T05:10:12Z,POLITICS

PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea -- Vulnerable Pacific island nations will this week send the world an urgent plea for action on climate change at crunch talks in Paris later this year.

Some Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) countries lie barely a meter above sea level and fear they will disappear beneath the waves without drastic intervention from major polluters.

The 15-nation regional grouping, meeting in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea from Monday, has long complained of bearing the brunt of climate change, even though its members make a miniscule contribution to global carbon emissions.

For more than a decade, the annual PIF summit has heard details of eroding coastlines, increasingly destructive storms and crops ruined by encroaching seawater.

Villagers in the Marshall Islands have seen graveyards swamped, while tiny Kiribati has purchased a large block of land in Fiji in case its entire population needs to relocate.

Palau President Tommy Remengesau said the Pacific's plight should prick the conscience of delegates from 195 nations who will meet in Paris in December seeking a breakthrough climate deal.

“What is happening is non-uniform, rapid, extreme and destructive in impact and consequences,” said Remengesau, who is also the PIF president.

“There is immediate danger for all small island countries. Climate change is causing serious damage now, it is not an event of the future,” he told AFP.

The so-called COP21 talks in Paris will seek a binding deal to take effect in 2020 that will commit all nations to emissions cuts.

The goal is to limit average global warming to 2 degrees Celsius over pre-Industrial Revolution levels.

'Unviable very soon' 

Former New Zealand prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said the Paris talks could determine the future of Pacific territories such as Kiribati, Tuvalu and Tokelau.

“If you get a meter of inundation by the tides then some of those countries are going to become unviable very soon,” he told a climate discussion in Wellington organized by the French embassy.

“You're looking there at the destruction of a culture. This is terrible and we're not doing anything about it.”

Australia and New Zealand, the two largest PIF members, have been accused of dragging their feet on climate change, but Kiribati President Anote Tong said small island nations would not allow them to water down the PIF's call for action.

“I don't know what problems these countries have ... but we'll have a very big problem if we don't have strong language,” he said. “We need action as soon as possible.”

Another issue set for discussion at the PIF meeting is a clampdown on civil rights in Nauru which prompted New Zealand on Wednesday to suspend foreign aid to the country's justice sector.

The U.N. and United States have called for restoration of basic freedoms in Nauru, saying they are fundamental to democracy, and New Zealand has said it will air its concerns in Port Moresby.

The Pacific's multi-billion-U.S.-dollar tuna industry will also be under scrutiny. It is an economic lifeline for some nations but vulnerable to poaching and overfishing.

The talks are also set to touch on regional integration, potentially allowing French Polynesia in as a full member, and curbing an obesity epidemic in the Pacific. – 2015 The China Post.

WWP Alumnus Brett Miller Helps Wounded Veterans Through Outdoor Excursions JACKSONVILLE, Fla. 

Miller, a U.S. Army veteran, founded Warfighter Outfitters, Inc. in 2013 as a nonprofit organization for wounded and disabled combat veterans. His organization's philosophy emphasizes veterans helping veterans through free fishing and outdoor hunting excursions. Miller, who is also a WWP peer mentor, serves veterans in a remote area. 

Since 2012, WWP Program Grants has held two annual grant cycles to support the increasing number of returning wounded veterans and their reintegration needs. Miller, whose 2005 deployment to Iraq 

""Once I was discharged, I began my passions of hunting and fishing, started inviting other vet buddies along and noticed the healing factor of these trips,"" Miller said. ""The demand for the trips grew and grew and eventually became very costly. So after years of paying out of pocket, I started the nonprofit Warfighter Outfitters, Inc."" 

Miller says he is proud of his full-time commitment to getting injured veterans outside and engaged. ""There is a very casual atmosphere that allows an open forum to discuss the issues at hand,"" said Miller. Warfighter Outfitters provides participating injured veterans with adaptive vehicles that allow everyone – despite ability level – to engage in the hunting activities that are so popular in the Northwest. 

The Warfighter Outfitters, Inc. board of directors is comprised exclusively of veterans and employs volunteer staff. All contributions to the organization go to its programs. ""Warfighter Outfitters is successful mainly due to a large part of the west coast that is essentially barren of activities,"" said Miller. ""Veterans in the Pacific Northwest really enjoy the trips we provide; they are very popular with Alumni. We even had guys travel from states way out of the region to go on our events."" 

WWP invests in organizations that focus on enriching the lives of injured veterans through an array of programs that seek to improve mental health and wellness; expose wounded service members to new opportunities for physical fitness and activity; connect wounded service members with their peers and communities; and enhance economic empowerment and independence.

Pöyry awarded structural engineering assignment for Mikkeli Central Hospital, Finland 
    
Southern Savonia Hospital District has awarded Pöyry with a structural engineering assignment relating to a renovation and expansion project at Mikkeli Central Hospital. The assignment covers the structural engineering of the changes to the existing hospital and its expansion. 
 
The goal of Mikkeli's project is to combine the city's social, basic and specialist healthcare services into one unit on the current hospital campus. It is intended to provide better, more cost-effective service to all of the municipalities and residents of the hospital district. 
 
The project will expand the current hospital. Additional floors will be constructed as well as a new, five-storey family ward-type building. Existing facilities will be rearranged and renovated while the hospital remains active - a key consideration in both the design and construction phases. 
 
The project will consolidate the facilities of the hospital district and Mikkeli's social and health services by approximately 20%. The centralising improves and enhances the services provided to the residents while enabling savings. 
 
""Pöyry has extensive experience of structural engineering in large hospital projects. This experience will be useful, especially considering the requirements for the hospital to remain active whilst the work takes place,"" says Pekka Narinen, Director, Pöyry's Civil Engineering unit. 
 
The project began in July and will be completed in 2020.

 Bank finances Doğuş Çay’s far-reaching investment programme 
 

	The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is continuing to support the agribusiness sector in Turkey with a €50 million loan to local tea and snacks producer, Doğuş Çay. 
 

	The Bank will finance the company’s far-reaching investment programme for 2015 and 2016 which includes construction of a new iced tea production line in Izmir, an upgrade of warehouses and potato chip production facilities in Aksaray, as well as the refinancing of existing short and mid-term loans. 
 

	The EBRD will also help the company further improve its corporate governance and resource efficiency to make it more competitive in local and regional markets. 
 

	Gilles Mettetal, Director for Agribusiness at the EBRD, said: “With our financing we are helping this successful Turkish company to increase sales by launching new tea production lines and improve its potato chips business through investments in warehouses while advancing its corporate governance, efficiency and environmental standards.” 
 

	Founded in the early 1980s by brothers Alpaslan and Suleyman Karakan, Doğuş Çay started as a small tea trading company in Rize, in the eastern Black Sea region of Turkey, where tea farming remains a main economic driver. By the 1990s the brothers had transformed the enterprise from trading to processing and packaging, later diversifying into sugar packaging and the production of tomato paste and potato chips. 
 

	Doğuş Çay is currently one of the top three tea producers in Turkey, with a 13 per cent market share. It has a 17.5 per cent market share in the chips and snacks segment.   
 

	Enhancing the competitiveness of Turkish companies through innovation, better corporate governance and greater resource efficiency is a priority for the EBRD in Turkey where the Bank started investing in 2009. 
 

	It currently operates from offices in Istanbul, Ankara and Gaziantep. In 2014 Turkey became the leading recipient country of the EBRD, with new investments worth €1.4 billion. 
 

	To date, the EBRD has invested over €6 billion in Turkey through close to 160 projects in infrastructure, energy, agribusiness, industry and finance. The Bank has also mobilised over €12 billion for these ventures from other sources of financing.
