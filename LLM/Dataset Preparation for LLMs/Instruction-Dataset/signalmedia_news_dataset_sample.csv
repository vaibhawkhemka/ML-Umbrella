fa7a8dc2-061f-44bd-8e79-9ba114b4cf4f,"The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Thursday requested that SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng be summoned to appear before the Communications Portfolio Committee for lying to Parliament about the SABC’s finances.  
“The problem for Motsoeneng is that lying to Parliament constitutes fraud and‚ as such‚ is a criminal offence‚” Gavin Davis‚ DA shadow minister of communications‚ said. 

The SABC annual report tabled in Parliament on Wednesday indicated that the SABC had suffered a R395-million loss in the 2014/15 financial year. 

“This contradicts Motsoeneng’s statement before the Communications Portfolio Committee on 22 April 2015. He said‚ ‘The SABC‚ financially‚ we are sustainable.’ 

“(Communications) Minister (Faith) Muthambi agreed. ‘The SABC is on a sound financial footing‚’ the minister of communications told the committee. 

“Significantly‚ neither Muthambi nor Motsoeneng mentioned the SABC’s projected loss for this financial year. This was despite the existence of internal SABC financial documents dated March 2015 (later exposed by the Sunday Times) that indicated the SABC was due to make a massive loss. 

“The loss of R395-million in the 2014/15 financial year‚ compares with the R358-million the SABC recorded as profit in the previous financial year. 

“This means that‚ under Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s watch‚ the SABC’s finances have taken a R753-million nose-dive. 

“Yet‚ in the same period‚ Motsoeneng received a R916‚000 pay rise to R3.7-million. No wonder Motsoeneng was so keen to paint a rosy picture of the SABC’s finances before Parliament – he needed to lie to justify his multi-million rand pay cheque‚” Davis said. 

“The problem for Motsoeneng is that lying to Parliament constitutes fraud and‚ as such‚ is a criminal offence. 

“According to Section 17 of the Powers‚ Privileges and Immunities of Parliaments and Provincial Legislatures Act of 2004: ‘A person who willfully furnishes a House or committee with information‚ or makes a statement before it‚ which is false or misleading‚ commits an offence and is liable to a fine or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years…’ 

“I have today (Thursday) written to the chairperson of the Communications Portfolio Committee‚ Joyce Moloi-Moropa‚ to request that Hlaudi Motsoeneng be summoned to account for misleading Parliament. 

“In the meantime‚ I have also written to the Public Protector to request an investigation into Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s salary increase‚ as revealed in the SABC’s annual report yesterday. 

“The fact is that Hlaudi Motsoeneng is being handsomely rewarded while the SABC lurches from one crisis to the next. 

“Motsoeneng must be held to account for his exorbitant salary increases‚ the SABC’s financial losses under his watch‚ and the lies that he has told in Parliament‚” Davis said.",'Motsoeneng must account for lying to Parliament',News,Sowetan,2015-09-25T05:10:12Z

PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea -- Vulnerable Pacific island nations will this week send the world an urgent plea for action on climate change at crunch talks in Paris later this year.

Some Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) countries lie barely a meter above sea level and fear they will disappear beneath the waves without drastic intervention from major polluters.

The 15-nation regional grouping, meeting in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea from Monday, has long complained of bearing the brunt of climate change, even though its members make a miniscule contribution to global carbon emissions.

For more than a decade, the annual PIF summit has heard details of eroding coastlines, increasingly destructive storms and crops ruined by encroaching seawater.

Villagers in the Marshall Islands have seen graveyards swamped, while tiny Kiribati has purchased a large block of land in Fiji in case its entire population needs to relocate.

Palau President Tommy Remengesau said the Pacific's plight should prick the conscience of delegates from 195 nations who will meet in Paris in December seeking a breakthrough climate deal.

“What is happening is non-uniform, rapid, extreme and destructive in impact and consequences,” said Remengesau, who is also the PIF president.

“There is immediate danger for all small island countries. Climate change is causing serious damage now, it is not an event of the future,” he told AFP.

The so-called COP21 talks in Paris will seek a binding deal to take effect in 2020 that will commit all nations to emissions cuts.

The goal is to limit average global warming to 2 degrees Celsius over pre-Industrial Revolution levels.

'Unviable very soon' 

Former New Zealand prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said the Paris talks could determine the future of Pacific territories such as Kiribati, Tuvalu and Tokelau.

“If you get a meter of inundation by the tides then some of those countries are going to become unviable very soon,” he told a climate discussion in Wellington organized by the French embassy.

“You're looking there at the destruction of a culture. This is terrible and we're not doing anything about it.”

Australia and New Zealand, the two largest PIF members, have been accused of dragging their feet on climate change, but Kiribati President Anote Tong said small island nations would not allow them to water down the PIF's call for action.

“I don't know what problems these countries have ... but we'll have a very big problem if we don't have strong language,” he said. “We need action as soon as possible.”

Another issue set for discussion at the PIF meeting is a clampdown on civil rights in Nauru which prompted New Zealand on Wednesday to suspend foreign aid to the country's justice sector.

The U.N. and United States have called for restoration of basic freedoms in Nauru, saying they are fundamental to democracy, and New Zealand has said it will air its concerns in Port Moresby.

The Pacific's multi-billion-U.S.-dollar tuna industry will also be under scrutiny. It is an economic lifeline for some nations but vulnerable to poaching and overfishing.

The talks are also set to touch on regional integration, potentially allowing French Polynesia in as a full member, and curbing an obesity epidemic in the Pacific. – 2015 The China Post. Back to Story",Pacific summit to issue climate message to world,News,China Post,2015-09-06T16:37:27Z

WWP Alumnus Brett Miller Helps Wounded Veterans Through Outdoor Excursions JACKSONVILLE, Fla. 

Miller, a U.S. Army veteran, founded Warfighter Outfitters, Inc. in 2013 as a nonprofit organization for wounded and disabled combat veterans. His organization's philosophy emphasizes veterans helping veterans through free fishing and outdoor hunting excursions. Miller, who is also a WWP peer mentor, serves veterans in a remote area. 

Since 2012, WWP Program Grants has held two annual grant cycles to support the increasing number of returning wounded veterans and their reintegration needs. Miller, whose 2005 deployment to Iraq 

""Once I was discharged, I began my passions of hunting and fishing, started inviting other vet buddies along and noticed the healing factor of these trips,"" Miller said. ""The demand for the trips grew and grew and eventually became very costly. So after years of paying out of pocket, I started the nonprofit Warfighter Outfitters, Inc."" 

Miller says he is proud of his full-time commitment to getting injured veterans outside and engaged. ""There is a very casual atmosphere that allows an open forum to discuss the issues at hand,"" said Miller. Warfighter Outfitters provides participating injured veterans with adaptive vehicles that allow everyone – despite ability level – to engage in the hunting activities that are so popular in the Northwest. 

The Warfighter Outfitters, Inc. board of directors is comprised exclusively of veterans and employs volunteer staff. All contributions to the organization go to its programs. ""Warfighter Outfitters is successful mainly due to a large part of the west coast that is essentially barren of activities,"" said Miller. ""Veterans in the Pacific Northwest really enjoy the trips we provide; they are very popular with Alumni. We even had guys travel from states way out of the region to go on our events."" 

WWP invests in organizations that focus on enriching the lives of injured veterans through an array of programs that seek to improve mental health and wellness; expose wounded service members to new opportunities for physical fitness and activity; connect wounded service members with their peers and communities; and enhance economic empowerment and independence.

Pöyry awarded structural engineering assignment for Mikkeli Central Hospital, Finland 
    
Southern Savonia Hospital District has awarded Pöyry with a structural engineering assignment relating to a renovation and expansion project at Mikkeli Central Hospital. The assignment covers the structural engineering of the changes to the existing hospital and its expansion. 
 
The goal of Mikkeli's project is to combine the city's social, basic and specialist healthcare services into one unit on the current hospital campus. It is intended to provide better, more cost-effective service to all of the municipalities and residents of the hospital district. 
 
The project will expand the current hospital. Additional floors will be constructed as well as a new, five-storey family ward-type building. Existing facilities will be rearranged and renovated while the hospital remains active - a key consideration in both the design and construction phases. 
 
The project will consolidate the facilities of the hospital district and Mikkeli's social and health services by approximately 20%. The centralising improves and enhances the services provided to the residents while enabling savings. 
 
""Pöyry has extensive experience of structural engineering in large hospital projects. This experience will be useful, especially considering the requirements for the hospital to remain active whilst the work takes place,"" says Pekka Narinen, Director, Pöyry's Civil Engineering unit. 
 
The project began in July and will be completed in 2020.

 Bank finances Doğuş Çay’s far-reaching investment programme 
 

	The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is continuing to support the agribusiness sector in Turkey with a €50 million loan to local tea and snacks producer, Doğuş Çay. 
 

	The Bank will finance the company’s far-reaching investment programme for 2015 and 2016 which includes construction of a new iced tea production line in Izmir, an upgrade of warehouses and potato chip production facilities in Aksaray, as well as the refinancing of existing short and mid-term loans. 
 

	The EBRD will also help the company further improve its corporate governance and resource efficiency to make it more competitive in local and regional markets. 
 

	Gilles Mettetal, Director for Agribusiness at the EBRD, said: “With our financing we are helping this successful Turkish company to increase sales by launching new tea production lines and improve its potato chips business through investments in warehouses while advancing its corporate governance, efficiency and environmental standards.” 
 

	Founded in the early 1980s by brothers Alpaslan and Suleyman Karakan, Doğuş Çay started as a small tea trading company in Rize, in the eastern Black Sea region of Turkey, where tea farming remains a main economic driver. By the 1990s the brothers had transformed the enterprise from trading to processing and packaging, later diversifying into sugar packaging and the production of tomato paste and potato chips. 
 

	Doğuş Çay is currently one of the top three tea producers in Turkey, with a 13 per cent market share. It has a 17.5 per cent market share in the chips and snacks segment.   
 

	Enhancing the competitiveness of Turkish companies through innovation, better corporate governance and greater resource efficiency is a priority for the EBRD in Turkey where the Bank started investing in 2009. 
 

	It currently operates from offices in Istanbul, Ankara and Gaziantep. In 2014 Turkey became the leading recipient country of the EBRD, with new investments worth €1.4 billion. 
 

	To date, the EBRD has invested over €6 billion in Turkey through close to 160 projects in infrastructure, energy, agribusiness, industry and finance. The Bank has also mobilised over €12 billion for these ventures from other sources of financing.

9db2e451-598f-4bb8-8ab0-5809707b375b,"Janet Yellen, 69, was giving a speech at the University of Massachusetts During her speech she became confused and started coughing a lot Yellen is currently the head of the world's most powerful central bank Any questions about her own health could unsettle financial markets A Fed spokesman said she was just 'dehydrated' during the long speech     The Federal Reserve announced that interest rates were left unchanged But the U.S. central bank 'is on track to raise interest rates this year'  
Federal Reserve Chair
Janet Yellen received medical attention on Thursday after
coughing, pausing and struggling to finish a speech. 

Yellen, 69, was giving a speech at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in which she
said the U.S. central bank was on track to raise interest rates
this year for the first time in nearly a decade. 

Nearing the end of her speech, she began to slow and then lost her place in reading her notes, before pausing for 20 seconds, beginning again and then taking another 25-second break.  

The audience sat in silence as she coughed and appeared slightly flushed before awkwardly concluding and abruptly saying: 'Let me stop there.'  
  
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen coughs and takes a long pause at the end of her speech on inflation, she later received medical attention after struggling to finish a speech 
   
The audience sat in silence as Yellen coughed and appeared slightly flushed before awkwardly concluding and abruptly saying: 'Let me stop there' 

As head of the world's most powerful central bank, Yellen
plays a major role in the global economy and has been at the
center of speculation over when the Fed would finally raise
rates. 

Rates have been at near zero for almost seven years now, so a change would reverberate through financial markets worldwide. 

The frightening few moments, in which Yellen appeared to
lose her concentration a few times in a speech  came in her first public comments a
week after she explained the Fed's decision to delay the
much-anticipated policy tightening. 
 
But Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith told Reuters: 'Chair Yellen felt dehydrated at the end of a long speech
under bright lights.' 

'As a precaution, she was seen by (emergency medical)
staff on site at UMass Amherst. She felt fine afterwards and has
continued with her schedule Thursday evening.' 

A university spokesman said she was attending a dinner event
as planned. 
  
A Fed spokesman said: 'Chair Yellen, pictured, felt dehydrated at the end of a long speech under bright lights' 

For Yellen it had been a long day at the university that
started with a breakfast with graduate students and faculty,
according to three people who were there. 

She had been speaking for nearly an hour before a packed university auditorium here, but appeared to lose her place in reading the last few lines of her speech on inflation.  

As she struggled, two people rushed from the audience to the
stage door to help her.  

Michael Ash, chairman of the school's
economics department, quickly joined Yellen on stage,
whispering: 'Are you ok?' He gave her a plaque and followed her
off stage, with Yellen smiling faintly and walking slowly but
without assistance. 

As people departed the auditorium, one was heard saying,
'That was scary.' 

Minutes later, two medical workers standing near the
backstage doors said they attended to the Fed chair. One of the
workers was carrying oxygen equipment. 
   
A trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange  works underneath a television screen showing Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen announcing that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged 
  
Any questions about Yellen's own health could unsettle financial markets that have been skittish about the health of the global economy and the impact of a Fed rate hike, which could rock bond markets and suck capital from emerging markets 

The Fed declined to comment on whether Yellen, who has not
been known to suffer from any health problems, intended to seek
a medical check-up. 

Any questions about Yellen's own health could unsettle
financial markets that have been skittish about the health of
the global economy and the impact of a Fed rate hike, which
could rock bond markets and suck capital from emerging markets. 

In her speech, Yellen said she expects to begin tightening
policy later this year as long as inflation remains stable and
the U.S. economy is strong enough to boost employment. 

Recent global economic and financial market developments do
not significantly affect the U.S. central bank's policy, she
said. 

That message, along with Yellen's contention that recent
inflationary weakness is likely transitory, may come as a
surprise to some investors who took last week's policy decision
by the Fed as a sign that a U.S. policy tightening was no longer
imminent and would likely come next year. 

Much of the recent price weakness, Yellen said, is due to
special factors such as a strong dollar and low oil prices,
which are likely to fade, allowing U.S. inflation to rise to a 2
percent goal over the next few years. 
 
A trader working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange listens to Yellen explains why the Federal Reserve chose not raise interest rates on September 17. The Fed's decision to hold off raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade was somewhat expected. 

Yellen said that both she and the policy-making Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) expect the world's largest economy to be
strong enough to achieve maximum employment and to keep
expectations for prices stable. 

'Most FOMC participants, including myself, currently
anticipate that achieving these conditions will likely entail an
initial increase in the federal funds rate later this year,
followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter,' Yellen
told hundreds of students and local residents at the University
of Massachusetts, Amherst. 

As it stands, she said, U.S. economic prospects 'generally
appear solid.' 

The Fed's decision to hold off raising rates for the first
time in nearly a decade was somewhat expected, given a recent
selloff in global financial markets that was sparked by fears
that China's economy is weaker than expected. 

But economists and investors reacted to Yellen's cautious
tone last week by complaining of mixed messages and pushing
expectations of a rate hike out to March of next year, from
December previously, based on futures markets. 

Yellen, however, said it was best not to delay 'too long'
what should be a 'quite gradual' pace of future rate hikes. 'The
more prudent strategy is to begin tightening in a timely fashion
and at a gradual pace, adjusting policy as needed in light of
incoming data,' she said on Thursday. 

Before the speech several people said they had spent time
with Yellen during the busy day in this college town.  

At the
breakfast, Yellen spent a lot of time discussing how the Fed
works and answered some questions, according to those who were
there. 

In 2004, at age 57, she ran the Avenue of the Giants half
marathon, in the redwood forests of Northern California. 
 YELLEN CAUTIONS THAT INFLATION WILL DETERMINE POLICY SHIFTS    
Yellen cautioned that inflation may rise more slowly or
rapidly than anticipated, which would prompt policy adjustments. 
   
But she warned that letting inflation rise too much could
lead the Fed to tighten so forcefully it could roil financial
markets 'and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into
recession.' 

The Fed has two more chances to tighten this year, with policy meetings set for October and December.  

She also hinted at what would give the Fed assurance that
inflation would return to target, clearing the way to a rate
hike. 

'We need,' she said, 'to be reasonably confident that we
will see continued solid economic growth and further gains in
resource utilization, with longer-term inflation expectations
remaining near their pre-recession level. 

The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal
consumption expenditures price index, should rise to 1.5 percent
or higher next year, from 1.2 percent now, 'barring a further
substantial drop in crude oil prices and provided that the
dollar does not appreciate noticeably further,' she said. 

She even floated the benefits of pushing unemployment, 
below its long-run level of about 4.9 percent for a time, saying
that would help drive inflation higher, draw discouraged workers
back into the workforce and improve Americans' living standards. ",Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen receives medical attention at the University of Massachusetts,News,Mail Online UK,2015-09-25T01:47:36Z

Spain is not only a popular tourist destination; the country is also becoming a successful incubator of high-tech start-ups, with Mundo Reader SL (BQ) and other local companies competing against global companies. 
 The rise of local start-ups  
Between 2009 and 2013, the Spanish economy experienced a general decline in all industries and segments. In 2013, unemployment stood at 26%. And yet, despite this situation, Spaniards found the motivation to materialise their ideas and start their own businesses, such as BQ. These business models are very far from the traditional strong points of the Spanish economy and it seems that Spain has room for technology companies that are able to compete against the likes of Samsung and Apple. 
 
In 2015, the Spanish consumer electronics market benefited from government initiatives, such as the Center for Industrial Technological Development (CDTI). This public corporation under the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness promotes innovation and the technological development of Spanish companies. It addresses funding applications and supports the research, development and innovation of Spanish companies at both national and international level. In this environment, a number of companies have thrived, and it is now possible to find in Spain companies like BQ, the trademark behind Mundo Reader SL, which began as a small start-up, created by a group of university students. BQ started with USB drives, before expanding its product portfolio to include e-readers, whilst always maintaining a more personalised, post-sales, service-orientated strategy, and moving into the fast-growing smartphones category in 2013. A personalised, post-sales service was possible because BQ’s smartphones were sold directly to the consumer rather than through a mobile operator, which competitors used to do. This enables the consumer to obtain a phone at a better deal than directly from a retailer where Apple and Samsung smartphones are sold at much higher prices. This strategy enabled BQ’s product portfolio to expand to include e-readers, tablets, smartphones and 3D printers. 
  Rapid increase in market volume share  
BQ is the leader in e-readers in Spain, with a 30% volume share , and the third-leading player in both tablets ( 12% ) and smartphones ( 13% ). In smartphones, a BQ Aquaris E5 smartphone retails for €189, whereas a Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo retails for €429, both with similar technical specifications. Beyond low prices, BQ’s competitive strategy includes a good after-sales service and a patriotic sentiment amongst Spaniards (encouraging them to support local brands), which propelled the company into third place in the overall consumer electronics market in 2015, only slightly behind Samsung and Sony. The company has gained significant market share in just three years, as it was ranked 12th in 2013 with only a 1% market volume share compared to a 7% volume share in 2015. 
 
Alongside Mundo Reader SL (BQ), there are other successful consumer electronics companies engendered and created in Spain. Energy Sistem Soyntec SA and Quatrotec Electrónica SL (Woxter) are also excellent examples of Spanish start-ups that manage to engage with their consumers. They perceive both companies’ successes as their own personal achievements, while also contributing to the local economy by buying Spanish products. 
 Expansion  
The organisational structures of these companies are smaller than those of bigger global companies like Apple , Samsung and LG , which, combined with outsourced manufacturing and simpler cost structures, enables them to reduce production costs and offer solutions at more competitive prices. This model can be replicated and developed for smaller companies which are willing to compete against bigger players with higher cost structures and slower supply chains. Not content with just being a local player, BQ has expanded into Portugal, Germany and France, replicating its success formula to other countries in Western Europe. 
 
When it comes to technology products, it is the norm to think that consumers will choose global companies like Samsung as they have bigger marketing budgets and stronger brand recognition. However, start-ups like BQ can compete against these giants by focusing on competitive pricing and appealing to consumers’ desire to support local starts-ups and, in turn, stimulate the local economy. Nevertheless, continued government support will be necessary to encourage technological creativity and provide local start-ups with economic backing to develop as long-term sustainable economic models.

2f4c2637-f2c3-48a2-9050-708c2da06daa,"ATLANTA , Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The board of directors of Cumulus Media Inc. [NASDAQ: CMLS] today announced that Mary G.

Radio is a powerful and unique medium  the number one mass reach medium in the U.S.  and Cumulus possesses all of the elements to be one of the industry's winners. I look forward to bringing a renewed focus on operating excellence at all levels and in all functions to help Cumulus realize its potential and generate improved financial performance and increased value for shareholders."" 
 
Lew Dickey , President and Chief Executive Officer of Cumulus said, ""When I founded Cumulus in 1997, my goal was to create the nationwide platform we have today, with 460 stations in 90 cities, the industry's most important network, and unique original content, such as NASH.

2259ef4f-4bd9-4cbd-afb3-4352acbda748,"(StatePoint) Maintaining strong grades in every subject can be tough on even the brightest of the bunch. This is especially true these days, as students routinely are taking on more extracurricular activities and part-time jobs while enrolled in school. 
  
Students looking to grasp complicated class material -- and still have time left at the end of the day -- can stand to benefit from tried-and-true systems for learning, say experts. 
 
“Every student from a young age should learn speed reading, speed math and mnemonics,” says Harry Edelson, venture capitalist, managing director of Edelson Technology Partners and author of the new book, “ Positivity: How to be Happier, Healthier, Smarter, and More Prosperous .” 
 
Edelson, the son of an illiterate Russian immigrant, attributes his triumph over childhood poverty and success in the classroom and business world, to the adoption of key mental tricks and a positive attitude. In “Positivity,” he delves into how others may follow suit. Here he shares a few insights. 
 
Speed Reading 
 
Speed reading allows a reader to take in written material much more quickly than traditional reading. While those wishing to improve their speed reading skills once had to attend seminars or enroll in a course, now lessons are widely offered online. Free software, as well as apps available for download to your phone, can offer training in this useful art. 
 
Speed Math 
 
Like speed reading, speed math can help students finish their homework faster and with more precision. Additionally, learning this skill offers students a deeper understanding of mathematical operations. A range of books on the subject, as well as online tutorials, can supplement classroom learning. 
 
Mnemonics 
 
So much of school testing involves the need for recall and recitation, especially as schools nationwide adopt Common Core Standards. Mnemonics are a classic and effective method of memorization and information retention. Depending on the material, students can turn to existing mnemonic devices or create their own. 
 
Positive Thinking 
 
“I consider myself to be very lucky. I have been happy all my life even though I started out as poor as a child could be,” says Edelson, who says positivity can lend itself to success. “Take control of your senses, determine to be happy and develop a frame of mind that will make you and all those around you happy.” 
 
For an edge this semester, don’t reinvent the wheel. Consider first the academic techniques and personal philosophies that have worked so well for others.

82f578ff-251b-41e9-86cf-8b9f383f184c,"The very things that make him a crowd pleaser must be balanced against the imperative to turn himself from the brilliant individualist into a consensus politician. 

Just after lunch on Tuesday the Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove, the first man to be knighted by Tony Abbott, invited the Prime Minister-elect to take the oath of office.

Turnbull's words filled Yarralumla's drawing room when suddenly his only grandson, toddler Jack Turnbull-Brown, started gurgling the tune from the ABC TV children's show Peg + Cat.

An unfortunate choice perhaps, given the elderly and urban mythic claim that Turnbull once killed a former girlfriend's cat but nothing was ever going to stop this republican dead cat bounce.

""I Malcolm Bligh Turnbull do swear that I will well and truly serve the people of Australia in the office of Prime Minister and that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to her majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the Queen of Australia, so help me God.""

It's been a banner week for political leaders who stand for one thing but believe something else.

Britain's new Labour leader, the staunchly anti-monarchist Jeremy Corbyn​, came under withering fire for standing in silence while God Save the Queen was played during a Battle of Britain remembrance ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral.

But Turnbull's dexterity in fusing monarchist and republican values passed mostly unremarked.

It was another day in Turnbull's inexorable cavalcade of achievement and who would dare rain on the parade, especially as he had just started his political honeymoon?

Right now between 61.9 and 70 per cent of Australians see Turnbull as the preferred prime minister to Labor's Bill Shorten, according to diverse opinion polls.

He is every Labor supporter's favourite Liberal, but not that popular among parliamentary colleagues and only a handful of votes away from oblivion.

Australians watched with fear, loathing, sadness or joy as Abbott spent the year engineering his own self-destruction, but after nine months of madness Turnbull only got his job by 54 votes to 44, after arguing he was a superior communicator and better salesman.

Turnbull may be the darling of middle Australia, the Q&A crowd, the big end of town and embody the victory of elites over populism, but his prime ministership remains a slim creation of MPs disinterested in their man and concerned solely with retaining government or their seats.

The right of the Liberal Party has him locked in on all the contentious issues.

Essentially Turnbull is to sell the same product. The satirists John Clarke and Bryan Dawe caught the zeitgeist perfectly on their weekly segment, calling Turnbull's arrival, ""A seamless transition in our sales division"".

However, the very things that make Turnbull a crowd pleaser – his charm, his stark counterpoint to Abbott and the party ideologues – must be balanced against the imperative to turn himself from the brilliant individualist into a consensus politician.

The question is: can Turnbull stop being Turnbull?

Many are already wondering whether any material changes to government policy will eventuate, when they might occur, or if they will occur at all.

To date, Turnbull PM appears committed to backing the party line.

He has flagged there will be no changes to the same-sex marriage policies which could see gay unions kept on hold for at least two years. Ditto climate change with the emissions target remaining both futile and an international joke. Turnbull's decision to return water policy to the thirsty National Party is construed as the price of admission to The Lodge. Similarly locked in are $100,000 university degrees, the moneyless month for young dole seekers, cuts to funding for domestic violence services, cuts to the ABC, and the continuation of the MH370 search. However a major reversal of plans to send submarine building contracts overseas appears to be in the wind with Abbott acolyte Kevin Andrews backing the move and trailing his coat to retain the Defence Minister post. Christopher Pyne is mentioned in dispatches for the defence job to help retain his Adelaide-based seat.

University of Melbourne political scientist Associate Professor Sally Young wonders whether Turnbull can juggle the expectations of swinging and progressive voters attracted to his small ""l"" Liberal stand and his conservative party colleagues, some of whom backed him as the best chance at the next election.

""Opinion polls are trickling through showing that people really like him,"" she says. ""There are big expectations and with big expectations come big problems. We saw that with Rudd, we saw that with Blair, we saw that with Obama. The more popular you are, the more people expect things from you... and you often disappoint them.""

Young thinks the leaking to Fairfax Media of a sensitive cabinet document showing Turnbull was the Abbott government's worst-performing minister in appointing women to boards was emblematic of the problems the newly-minted Prime Minister faces from within.

""Mr Turnbull has to placate not only conservatives within his own party, the Nationals, and the conservative media – which hasn't been very supportive in him taking over from Mr Abbott – so there's really a lot in the mix,"" she says.

""It is very likely that he'll disappoint people because that's what political leaders tend to do. The challenge is to take the middle ground. That is what wins and loses in Australian politics. Rudd took it. So too did Abbott, but they both drifted.""

Not unexpectedly, business, both big and small, welcomed Turnbull's arrival, especially as he said Australia needed a style of economic leadership ""that respects the people's intelligence; that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it"".

Tax reform, an overhaul of superannuation and a shake-up of industrial relations are at the top of the business community's wishlist.

""Reform is daunting for politicians but I think they've got the right idea. What they've been missing is the rhetoric so they can sell these ideas to the Australian people,"" former BHP Billiton chairman Don Argus told journalists. ""It's a huge challenge for whoever gets in. The debt levels at a national and at a state level are too high. Consumer debt is too high. We need a government that creates jobs. Can Malcolm do it? I don't know. Tony didn't.""

Just as the rise and rise of Bob Hawke was a national soap opera, Turnbull's fortunate life has been conducted under the klieg lights.

Everybody in Sydney seems to know a Turnbull story. Famously non sequitur, his ability to chop and change or represent disparate positions is both his charm and Achilles heel.

He has changed religions; a feminist, he negotiated Kerry Packer's deal with Hugh Hefner to publish an Australian edition of Playboy magazine in 1978; no sooner had he vanquished Abbott, than Labor stalwarts scurried to claim the man who was once nearly theirs.

Former Labor NSW general secretary John Della Bosca recalled discussing Labor preselection with the ageing tyro when the pair were involved in the Australian Republican Movement in the 1990s. Former NSW premier Bob Carr, who shared bylines with Turnbull on Packer's Bulletin magazine, thought he was a Liberal but remembered hearing he aspired to the job of federal secretary of the Australian Workers Union.

Incongruously perhaps, the musician Steve Kilbey​ riffed on Turnbull's youthful Labor daze.

The lead singer/songwriter with the Australian rock band the Church, Kilbey was a school debater who represented the ACT and remembers Turnbull in 1971 as both a legend in school debating circles and a ""huge"" Labor man. ""I mean he was a staunch lefty,"" Kilbey wrote in his 2014 memoir Something Quite Peculiar.

Maybe there was something in the blood: George Lansbury, the great-uncle of Turnbull's mother Coral, led the British Labour Party during the Depression.

But the variously attributed aphorism, ""if you aren't a socialist at 20, you have no heart, and if you are a socialist at 40, you have no head"", may well explain the dichotomy of Turnbull.

The name Bligh is a traditional family hand-me-down from John Turnbull, who arrived in 1802 and named a son in honour of William Bligh's support for Hawkesbury settlers against the Rum Corps.

Bligh was careless with his authority, lost it twice: The first was on HMS Bounty when the crew mutinied; the second, as the fourth governor of the Colony of NSW, when the Rum Corps mutinied. Historians blame Bligh's temper and tongue, saying he could command but not lead.

In the media, personal stories on ""the Malcolm I know"" often place adjectives like media tart, impetuous, arrogant, narcissistic against the name Turnbull.

The adjectives were all on display in June 2009 when Opposition Leader Turnbull dashed into the Parliament brandishing a false allegation against Prime Minister Kevin Rudd provided by the deluded public servant Godwin Grech.

Turnbull had allowed ABC to record the moment. Australia saw his foolish self-serving seat-of-the-pants leadership. Months later, the Liberals mutinied against his stand on climate change and he had the misfortune to lose his authority.

Turnbull is now bright and shining, personifying a possibility of a Liberal rebirth. Perhaps Labor's main hope may be that he carelessly takes his chapter and verse from the book of Bligh.

Stargazers will be treated to a rare sight this week: a supermoon and a lunar eclipse. 
 
A total lunar eclipse will share the sky with a so-called supermoon on Sunday night or early Monday, depending on where you are. 
 
The combination has not been seen since 1982, and will not happen again until 2033. 
 
A supermoon occurs when a full or new moon makes its closest approach to Earth, appearing bigger and brighter than usual. 
 
It will be the closest full moon of the year, about 30,000 miles closer than the average distance.

The moon's seasonal proximity to the Earth has led to a series of dazzling images from the night sky. Here, it is pictured in Monterrey, Mexico

A deep blue sky provides a backdrop to the supermoon in Manila, the Philippines 
                                            
The combination of the two will result in a ""blood supermoon"" - caused by it turning a rusty colour as the moon passes through the Earth's shadow. 
 
The full eclipse of the moon will last for more than an hour and be visible, weather permitting, from North and South America, Europe, Africa and western Asia. 
 
The moon, Earth and sun will be lined up at around 3.11am UK time, with the eclipse beginning a couple of hours beforehand. 
 
The next total lunar eclipse will be in 2018. 
 
This weekend's eclipse is the end of a tetrad, a series of four total lunar eclipses set six months apart. 
 
The 21st century will see eight tetrads, which is an uncommonly high number. From 1600 to 1900 there were none. 
 
Observatories are marking the event with public telescope viewings, although the eclipse will be easily visible to the naked eye. 
 
All you will have to do is look to the east, astronomers say. 
 
But if the clouds obscure your view, NASA is offering a live video feed of the entire eclipse. 
 
Many stargazers, both professional and amateur, do not like the term ""supermoon,"" noting the visible difference between a moon and supermoon is slight to all but the most faithful observers. 
 
""It's not like the difference between an ordinary man and Superman,"" said Alan MacRobert, a senior editor at Sky & Telescope magazine. 
 
""It really ought to be called a tiny, slightly little bit bigger moon, rather than the supermoon.""

PR Newswire 
 
NEW YORK, Sept. 9, 2015 
   
NEW YORK , Sept. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- About four in five Americans (77%) fail to realize that accounts with high outstanding balances hurt their credit score even if they pay the bills on time, according to a new Bankrate.com (NYSE: RATE) report. 
 
76% are unaware that closing accounts lowers their credit score. 70% would be surprised to learn that limiting themselves to just one credit account has a negative impact. And more than half of millennials don't know that having a short credit history can potentially delay major life milestones such as buying a home. 

Perhaps the most expensive misconception is that consumers must carry a credit card balance in order to improve their credit score. This is not true, but that's news to 55% of Americans. The average credit card interest rate is 15%, so someone who is carrying a balance under the false impression that it will help their credit score could easily be throwing away hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year. 

If someone makes a credit card payment more than 30 days late, 37% of U.S. adults were unable to correctly state that it will show up as a negative account on their credit report even if the bill is later paid in full. 
 
""There's a lot of confusion about credit scores,"" said Jeanine Skowronski , Bankrate.com's credit card analyst. ""Three simple rules to follow are: pay your bills on time, keep your balances low and build a diverse portfolio of long-term credit accounts.""

31985a94-cb85-4ab0-93c1-88bb945d4001,"Lewis Hamilton retained his sizzling form to complete a practice double over Nico Rosberg ahead of Sunday's Italian Grand Prix. 
 
Hamilton, 28 points ahead of Rosberg in the race for the championship, finished the opening session almost half-a-second clear of his Mercedes team-mate. 
 
But the German, who became a father for the first time on Monday, will draw confidence from the fact that he was only 0.021 seconds shy of Hamilton's best lap of one minute 24.279 secs on Friday afternoon. 
 
Mercedes have brought an upgraded engine with them to the high-speed Monza circuit and Hamilton and Rosberg were in a league of their own. 
 
Indeed Sebastian Vettel, competing in his first Italian Grand Prix weekend for Ferrari in front of the partisan Tifosi, was three-quarters of a second slower than the Mercedes duo. 
 
Force India, powered by Mercedes engines, appeared strong in opening practice and followed that up with Sergio Perez fourth and Nico Hulkenberg, who penned a new two-year contract with the team earlier this week, in fifth. 
 
Pirelli, Formula One's sole tyre supplier, was under the spotlight in Monza after two high-profile blow-outs at the Belgian Grand Prix. 
 
Vettel claimed he could have been killed following his penultimate lap puncture, whilst Rosberg was fortunate to emerge unscathed from a 190mph blow-out during practice. 
   Promoted stories   
Pirelli urged the teams to run higher tyre pressures - a concept which Hamilton claimed could have disastrous repercussions. 
 
But Hamilton's fears did not come to fruition which will have come as great relief to the under-fire Italian tyre manufacturer. 
 
McLaren's already difficult day took a turn for the worst during the second session when Jenson Button's running was restricted to just three laps. 
 
After finishing ahead of only the Manor pair of Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi on Friday morning, the 2009 world champion, who will serve a five-place grid penalty, was called into the garage with a  technical  glitch and failed to re-emerge. 
 
He finished over four seconds adrift of Hamilton in 19th and his team-mate Fernando Alonso fared little better.  The Spaniard, slapped with a 10-place grid drop after taking on his ninth engine of the campaign here, was only 16th, albeit 2.6 sec slower than Hamilton. 
 
McLaren will be joined at the back of the field for Sunday's race by Red Bull. Daniel Ricciardo has been penalised 25 places following an engine change and raft of new components.  His team-mate Daniil Kvyat, who propped up the timings in the second session, has been hit with a 15-place grid drop.

And the fact is that if one wants a filling and budget friendly meal, then one can almost always depend on good old north Indian food. There is also no dearth of outlets offering these, from roadside vendors, to small shops, to even simple joints which offer a nice, clean seating plan without the expensive prices. 

Restaurants in Saket especially have a plethora of such joints which offer delicious north Indian food at shockingly low prices, and their taste is out of the world.

Presidential contender Hillary Clinton shrugged off her slumping poll numbers on Monday and said the upcoming Democratic debates would give her a chance to draw a contrast with liberal Senator Bernie Sanders and other rivals as she makes her White House pitch directly to voters. 
 
“You’re supposed to have an election; you’re supposed to have a contest,” Clinton told reporters after a campaign event in Iowa, the state that will kick off the Democratic presidential nominating contest early next year. 
 
“When we start the debate, we will start to draw contrasts not only as I do all the time with Republicans but where appropriate with my Democratic competitors,” she said. 
 
Clinton, once the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic nomination for the 2016 presidential election, has seen her cushion dwindle in polls both nationally and in early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire amid questions about her use of a private email server for her work as secretary of state. 
 
In new Iowa polls, she has fallen into a dead heat or trails Sanders, who also has closed the gap nationally. A Reuters/Ipsos national poll on Friday showed Clinton’s one-time 30-point lead among Democrats has dipped to eight percentage points. 
 
The Vermont senator has galvanized the party’s left-leaning activists and taken advantage of what other polls show are Clinton’s declining ratings on honesty and trustworthiness fueled by the email controversy. 
 
Clinton said she was still confident about her prospects. 
 
“I’m not one of those who ever thought this was going to be a straight shot,” she told reporters. “I’ve been in and around enough campaigns to know there’s an ebb and flow. Polls go up and down; people’s decision-making changes over time.” 
 
Earlier, she told the crowd at Northern Iowa University in Cedar Falls that it was great she was having a “vigorous” discussion of ideas with Sanders and her other rivals and said the debates would give them a chance to “talk about where we agree and disagree.” 
 
The first Democratic debate is scheduled for Las Vegas, Nevada, on Oct. 13, with one more each month before the Iowa contest on Feb. 1. 
 
“In the Democratic primaries and caucuses, you have to try to earn every single person’s support. That’s what I intend to do,” Clinton said.","Clinton shrugs off slumping poll numbers, looks to debate",News,Raw Story,2015-09-14T20:32:53Z

Education minister Elias Bou Saab suggested that as many as 2% - one in 50 - of the refugees could be ""radicals"", which he said would be ""more than enough"" to cause problems.

Mr Saab spoke to journalists travelling with David Cameron on a visit to Lebanon and Jordan, during which the Prime Minister highlighted Britain's contribution of more than £1 billion to support refugee camps for displaced Syrians to stay in the region.

The minister conceded that he had no firm information on terrorist infiltration of refugees, but said his ""gut feeling"" told him it was happening.

Asked if IS - also known as Isil and Isis - could be sending militants under cover of being refugees, Mr Saab said: ""Yes, they bring some people, the smugglers. They organise groups and send them out.""

Groups were arriving which looked very different from the usual refugees, he said. ""They are all dressed with something unified, uniform, vests,"" he said.

""I don't have any information. My gut feeling is yes they are facilitating such an operation. For what reason, I don't know.""

Mr Saab said he thought militants could be going to Europe via Turkey and Greece.

aaa79735-a5ff-4d09-9de0-3cbd22108122,"OPINION: It used to hurt the Silver Ferns when Waimarama Taumaunu was criticised. 

Coaches inevitably take the fall for poor performances and the team produced some shockers with Taumaunu in charge. Last year's 18-goal loss to Australia in the Commonwealth Games final looms large over her tenure, not least because it was part of a nine-game run of defeats to the Diamonds. 

""Whatever you do, don't criticise Wai"" would be the advice of some Silver Ferns. ""She's the best coach we've ever had and it's so frustrating that the results don't show it."" 

Taumaunu frightened them at times. When she was displeased, they knew. But she laughed with them too. Maria Tutaia talked during the recent World Cup about how inspiring Taumaunu's pre-match speeches were. 

Sadly none of that counted where it matters most. In real life it's the relationships you form and the moments you share with people that are important. 

Sport's about results, though, and Taumaunu's four years as Silver Ferns head coach was marked by an inability to beat Australia. She bows out after next month's Constellation Cup series, which will be her fifth. Her only series win came in 2012. 

The Commonwealth Games and Netball World Cup were the two 'pinnacle' events of her time at the top. Australia won the final of both - 58-40 and 58-55. 

It should never be forgotten that from 2008 to 2011, Taumaunu was a very involved and influential assistant coach to Ruth Aitken. In 2010 that coaching combination won the Commonwealth Games, before being pipped by an extra-time goal in the following year's World Cup. 

After an eight-year association with the team, Taumaunu now feels it's time for her and them to part ways. It's a surprise and a shame, in some ways. 

But Taumaunu has never been one to make decisions on a whim. She'll have sound reasons and no regrets. 

With daughter Tiana Metuarau in the New Zealand Secondary Schools' team, the time is probably right for Taumaunu to enjoy being an enthusiastic and, very knowledgeable, netball mum. 

She'll take some replacing as Silver Ferns coach. Taumaunu is a hugely impressive person, whose poise and intelligence and ability to communicate always reflected well on Netball New Zealand (NNZ) and the national team. 

Australian Julie Fitzgerald must be the early favourite to take over. Already ensconced in the NNZ system, as the coach of the Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic, Fitzgerald is popular with Silver Ferns captain Casey Kopua, won the Trans-Tasman Netball League as New South Wales Swifts coach and is a former Diamonds assistant coach. 

Noeline Taurua preceded Fitzgerald at the Magic, has also won the Trans-Tasman Netball League and been an international assistant, under Taumaunu. It's understood she's interested in succeeding her former PIC clubmate as head coach and she stands a reasonable chance. 

Taurua can be blunt, though, and her relationship with NNZ hasn't always been a bed of roses. 

The Southern Steel's Janine Southby is the coach NNZ have, seemingly, groomed to replace Taumaunu, but still has a bit to prove.

074bea50-840c-4497-85b9-c0c07d18a634,"ASK Syd Kent about education and he speaks animatedly with a boyish energy and enthusiasm which belies his 68 years. 
 
“There is nothing more important than giving a child an opportunity for education,” he says. 
 
“You cannot overstate the importance of education for the nation. It has to be the most important investment.” 
 
He is well qualified to hold a view on the subject, Syd was instrumental in the formation of Colchester Sixth Form College from its inception in the early Eighties. 
 
He has been a governor there for nearly 30 years, including being chairman for 12 years. 
 
He was made an MBE in the New Year’s Honours list of 2002, although he plays that down. 
 
Not bad for a lad who left school at 15. 
 
He said: “I don’t know what I got it for. 
 
“The university put me up for it and I think it was for working there and services to education at the college. 
 
“I was not going to take it, I don’t agree with that sort of thing, but it was pointed out to me a lot of people had worked really hard to get this recognition and it would be churlish of me to turn it down. 
 
“I took my three children to the ceremony and was able to tell the taxi driver at Liverpool Street I wanted to go to Buckingham Palace, which was good.” 
   Promoted stories   
Syd, of Harwich Road, Colchester, was born in South London and left school at 15 to join the Army. He moved to Colchester as part of his service. 
 
He settled in the town after he met his first wife and went to work at Essex University as a technician. He was to stay at the university for 35 years inavariety of roles, including as an equal opportunities officer,arole he describes as a privilege. 
 
His involvement with Colchester Sixth Form College began through his involvement with the Labour party. 
 
He said: “I was chairman of the Colchester Labour Party and I stood as the Labour candidate in the county council elections of 1981 in Parson’s Heath. 
 
“I didn’t think I would get it, but we had a policy of putting a candidate in every seat. To my surprise,Iwon.” 
 
Syd got a place on the education committee. 
 
He said: “Colchester had one of the lowest stay-on rates for 16- year-olds for a town of its size in the country. Only 20 per cent were staying on past 16 and that was quite worrying. 
 
“The Labour Party proposed a sixth form college for Colchester, then we had to convince the rest of the county council, which was Tory-led. 
 
“Lord Hanningfield, or Paul White as he was then, was the chairman of the education committee and he came on board with the idea fairly soon.” 
 
It was decided to use the former Gilberd School on North Hill, which had been empty since the Gilberd had moved up to its site in north Colchester. 
 
Syd said: “We were overjoyed. 
 
“It was in the town centre and it meant everyone who lived in the town area could get transport to it. We thought it would take 850 students. We were popular from day one and we got 850 students in our first intake.” 
 
Today, the college has more than 3,000 students taking A-level and International Baccalaureate courses and is one of the highest achieving sixth form colleges in the country. 
 
However, the development of the college has not been without its challenges. 
 
Syd said: “When Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, there was pressure on sixth form colleges to provide vocational studies, as well as A-levels. 
 
“We have always worked closely with Colchester Institute and although Margaret Thatcher was competition, competition, competition, we did not want to be competitive with the institute; we wanted to complement them and still do today.” 
 
The mention of Government intervention triggersachange in Syd from likeable, positive and engaging, to something akin to Sir Alex Ferguson in hairdryer mode. 
 
Government, he says, is, without doubt the worst influence on colleges such as Colchester’s. 
 
“All governments,” he clarifies. 
 
“Why can’t they leave the professionals alone to get on with the job? Why do they think they know better? 
 
“The worst of all was not Margaret Thatcher, or Major or Blair, it was Gove. As for the current Government, I feel they just want to get rid of sixth form colleges. 
 
They are cutting funds massively again and again. 
 
“Sixth forms offer the best value for money in this country’s education system and yet we get less per students than schools. 
 
“Our teachers are paid less than school teachers. Sixth form colleges still have to pay VAT, when schools don’t.” 
 
Syd’s smile returns, almost apologetically. He should not apologise about his passion nor for caring so deeply about the college and its staff and students. 
 
After 30 years, Syd has decided to step down from the board of governors. 
 
His thirst for knowledge, however, will continue and he is a member of the U3A and does courses with the WEA. 
 
But he will miss the teachers and staff, who he describes as brilliant, but the time has come.

The Liberal Democrats will give preferences to the Labor Party ahead of Liberal Party candidate Andrew Hastie at the Canning byelection. 

The preference swap deal with the ALP is a blow to Prime Minister Tony Abbott whose future could hinge on the strength of result in Canning. 

The Liberal Democrats have the second place on the byelection ballot paper and a source said: ""This is a problem for the Liberals in a tight race"". 

But it is also unclear whether the Liberal Democrats will have the network of support in WA to hand out how-to-vote cards at all booths in Canning. 

Liberal Democrat Senator David Leyonhjelm famously took ten per cent of the upper house primary vote in NSW in the 2013 federal election after drawing the ""donkey vote"" position at number one on the ballot. 

Liberal Party director Brian Loughnane believes that most of those votes were cast by voters who thought they were voting Liberal rather than Liberal Democrat. 

Senator Leyonhjelm said recently that his party is ""absolutely out of love with the Liberals"" and the preference deal, expected to be announced at just after midday, is more proof of that. 

At the 2013 election, the party gave its preferences to the Coalition ahead of Labor and the Greens but the Liberal Party is challenging the Liberal Democrats in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal where it is hoping to prevent the use of the term ""Liberal Democrats"". The party, which was once called Liberty and Democracy, re-registered as Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 

Senator Leyonhjelm is also at loggerheads with the government, which has indicated its desire to legislate out of existence the Senate group voting ticket – the preference swap system responsible for the rise of the crossbench micro parties. 

Glenn Druery, the so-called preference whisperer, told Fairfax Media, that the preference deal has the potential to have a ""major impact"" on the result. 

""Given that their candidate has the number two spot on the paper, they are in a really favourable position and if they tell their voters to preference the ALP [candidate Matt Keogh] then this will have an effect,"" he said. 

The Liberal Democrat candidate, Connor Whittle, is a Perth draftsman.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was detained in Turkey on Tuesday after the family went missing from their home in north-east London last week. 
  The woman will reappear at Southwark Crown Court   
She appeared at Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court in London today, where she indicated she would plead not guilty and refused to stand in the dock before District Judge Susan Green. 

			 
The defendant told the judge: ""I'm sorry, it's part of my religion, so I would prefer to sit down.""

""She called at the last minute and had something come up and said I can't make it,"" said Baker. 

Her mom was supposed to watch their kids. And since the invitation said no children, that meant no wedding. But then this week, she received a bill for the dinner they were supposed to have enjoyed. 

""You've got to be kidding me,"" she said with a smile. ""It listed, we would have had twoherb crusted walleye and there was also a service and tax charge."" 

The total came to $75.90. 

""This cost reflects the amount paid by the bride and groom for meals that were RSVP'd for, reimbursement and explanation for no show, card, call or text would be appreciated,"" the note read.

She has no plans on paying it, but she did wonder what else she could have done. 

""I guess I don't know what the right answer would have been. What the right thing to do would have been,"" she said. 

She certainly got a lot of advice after posting the bill to Facebook. KARE 11's page alone had hundreds and hundreds of comments. 

""This is kind of the wild story,"" said Sarah Baumann Rogers. 

She's the editor of  Minnesota Bride  magazine and has some experience on wedding etiquette. 

""Under no circumstances should you choose to follow up after the fact...kind of questioning why they couldn't attend or much less sending a bill,"" she said. 

But she understood why couples would be upset after spending a lot of money on the wedding and then some guests skip out, which is why she tells people to notify the hosts as soon as possible if you can't attend. 

She also said don't let RSVP's linger. Respond as soon as you can and if you say you're attending, stick to it. But she added sometimes things come up. 

""General rule is prepare for about 10 percent of overage or underage when you're planning a big event like that and catering companies are well aware of this,"" she said.

5a0effd7-6c90-46b0-80ec-423d6375f708,"Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg remains optimistic about Australia's economic outlook in the face of a slowing global economy. 

Speaking ahead of the release of the June quarter growth figures on Wednesday, Mr Frydenberg believes there are some good signs in the economy. 

""But there's no doubt about it, we can't be complacent and the economic reform agenda must continue,"" he told ABC radio. 

The world was slowing, particularly China, and that was affecting Australian exports of resources. 

But the economy was benefiting from a lower Australian dollar that would make exports cheaper, Mr Frydenberg said. 

Economists expect the national accounts to show the economy grew by around 0.5 per cent in the June quarter compared with 0.9 per cent growth in the previous three months - one of the fastest quarterly expansions in the world during that period. 

That slowdown will partly reflect weak exports at the start of the quarter when bad weather shut key coal ports on the east cost in April. 

Such an outcome would drag the annual rate down to 2.2 per cent from 2.3 per cent as of March, well below the long term average of three to 3.25 per cent. 

It would also suggest that the jobless rate, already at a 13-year peak of 6.3 per cent, will remain high for while yet. 

Treasurer Joe Hockey will respond to Wednesday's figures before heading off to Turkey for a G20 finance ministers meeting in Ankara. 

International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde has said that global economic growth is likely to be weaker than was expected just a few months ago, remaining at moderate levels. 

Asia was still expected to lead global growth, but the pace was slowing and could sag further because of recent financial market volatility, she said.",Can't be complacent about GDP:Frydenberg,News,Yahoo! Xtra Business,2015-09-01T23:31:49Z

Comments 

A study of young Australians has shown a shocking attitude towards technology and privacy. 

Almost half of the 1,923 people studied, all of whom were aged between 16 and 24, thought that it was acceptable to track their partners by going through their phones or installing tracking software. 

This was one of the findings from a national study by VicHealth in Australia, with the aim of finding out attitudes towards violence against women. 

Although 84% said that tracking a partner by electronic means without their consent was serious, 46% said they thought in some cases it was acceptable. 

There are now many ways to track people online, with and without their knowledge. 

The Google Play store has one such app, that is marketed at parents who want to keep track of their children. 

You can see where they are at all times, when they have turned their phone off, and read all their SMS messages. 

Other findings showed worrying attitudes towards relationships from young people. 

Is it ever acceptable to spy on your partner using an app? 

20% of those surveyed thought that women often say ""no"" to sexual activity when they really mean yes, and 18% said that if a woman was raped while affected by drugs or alcohol, she was partly responsible. 

Snooping is not just a phenomenon in Australia; a study in 2013 on UK adults in relationships showed that 62 per cent of men and 34 per cent of women had looked through a current or ex-partner's phone without their knowledge. 

However, doing so is risky business - 31% of those surveyed said that they would consider ending the relationship if they found their partner had gone through their phone without their knowledge.",Nearly half of young people think it is acceptable to stalk their partners using technology,News,Telegraph,2015-09-24T00:00:00Z

Current domestic ferry service provider Väinamere Liinid, owned by Vjatšeslav Leedo, has taken former economic minister Urve Palo to court, accusing her of lying about the tender for the ferry service, which was won by a state-owned company. 
  
Leedo's Väinamere Liinid has serviced major domestic ferry routes for the past 20 years, but in September 2016, the state-owned Port of Tallinn will take over, winning a procurement to provide the service for the next decade. 
 
Leedo told Eesti Päevaleht on the weekend, that Palo lied about a number of aspects of the tender. He then said his company is planning to sue Palo, and a spokesman for the Harju County Court has now confirmed that Väinamere Liinid has taken legal action. 
 
In the interview, Leedo said the first round of the procurement was organized to see his company's bid, so that in the second round, Port of Tallinn could copy it. 
 
He also said the total price of the new ferries ordered by Port of Tallinn is much higher than published, adding that his offer was cheaper for the state. Väinamere Liinid currently nets around 15-17 million euros annually in subsidies. 
 
The new tender was worth around 200 million euros over 10 years, but a requirement was that the ferries should be new. Palo's ministry, when announcing the winner in 2014, said the competitors bid was 60 million euros higher than that of the Port of Tallinn. 
 
Palo said the tender was appealed and contested in court, as well as by the Ministry of Finance, but the tender was always ruled to have been correct. 
 
In the same interview, Leedo also accused Port of Tallinn supervisory board head Remo Holsmer of asking him for bribes. Holsmer has denied the charge and has promised to take Leedo to court.",Leedo takes ex-minister Palo to court (1),News,Eesti Televisioon,2015-09-17T09:42:14Z

The study showed the project to had robust economics for an increased one-million ton a year low-cost, high-grade gold project, producing 100 000 oz of gold in the first year and 79 000 oz/y over a six-and-a-half-year mine-life.

“Our internal examination of the improved geotechnical parameters and production schedule, when included in the current financial model indicates meaningful improvements to the economics of the project,” Hummingbird said in a statement on Tuesday.

d012f171-9d63-429b-b34f-04b109fdfae3,"GALESBURG — It was a high school football game between a Galesburg team still trying to learn how to consistently win and a Marion team where winning is a habit. The Silver Streaks - who've made the IHSA playoffs two of the past three years - took on a Wildcats program that has made 10 straight postseason trips. Despite the disparity in experience, it proved to be quite a battle on a sunny Saturday — much like the playoff contests played in November. Marion (2-1) needed a second-half comeback to beat 1-2 Galesburg 26-24. ""It was like a heavyweight fight - a back and forth battle,"" said Marion coach Kerry Martin. ""I guess we ended up winning on points late."" Not only a good analogy, but an accurate description of the game. Galesburg took a 6-0 lead on Caleb Clay's blocked punt and Jason Kelly's 31-yard return for a touchdown in the first quarter but fell behind on Marion drives of 80 and 89 yards - the last one taking just over a minute - to fall behind 14-6 at the half. Re-energized to start the third quarter, the Streaks used a 23-yard run by junior quarterback Jacob Ross and his 31-yard TD pass to Nick Miyler to regain a 21-14 lead with 1:21 left in the period. Freshman James Haden then added a 22-yard field goal following a fumble recover by Tyree Mitchell to give the Streaks a 24-14 lead with 11:07 left in the game. A week after he'd rushed for 301 yards against LaSalle-Peru, junior DeAndre Moren ran for 199 yards against Marion. But Galesburg's inexperience reared its ugly head in the fourth quarter. ""We had the opportunities to win the ballgame but we didn't capitalize,"" said Galesburg coach Tim Dougherty. ""We had good effort and good attitude but they (the Wildcats) are a good ballclub."" He added, ""Their quarterback is so good and he made plays when he had too. He was the difference maker."" Marion's senior quarterback Izak Baker lit up the stats line with s 17-for-32 passing day for 178 yards and two touchdowns. But it was his 56-yard heave to sophomore receiver Jaden Lacy with 4:30 left to play that put Marion ahead 24-20 and won the game. It was one of Lacy's three TD catches in the game. ""So far this season, I think our defense has played as good as any defense since I've been here,"" said Dougherty. ""They just gave up some big plays."" Galesburg had two chances to regain the lead in the final four minutes. On a fourth and 4 at Marion's 32 with 2:04 left, Ross threw a pass incomplete into the end zone. The Streaks forced a Marion punt with 11.9 seconds to play and managed to get off two plays before time expired. Page 2 of 2 - Sophomore Jacob Carl made a 19-yard pass reception to give Galesburg a first down at Marion's 37 but a Hail Mary pass into the end zone was tipped by Wildcats defenders and fell just beyond a diving Miyler as time expired.

afea7e62-73d2-4523-b31d-1dc928ddd48e,"By Emmanuel Onwubiko 
 
PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari is just in his 100 days in office as the  president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria but he has so far made major appointments that have generated a ground swell of criticism of alienation of the Igbo speaking South East of Nigeria. 
Constitutionally, these appointments and the exclusion of the South East implies that nearly 45 million Nigerians of Igbo extraction in South East of Nigeria won’t be represented in the nation’s highest defence policy making body – The National Security Council. Article 25 of the 3rd schedule in part one of the constitution say as follows; 
The National Security Council shall comprise the following members –The president who shall be the Chairman; The Vice-President who shall be the Deputy Chairman; The Chief of Defence Staff; The Minister of the Government of the Federation charged with the responsibility for internal affairs; The Minister of the Government of the Federation charged with the responsibility for defence;  The Minister of the Government of the Federation charged with the responsibility for foreign affairs; The National Security Adviser; The Inspector-General of Police; and Such other persons as the President may in his discretion appoint. The Council shall have power to advise the President on matters relating to public security, including matters relating to any organisation or agency established by law for ensuring the security of the federation. 
Apart from the implicit discriminatory tone of these appointments which are in violation of section 42(1) of the chapter four of the constitution on the imperative of avoiding discrimination of any ethnic bloc in the formulation of governmental policies, the failure to include the South East in this all important security forum amounts to alienation of the Igbo speaking population current government. 
Already most learned minds observing political developments  have criticized the Buhari administration for these manifest acts of alienation and outright discrimination against the Igbo of South East of Nigeria. 
These groundswell of criticisms against President Buhari in view of emerging facts that not only that the Igbo speaking nationality has started suffering systematic marginalization under his watch in terms of strategic appointments also in key economic positions the South East has been left in the lurch even as one of the most vociferous supporters of Buhari Governor Adams Oshiomhole recently admonished the South East to look for projects and not appointments. Oshiomhole alongside his ilk forgot that the fundamentals of policy-making influences are facilitated by key occupants of strategic  positions in the various power configurations and political layers of authority in Nigeria. 
When people pontificate against respect for the constitutional principle of Federal Character representations in the allocation of political offices and decide to hide under the deceptive canopy of merit and competence, they conveniently remain in denial of the fundamental reality that Federal Character principle accommodate competence and merit. It prevents a scenario in which persons s from the segment of the society that produced the president would be picked to man strategic posts in government to the total exclusion of other component parts. Federal Character principle allows for equitable distribution of political offices and safeguards the nation from nepotism and tribalism. Let Buhari stop creating impression that his government is a government for the Northern Nigeria and by Northern Nigerians. This is not too much a task for him to undertake since he is not the SARDAUNA OF NORTHERN NIGERIA  but the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. 
In the book “Public Policy: Formulation,  Implementation and Evaluation” written by RK Sapru the aforementioned point I highlighted on Policy influences vis- a – vis top public office holders and their proximity to sources of power largely determines the equitable redistribution of national wealth and sitting of projects of significant economic values. 
He wrote thus: “Official policy-makers are those who occupy the formal offices prescribed by the political community as authoritative. They are members of the legislature, local councilors, ministers, senior officials and judges”. 
This public policy expert wrote further that: “Since governments at the national level are formed usually by the leaders of the political party with the majority of seats in the legislature, it is important to understand how the parliamentary leadership is likely to behave. In the actual process of government, it is widely recognized that parliament is dominated by the executive in policy-making. Its supremacy is said to be real only in a legalistic sense. The executive, and the power within it, especially of the cabinet, is of critical value to the policy-making function of the government.” 
My position on the necessity of including Representatives of all affiliations in top government offices, the writer of the book cited above affirmed thus: “The bureaucracy’s political and policy-making roles have been investigated. The judiciary is also considered an important element in the policy process. The impact of judges on policy-making, and attitudes towards judicial power in the system of government.” 
THE South-East South-South Professionals of Nigeria (SESSPN), a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) which is said to be “engaged in promoting good governance and rapid, sustainable and inclusive development” in the two geo-political zones of the country, has expressed concern about allegations that the new All Progressives Congress (APC) Federal Government, may be out to “alienate” the zones from general development in Nigeria. These persons aren’t alone because even a prominent Law, Professor Ben Nwabueze has expressed concern over the emerging lopsided appointments that we have witnessed so far. 
In a letter addressed to President Buhari and signed by its president, Emeka Ugwu-Oju and Secretary, Dagogo Karibi-Whyte, the group, which described the two zones as “major enablers of the Nigerian economy”, highlighted some recent events that fuelled its fears that the geo-political may indeed be on the road to alienation. 
In the letter dated July 29, 2015, the SESSPN drew the attention of President Buhari to some “extant issues” which included the speech of the President during a visit to the United States of America, alleged lopsidedness in key appointments by the Federal Government and the threats against Senator Ike Ekweremadu’s emergence as the Deputy Senate President. 
The letter, which was copied to many political leaders of the two zones across political divides, however expressed the readiness of the people of the zones to work with the rest of the country to achieve the change dream that the APC government desires. 
Highlighting the causes of the fear of marginalization, the SESSPN referred to: 
A recent remark by Your Excellency whilst being interviewed at the Institute of Peace, Washington DC by Ambassador Johnnie Carson, former US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. Whilst responding to a question regarding the Niger Delta, Your Excellency stated, inter alia; “the states that voted 97 percent for me will be treated differently from those that voted 5 percent for me”. In other words, all Nigerians will not get equal treatment under your administration. Based on the last Presidential election results, the people of the South-East and South-South zones will of course be classified as those that voted 5 percent for you.

40a5a99a-d520-4840-a03e-f041623bed3c,"- Results show PD-L1 expression correlated with response to atezolizumab 

- Data will be submitted to global health authorities, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 

Basel - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced early results from a pivotal phase II study, IMvigor 210, of the investigational cancer immunotherapy atezolizumab (anti-PDL1; MPDL3280A) in people with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). The study showed that atezolizumab shrank tumours (objective response rate, ORR) in 27 percent of people with mUC whose disease had medium and high levels of PD-L1 expression and worsened after initial treatment. Ninety-two percent of people who responded to atezolizumab continued to respond when the results were assessed. Median duration of response was not yet reached. Adverse events were consistent with those observed in previous studies. 

""These results may represent the first major treatment advancement in advanced bladder cancer in nearly 30 years,"" said Sandra Horning, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. ""We are encouraged that responses to atezolizumab were ongoing in the large majority of people when the study results were assessed."" 

Roche is planning to submit these data to global health authorities and to the FDA under a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of people whose metastatic bladder cancer expresses PD-L1. This designation is designed to expedite the development and review of medicines intended to treat serious diseases that may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies. About the IMvigor 210 study 

These final results from cohort 2 of this study (minimum of 24 weeks' follow-up) will be presented in an oral session presentation by Jonathan E. Rosenberg, MD, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, USA (Abstract #21LBA) on Sunday, 27 September, 10:40 Central European Time (CET). 

Atezolizumab in patients (pts) with locally-advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC): Results from a pivotal multicenter phase II study (IMvigor 210). 

IMvigor 210 is an open-label, multicentre, single-arm phase II study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab in people with locally advanced or mUC, regardless of PD-L1 expression. People in the study were enrolled into one of two cohorts. Cohort 1 consisted of people who had received no prior therapies for locally advanced or mUC, but who were ineligible for first-line cisplatin-based therapy; results for this cohort are not yet mature. Cohort 2, for which results were announced today, included people whose disease had progressed during or following previous treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. People received a 1200-mg intravenous dose of atezolizumab on day one of 21-day cycles until progressive disease (Cohort 1) or loss of clinical benefit (Cohort 2). 

The primary endpoint of the study was ORR. Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DoR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. People were selected by histology, prior lines of therapy and PD-L1 expression on tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC), using an investigational immunohistochemistry (IHC) test that is being developed by Roche Diagnostics. 

In addition to IMvigor 210, Roche has an ongoing randomised phase III study, IMvigor 211, comparing atezolizumab with standard-of-care chemotherapy in people who have mUC that worsened after initial treatment. All studies include the evaluation of a companion test developed by Roche Diagnostics to determine PD-L1 status. About metastatic urothelial cancer 

Metastatic urothelial cancer is associated with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. It is a disease that has seen no major advancements for nearly 30 years. Urothelial cancer is the ninth most common cancer worldwide, with 430,000 new cases diagnosed in 2012, and it results in approximately 145,000 deaths globally each year. Men are three times more likely to suffer from urothelial cancer compared with women, and it is also three times more common in developed countries than in less developed countries. About atezolizumab 

Atezolizumab (anti-PDL1; MPDL3280A) is an investigational monoclonal antibody designed to interfere with a protein called PD-L1. Atezolizumab is designed to target PD-L1 expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, preventing it from binding to PD-1 and B7.1 on the surface of T cells. By inhibiting PD-L1, atezolizumab may enable the activation of T cells. 

All studies of atezolizumab include the evaluation of an investigational IHC test that uses the antibody SP142 to measure PD-L1 expression on both tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells. The goal of PD-L1 as a biomarker is to identify those people most likely to benefit when treated with atezolizumab alone, and to determine which people may benefit most from a combination of atezolizumab and another medicine. There are 11 ongoing or planned phase III studies of atezolizumab across certain kinds of lung, kidney, breast and bladder cancer. About Roche in personalised cancer immunotherapy

Six aces, zero double faults. No break points faced. Seventy-nine percent of first-serve points won. Eighteen winners, six unforced errors. Forty-three percent of return points won. Six service points lost in first set, six service points lost in second set, all against a 20-year-old in the midst of her best season which included pushing Sunday’s opponent hard in the Australian Open semifinals, saving eight match points before eventually falling to the world No. 1. 
 
So, you can say Serena Williams brought her A+ game on Sunday. She was at 110%. She was firing on all cylinders. Use whatever sports cliche you want, but if Serena Williams plays three more matches like that, she’ll roll to her fourth-straight U.S. Open title, her fifth-straight Grand Slam title, her record-tying 22nd major win and, most importantly, just the fourth calendar Slam in the history of tennis. Serena, in desperate need of a mental pick-me-up after two tight matches at the Open, got what she needed against the 19th-seeded Keys — a quick 6-3, 6-3 fourth-round win that was more hard-fought than the scoreline suggests. 
 
() 
 
In the first set, both women were serving phenomenally, staying on serve at 4-3 and collectively losing just eight service points combined. And then, just like that, Keys played a loose point, Serena nailed a winner, serve was broken and what had been a tight set was blown wide open. The same thing happened in the second, though Keys wasn’t as dominant on her serve early — at 1-1 she had to survive a four-deuce game early. Then at 3-3 once again, Keys looked like she’d be cruising to her own 4-3 lead (she was up 40-15 in the game) but, much like in the first set, she played a few loose points, Serena hit a winner and what had been a tight set was blown wide open. Against an on-her-game Serena, it can come in the blink of an eye. Keys played well and got pummeled in what might have been Serena’s finest Grand Slam match of the year. 
 
Serena’s first round-match was a virtual walkover over a low-ranked player who was hurt and had to retire in the second set. But in her next two matches, Serena showed the nerves of someone playing under the pressure of looming athletic immortality. She struggled against Kiki Bertens and lost the first set to Bethanie Mattek-Sands, having to dig out of trouble in the second to force a third. 
 
(USA TODAY Sports Images) 
 
All that tightness disappeared over the holiday weekend. Serena has now won 32 straight Grand Slam matches and moves to 52-2 on the season. In the quarterfinal, she’ll face her sister Venus, who won her match on Sunday in a tournament-fastest 50 minutes. We’ll preview that one in the coming days ( it’s the sisters’ 14th Grand Slam meeting and 26th overall ) but for now, Serena’s biggest threat at the Open (herself) has been neutralized. If she plays loose tennis, the rest of the field, including her sister, doesn’t have a shot. 
 
Getting closer to that historic calendar Slam will almost certainly bring the pressure back yet, for one day at least, Serena played a match befitting the greatest athlete of her generation. Four down, three to go.

LONDON (Scrap Register): London  has come top of a listing of maritime service centres published in English on  Thursday by the Baltic Exchange and Xinhua, China’s news agency, whilst  Singapore heads the overall list for its combined port and maritime services  offering. 

The International Shipping Centre Development Index (ISCD)  covers 46 of the world’s largest ports and cities and is designed to bring  clarity to investors and governments on the relative performance of shipping  centres around the world. 

London makes second place on the overall  index, closely followed by Hong Kong. All three cities have large port  facilities and support comprehensive maritime business service  sectors. 

Shanghai has moved up to sixth place, overtaking Dubai. Tokyo  has dropped out of the top ten with Athens taking its place at number  ten. 

Of the top ten global shipping centres, four are in Asia, four in  Europe, one in the Middle East and one in the USA. 

The report also  provides a supplementary ranking, grading cities based solely on the breadth and  depth of their maritime services sector. London tops this ranking, followed by  Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Athens. 

Commenting on the report’s  findings during London International Shipping Week, Baltic Exchange Chief  Executive Jeremy Penn said: “Singapore and London have continued to thrive for  many reasons not least because of their locations, experience, strong legal  frameworks, tax frameworks and the ease of doing business. As an international  shipping organisation with members all around the world, the Baltic finds this  report useful for demonstrating to governments the important role that a  successful shipping centre plays for any country.

e56fca20-9347-45ca-a533-16dfd2009908,"An inquest witness described hearing two “almighty bangs” as a Welsh Assembly tea lady fell to her death through a communal rooftop outside her Cardiff home. 
 
Jane Wedlake, 54, fell 18ft through the rooftop’s glass atrium outside her one-bedroom home in St Mary Street in the city centre on November 16 last year. 
 
On the second day of the inquest at Cardiff Coroner’s Court neighbour Liam Woodland, who lives in a flat a storey below the property Ms Wedlake shared with her partner Greg Capron, said he was in his living room at the time of the incident. 
 'There was no eye contact'  
Liam said: “All of a sudden I heard two almighty bangs two to three seconds apart from each other. 
 
“One was a little more shallow and then a deep, very loud bang. 
 
“I jumped straight from my settee and ran around the building to have a look. From my window I could see Jane’s body on the first-floor landing. 
 
He added: “Jane wasn’t speaking to me. She was making noises but I don’t know if that was involuntary or not. There was no eye contact or response. 
 
“I assumed she had slipped and fallen through the glass roof.” 
 
 The coroner's court in Cardiff where the inquest is taking place 
 
Ms Wedlake fell from a communal rooftop accessed by a window close to her property, the inquest had earlier been told. 
 
Mr Woodland said he possessed a key to a similar window on his floor that could be used to open those inside his flat and he assumed it could open any window in the block and other residents, including Ms Wedlake, had similar keys. 
 Routine inspections  
The properties are managed by Cardiff Community Housing Association and maintenance officer Martin Smith said he had routinely inspected the residence and filled in a report each time. 
 
But he said he was not aware residents had been using the window to access the roof area and that keys could be used to access different windows like the window to the roof. 
 
Mr Smith said it therefore didn’t seem urgent to check the roof during routine inspections because access to it was not allowed. 
 Signs erected  
He also said the glass was not intended to support the weight of a person. 
 
But he said he and maintenance workers had accessed the roof area on one occasion a few days before Ms Wedlake’s fall to carry out urgent repairs on a Sky satellite after a “dynamic risk assessment”. 
 
Following Ms Wedlake’s fall the roof area has been closed off, he said, with signs erected reading: “Danger: fragile roof” and “Restoration area: no roof access”. 
 
Ms Wedlake died at the University Hospital of Wales , Heath, 12 days after the fall having never regained consciousness. 
 
Her partner Mr Capron said he assumed she had been collecting her work uniform, which had been hanging out over the roof area to dry, before the fatal fall.

5d36d287-6e9f-41e7-a599-f22ca218e41c,"It has been nearly six months since MP Suella Fernandes was voted into her constituency. 

There was a flurry of excitement mixed with some nervous apprehension when Suella Fernandes was elected to her Fareham seat earlier this year. 

She replaced long­-standing MP Mark Hoban, and some claimed the 35-year-old barrister from London had been parachuted in by the Conservative party, while others criticised her for her race, gender and relative youthfulness. 

But the politician ignored those comments and she dug her heels in, determined to prove her critics wrong and to show Fareham that it had made the right choice. 

Since moving to Locks Heath with her family shortly after the election in May, she’s been busy in the Fareham constituency. 

The News caught up with her to see some of the places she has been and topics that have caught her attention. 

CITIZEN’S ADVICE BUREAU

WHEN you need advice in Fareham, many residents turn to the Citizen’s Advice Bureau. Miss Fernandes visited the Fareham office, which is situated above the library in the town centre, to find out what goes on there and how it works. 

She went on a tour of the facility, and said she was impressed with the consultation rooms and the call centre, which is manned by volunteers. 

She met staff and found out some of the issues commonly raised by customers, such as housing and pensions. 

Staff told her about the struggle many are facing to get a mortgage and how many pensioners are turning to them for advice on their pensions and savings. 

Miss Fernandes said: ‘The work of the CAB in Fareham is exceptional. 

‘I would urge anyone looking to volunteer to contact the centre as not only is their work invaluable, but the atmosphere is so friendly too.’

GAFIRS 

MORE needs to be done to extend facilities at Fareham Community Hospital so that constituents can be seen more quickly, according to MP Suella Fernandes.

Hospital volunteers were delighted to show the politician the work they do and Miss Fernandes spent the day with the Friends of Fareham Community Hospital, a group of people that volunteer at the Sarisbury Green facility.

She said: ‘Fareham Community Hospital is a fantastic facility but it is clear that it can be put to more and better use.’ 

The centre opened in May 2010 and the 2,700sq ft hospital provides services such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, MRI, abdominal aortic aneurism Screening, phlebotomy booking service and blood testing and a Dementia Support Group. 

In addition, Brook Lane GP Surgery hold occasional clinics within the hospital.

Miss Fernandes said: ‘While it is a modern and well-­equipped hospital, I receive a lot of letters from constituents who struggle to get an appointment with a GP within two weeks, or have had to travel to QA for routine check-ups and minor injuries. 

‘Given that our local population is steadily increasing, it would make sense to make more use of Fareham Community Hospital and I wholeheartedly support a plan to make it a minor injuries unit with adjoining maternity and elderly wards.’ 

She said she was concerned about the lack of a breast cancer screening unit at the hospital, meaning that residents in the western wards of Fareham have to travel to Whiteley or Portsmouth.

She said: ‘I believe that this is unacceptable since the mobile unit could very easily locate itself onsite on specified days. In addition, overnight beds at the Hospital would help to ease pressure on existing services.’ 

Other issues that caught her attention during the visit were the lack of bus services to the hospital and the proposed closure of Bitterne Walk-in Centre, as patients from the Fareham area account for 5.5 per cent of the walk-­in attendance there, and she has since been in touch with Fareham and Gosport Clinical Commissioning Group, which funds many health services in the area. 

She said: ‘Part of my work is to keep speaking up on behalf of Fareham residents when it comes to trying to get a better deal with Fareham Community Hospital and local bus services and I will continue to do so.’

MIND 

FOLLOWING her visit to mental health charity Mind, Suella Fernandes called for better mental health services.

She met campaigners and representatives from South East and Central Essex Mind and Solent Mind to hear the experiences of people living with mental health problems in the area. 

She said: ‘I’m concerned about the need for better mental health services in Fareham and I wanted to hear of the experiences of people living with mental health problems. 

‘Supporting constituents with mental health problems is one of the biggest challenges we face as a country. 

‘I was so pleased to see the excellent work Mind is carrying out here in Fareham.’

Every year, mental health problems affect one in four people, which is more people than will develop heart disease or cancer. 

Miss Fernandes said: ‘I hope to play a vital role in securing good quality support for people in Fareham, as well as promoting mental health at a national level.’ 

She said she was also committed to providing more mental health support to women during and after pregnancy. 

During her visit to Mind, in West Street, Miss Fernandes trained as a Dementia Friend, helping her to understand the syndrome and how to deal with sufferers.

FAREHAM COMMUNITY HOSPITAL 

MORE needs to be done to extend facilities at Fareham Community Hospital so that constituents can be seen more quickly, according to MP Suella Fernandes.

Hospital volunteers were delighted to show the politician the work they do and Miss Fernandes spent the day with the Friends of Fareham Community Hospital, a group of people that volunteer at the Sarisbury Green facility.

She said: ‘Fareham Community Hospital is a fantastic facility but it is clear that it can be put to more and better use.’

She said: ‘Part of my work is to keep speaking up on behalf of Fareham residents when it comes to trying to get a better deal with Fareham Community Hospital and local bus services and I will continue to do so.’

FIRE

ONE of the hottest topics for any MP at the moment is the cuts to the fire service and how they will affect people living in their constituency. 

As a consultation was launched earlier this month, which is asking for people’s views on the savings, Suella Fernandes spent a day with the crew at Fareham fire station. 

She took part in the firefighters’ normal day, starting at 9am, including equipment checks, operational effectiveness training and community safety activities.

She discussed local and national challenges facing the service with Hampshire chief officer Dave Curry and Fareham station manager Danny Miles. 

Miss Fernandes took part in many activities including entering the firefighter training facility, which saw her wear full protection including breathing equipment in an adapted house in which the fire crew simulated a fire. 

The station simulated a car crash site to show her the skill and patience it takes for firefighters to free trapped casualties. 

She said: ‘I’m grateful to the fire service for hosting me. The quality of training and dedication by the crew is exceptional. 

‘Their job is one that requires high levels of commitment, both physically and mentally, and they carry out their duties with great care for the Fareham community.’

The visit coincided with proposals to transform the way the police, fire and rescue and ambulance services work together, which were unveiled by the Prime Minister on September 11.

Miss Fernandes said: ‘Having visited all three emergency services this summer, I have seen the specialist skills and expertise of our professionals. 

‘However, there is a lot of overlap. It doesn’t make sense for emergency services to have different premises, different back offices and different IT systems when their work is so closely related and they often share the same boundaries. 

‘I saw how well the police and fire service work well together, and with better joint staffing, the emergency services can only be strengthened. 

‘This sort of smarter working can benefit everyone by freeing up resources to invest in fire prevention programmes, and allowing for faster response times when incidents occur ­ saving lives and saving taxpayers’ money.’ 

She urged residents to have their say in the consultation being run by Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service.",MP Suella takes a look round her patch,News,Portsmouth Today,2015-09-22T13:59:17Z

Inspired by Buddhist scripture, HOTO merges Miyajima's philosophical appreciation of life with high-tech approach in an 18-foot mirrored pagoda featuring 3,827 vibrantly colored LED displays

LAS VEGAS 

Experience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7632251-mgm-resorts-tatsuo-miyajima-hoto-art/ 

Inspired by Buddhist scripture, HOTO – meaning ""treasure pagoda"" – refers to a story about a monumental bejeweled tower that emerges from the ground, floats midair and covers half the world, symbolizing the importance of every human life. According to Buddhist teachings, life cannot be described without such an impossible story because life is nothing but a miracle.

It was this scripture and the devastating events of September 11, 2001 

To share his message, Miyajima – recognized for work that merges a philosophical appreciation of life with the latest technologies – created a remarkable mirrored pagoda measuring 18 feet high and more than six feet around, inlaid with 3,827 vibrantly colored LED numerical displays in varying sizes. The LED displays flash the numbers nine through one in a descending, continuous series and at varying speeds, representing the never-ending cycle of life, the universal language of numbers and how every life moves at its own unique pace.

Focusing on interaction rather than exhibition, the circular tower features angled surfaces that play with the viewer's reflection, allowing them to visually locate themselves in the art. This is indicative of Miyajima's work in recent years, by which he summarizes his belief that art is the expression of creativity within each of us. ""I'm trying to show that every human being is unique,"" Miyajima explained.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi addressing the public meeting at the inauguration of the New Housing Scheme, in Chandigarh on September 11, 2015.  
Lashing out at the Opposition for not letting Parliament function during the Monsoon Session, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Friday that the deadlock in Lok Sabha has forced him to raise issues in the “Jan Sabha” — or people’s assembly. 
 
Modi was addressing a rally in Chandigarh where he inaugurated the new international airport terminal and also attended the convocation at PGI, besides inaugurating other projects. This was Modi’s first visit to Chandigarh after he took over as the Prime Minister. 
 
Hitting out at the Opposition, Modi said the people of the country will not forgive political  parties for the way Parliament functioned. “You have been elected and sent to Parliament. Go to the House, hold discussions for two days, five days or seven days. However, not accepting rules of democracy, not paying heed to 400 Members of Parliament and 40 people conspiring to put roadblocks is an insult to democracy,” said Modi. 
 
He said it was time people pressured their MPs to attend Parliament, facilitate its functioning and raise issues. He said that because of the “pride” of a few persons, Parliament is being divided and not being allowed to function. 
 
Modi said that if their voice is suppressed in Lok Sabha, then he will go to Jan Sabha. “Today, I am presenting my Lok Sabha case in Jan Sabha,” he said. 
 
In his 26-minute address, Modi said it was in Chandigarh that he had said that serious steps will be taken for implementation of One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme. Stating that people from the region joined Armed Forces in large numbers, Modi said every family in the region is like a “Suraksha Kavach” for the nation. 
 
He accused previous governments of not seriously considering the OROP issue. 
 
That is why the previous government allocated Rs 500 crore for this. However, when the calculations were done, the amount required was Rs 10,000 crore, he said. 
 
“The credit for implementation of OROP should not go to the government or to Narendra Modi. It should go to the poor people, the common people,” Modi added. 
 
The PM exhorted the gathering to make resolutions that benefit the people and the country and fulfil them before the 75th Independence Day in 2022. He said his dream was to ensure that all poor people get houses by that time. 
 
Earlier, Haryana CM M L Khattar told the gathering that the new airport would contribute to the development of Chandigarh, Panckhula and Mohali. He added that the state government is developing Shivalik and its adjoining areas as tourist and natural medicine destinations and the new airport would accelerate this development. 
 
Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal credited Modi for promoting co-operative federalism and said that the share states get in taxes has been increased from 32 per cent to 42 per cent.","PM Narendra Modi slams Opposition, says people won’t forgive them",News,Indian Express,2015-09-11T19:16:33Z
92a91731-0e42-45fe-a301-69f2406bcb20,"There’s the possibility a trio of South Carolina quarterbacks could all see snaps in Saturday’s game with Central Florida. The one certainty is the Gamecocks will have a third different starter in as many weeks. 

Next man up is freshman Lorenzo Nunez, the 6-foot-3, 210-pound dual-threat talent from Kennesaw, Ga., who was one of the rare positives in last week’s miserable 52-20 drubbing at Georgia. Former walk-on Perry Orth started the game in place of injured Connor Mitch before Nunez came on to provide the kind of spark coach Steve Spurrier is hoping for this week. 

Nunez has shown the ability to run in his short stints this year, especially last week when he led the team with 76 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries while completing 4 of 5 passes for 18 yards. Orth went 6 of 17 for 66 yards with an interception. With a void at receiver after star Pharoh Cooper, and starting tailback Brandon Wilds banged up and David Williams under-producing so far, Nunez' ability on the ground could prove valuable. 

“(Nunez) is different from other quarterbacks I have coached over the years, although Connor Shaw certainly was a good runner and Lorenzo is an excellent runner,” Spurrier said. “His passing we don’t know yet. At times it looks very good, but he’s going to learn where everyone is going and so forth. It’s time to let him play.” 

Nunez will become the first USC true freshman quarterback to start a game since Mikal Goodman in 1999 and the Gamecocks haven’t been led to victory by a true freshman starter since Steve Taneyhill (now head coach of Union County) in 1992. The only other true freshman quarterback starter in Spurrier’s head coaching career, which included earlier stops at Duke and Florida, was Jesse Palmer at the latter in 1997. 

“That’s just the way it has happened right now going into the fourth game of the year,” Spurrier said. 

He didn’t rule out playing Orth or redshirt freshman Michael Scarnecchia should the offense continue to sputter while giving Nunez extending playing time. As for Mitch, his throwing arm remains in a sling and Spurrier guaranteed he’d be out a minimum of several more weeks. 

“(Nunez) should play a lot this year barring injury, and still Perry and Michael need to play some also. I don’t know that we’re a one-quarterback team completely, but if (Nunez) goes out there and plays very well and takes care of the ball, we could be a one-quarterback team.”",Trio of quarterbacks could see time for USC,News,Spartanburg Herald-Journal,2015-09-26T00:35:39Z

THE Narendra Modi government might conduct a covert or special military operation to eliminate Dawood Ibrahim — one of the top wanted men by Indian law enforcement,said Union Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting,Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore,in an exclusive interview with India Today Television managing editor Rahul Kanwal. 

The former Indian army colonel and ace shooter also added that enemies of India should not take the nation lightly as India was always on the lookout to exterminate them. 

""We might conduct an operation to eliminate Dawood Ibrahim. But,its better to talk after we have achieved something. Also,it is up to the government to decide if it is to be a special operation or a covert one. If it happens to be a covert operation,we will never talk about it; if it is special we will talk,but only after it has been done,"" said Rathore. 

Asked about the dossier on Ibrahim prepared by NSA Ajit Doval,Rathore indicated India was ready to go the extra mile to bring terrorists to justice. ""We will use all means ( sam- damdanda- bheda ). We will give dossiers and do all the things necessary. But ,it will not be discussed on this table or anywhere else,"" Rathore added. 

Asked about the recently failed 
 
talks between India and Pakistan,Rathore accused Pakistan of trying to sidetrack issues. 

""The Indian government has taken a clear stand. We will talk on terror first. Only after that will we address other issues. Terror and talks cannot go hand- in - hand,"" said the minister. 

While talks had been planned at several levels,including NSA level,for interlocution over border issues and ceasefire,which are directly related to terrorism, 
 
Pakistan started inserting extraneous factors to derail talks,Rathore said. 

""Pakistan accused us of placing pre- requisites. But,while Shimal Agreement had said no to third party involvement,why did Pakistan try and involve Hurriyat? Why did they start yearning for Jammu and Kashmir?"" said Rathore. 

Rathore,while lauding his government for having resolved the vexed ‘ One- Rank- One- Pension ( OROP) issue,also hinted at the movement of ex- servicemen being stoked by political actors. 

Asked about the delay in implementation,Rathore said the intent of the government was not to conduct an exercise,but to seriously implement the OROP,which was a complicated issue. 

""For the past forty years,the previous governments had not implemented the OROP,"" Rathore said when questioned about a possible trust deficit between the government and soldiers,adding,""And if there is this gap,it is because of that very party in power at the time. 

Post the 1971 war,pensions were decreased instead of being increased. This is the only government,where the Army chief has direct access to the PM and the defence minister.""",Govt might launch covert op on Dawood,News,Yahoo! India,2015-09-07T00:00:00Z

NEW DELHI, INDIA: The second quarter of 2015 was wrought with high profile vulnerabilities and hacks. India emerged as the top targeted nation by data-stealing malware to hijack business transactions and steal information from small and medium sized businesses. 
 
Each repurposed existing malware, toolkits, and techniques to target victims from India, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, Taiwan, and the United States (US), among other countries. 
 
“In the second quarter, we saw a shift in the threat landscape with cyber criminals becoming more sophisticated and creative, amplifying existing methods of attack, and using them in new ways,” said Myla V. Pilao, Director, TrendLabs Marketing Communications, Trend Micro. 
 
“The ethereal outlook on the threat of cybercrime can no longer be held by the general population. This quarter demonstrated that the potential damage caused by cyber attacks extends far beyond a simple software bug to hacks of airplanes, smart cars and television stations.” 
 
Coupled with the fact that attack volumes are of the magnitude of hundreds of millions, the threat that cybercriminals pose today is more tangible than it has ever been. Some of the key numbers from Q2 2015 demonstrate the challenges of today’s threat landscape are: 
 Number of malware detections across APAC in Q2 2015: Over 118 million  Number of spam messages blocked across APAC: Over 396 million  Hits to malicious URLs from users across APAC: Over 214 million  Hits to malicious URLs hosted in the APAC region: Over 50 million  
Hackers are taking more strategic approaches, refining their approach and targeting more selective victims to improve their infection rates. This is reflected by the exponential increase in the use of several traditional attack methods, including a 50 percent increase in the integration of the Angler exploit kit, a 67 percent growth in overall exploit kit-related threats, and CryptoWall ransomware becoming highly targeted, with 79 percent of infections occurring in the U.S. 
 
Additionally, government entities have realized the full impact of cyberattacks during the second quarter with massive data breaches on both the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in May and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) system in June.

By Norman Lee Benjamin Riego on Sep 05, 2015 08:00 PM 
   VETERAN MOVES. Ed Daquioag and Kevin Ferrer had almost three-fourths of UST's total output.  
Heading into the 78th Season of the UAAP Men's Basketball Tournament, it was a seasoned core that University of Sto. Tomas touted would bring them back into the Final Four. 
 
The duo of Ed Daquioag and Kevin Ferrer wasted no time in proving that claim correct in combining for almost three-fourths of the Growling Tigers’ total output in their 70-64 victory versus the young Adamson University Soaring Falcons on Friday at the Araneta Coliseum. 
 
Ferrer scored 12 points as the Tigers sprinted to a 22-5 start after the first quarter. However, Adamson was able to flip the script and turned the double-digit disadvantage into only a 25-28 deficit at the half. 
 
UST managed their lead until pint-sized Joseph Nalos kept venturing into the lane and dropping shots on top of Karim Abdul to close the Falcons to 59-61 inside the last two minutes. Ferrer and Daquioag then hit back-to-back baskets which Nalos immediately got back with two shots of his own. 
 
After Daquioag again converted on an inside basket, Nalos finally failed to respond in only making one out of two free throws for a score of 67-64 still in favor of the Tigers with 17.6 on the clock. Adamson was unable to come any closer as three free throws by Louie Vigil cemented the final score. 
 
Daquioag and Ferrer posted 28 and 24 points, respectively, and were the only legitimate threats during UST’s season-opening victory. Talking about his veterans, coach Bong Dela Cruz said in his post-game conference, “They played great today and pinakita nilang nag-lead sila.” 
 
Nalos scored 18 points – all but five coming in the final frame – to give hope to the Falcons even with a loss that sent them to 0-1.

— FICO customer contact solution maintains collection rate, lowers costs and 
delivers a high-quality customer experience 
 
HIGHLIGHTS: 
– Aiful Corporation is the first company in Japan to implement FICO® 
Customer Communication Services to automate collections. 
– FICO’s customer contact solution allows Aiful to reduce the cost to 
collect and handle peak volumes without additional staff. 
– The implementation has helped improve Aiful’s cure rate – when people 
who have fallen behind in payments get back up to date and in good 
standing – to the same level as that achieved by call centre staff. 
– Customers prefer automation: Upon hearing the reason for the 
collections call, 80% of customers used the self-serve account options 
without asking to speak to an agent. 
– Consumers benefit from timely awareness of loan arrears. This allows 
them to organize alternative repayment arrangements and avoid negative 
events on their credit file.

Together with its client Aiful Corporation (TYO: 8515), one of Japan’s largest 
consumer finance companies, FICO (http://www.fico.com) (NYSE: FICO) is bringing 
significant benefits of automated, analytics-based customer engagement to 
Japan.

Aiful has implemented FICO® Customer ( 
http://www.fico.com/en/Products/DMApps/Pages/FICO-Falcon-Fraud-Manager.aspx ) 
Communication Services to improve its customers’ experience and reduce 
collection costs. The solution delivers intelligent, scalable, two-way, 
automated voice, text, e-mail and mobile app notifications, with a human touch. 
Based on these results, the Kyoto-based lender plans to extend its use of the 
solution to its subsidiaries. 
 
Shinichiro Okuyama, executive officer at Aiful, said, ""Aiful Corporation’s 
strategy is to adapt global best practices in automated debt collection to 
align with Japanese cultural and business norms. Working with FICO, we have 
been able to leverage automated contact technology to match the results that a 
human caller can achieve, yet at a lower cost, while ensuring customer 
experience is excellent and compliant with Japanese collection legislation."" 
 
FICO helped Aiful to develop legally compliant scripts for the Japanese market 
that consider regional speech patterns and social sentiments. The solution also 
incorporates tailored customer service options, such as varying promise-to-pay 
days, contact strategy and channel selection options. 
 
Aiful and FICO also designed collection strategies that optimize the blend of 
automated voice with human agents to deliver the best possible cost-to-collect, 
cure rate and customer experience. Aiful then verified the performance of these 
strategies through champion/challenger testing and used the results to create a 
new best-practice approach to collection for the Japanese market. 
 
This approach frees agents to focus on higher value work. It also ensures that 
Aiful is complying with strict regulations at all times, including during peak 
periods. 
 
As a pay-as-you-go, cloud-based platform, FICO Customer Communication Services 
is specifically designed to meet the challenges and sensitivities of debt 
collection, including the need to respond quickly to new business goals and 
regulations. 
 
Hiroshi Muramoto, country manager for FICO in Japan, said, ""By developing a 
best-practice automated collection communication system, Aiful is demonstrating 
its leadership in the industry and paving the way for a new standard of call 
center operation in Japan."" 
 
FICO® Customer Communication Services currently places more than 1.5 million 
calls globally every day, which is comparable to calling every citizen of 
Kyoto, Japan. It also sends a quarter of a million SMS messages globally every 
weekday – the equivalent of one SMS for every word in the English language.

Separatist parties are expected to win control of Catalonia's parliament in an election on Sunday, setting the region on course for a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain, which the central government says is impossible. 

Opinion polls indicate the main secessionist group Junts Pel Si, which translates to Together for Yes, and leftist party CUP are likely to fall short of 50 per cent of the vote, but would still secure a majority of seats in the 135-strong regional assembly. 

Both have said that such a result would allow them to unilaterally declare independence within 18 months. 

The Spanish centre-right government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which has opposed any attempt to hold a referendum on secession, has called the breakaway plan ""nonsense"" and vowed to block it in court. 

In Barcelona, where three quarters of the 5.5 million Catalan voters were due to cast their ballot, the mood was relaxed following a tense political campaign. 

The regional government said it expected the turnout to rise sharply from the last elections in 2012 after postal votes jumped 56 per cent. Pollsters have said that an exceptionally high turnout could spur a surprise result. 

Montse Casamitjana, a school teacher from Barcelona, said the election was a moment of truth for Catalonia. 

""We want to decide [our future' and we want to feel that we are being heard,"" she said after casting her ballot in the Pedralbes neighbourhood. 

Other voters also said they were tired of the political wrangling over secession.

While a breakaway by the wealthy northeastern autonomous region is still seen as hypothetical, even in Catalonia, analysts say the election result will bear long-lasting consequences at local and countrywide level. 

The secessionist campaign is facing a defining moment. Support for the cause has steadily waned since a peak in 2013 and any failure to achieve a majority would deal a serious blow to the movement. 

The vote may also influence the course of the Spanish general election in December. 

The main national parties, all seeking to capture more votes in Spain's second most populous region, have said they were ready to discuss with Catalonia a more favourable tax regime and increased infrastructure spending if they win.

f53c0089-26fd-456c-b4e8-39272c080ce4,"David de Gea is ""enjoying football"" and determined to re-establish himself at Manchester United after his proposed £29million move to Real Madrid collapsed on transfer deadline day. 
 
De Gea was given his first competitive outing this season in Spain's 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifier win over Macedonia, having been left out of United's squad for their first four Barclays Premier League fixtures as he was expected to complete a move to the Spanish capital club. 
 
The two clubs were unable to complete the deal in time and both United and Madrid blamed each other for the transfer failing to happen. 
 
The goalkeeper now faces a battle to regain his first-team spot at Old Trafford with incumbent Sergio Romero keeping four clean sheets in six matches in all competitions though De Gea, who was grateful for Spain coach Vicente del Bosque giving him his first outing of the campaign, has been included in the club's squad for the Champions League. 
 
""I felt well,"" he said to the Spanish press, talking about the opportunity to start for the national team. ""The coach (Vicente del Bosque) has given me confidence. 
 
""Now we need to continue to work and let's see if I'm also lucky in my club. 
 
""My future is going to be the same as it is now. I'm calm, will continue to work and improve. 
 
""In conclusion, enjoying football. I'm happy."" 
 
Juan Mata expects his United and Spain team-mate to have a smooth return to Old Trafford. 
 
""De Gea is very well regarded at the club and by the coach (Louis van Gaal),"" Mata said to Spanish sports newspaper Marca. ""I believe everything will continue to be the same. 
 
""From what I perceive, I don't think there is going to be any issue upon his return, neither from the club, the coach nor the fans."" 
   Promoted stories   
De Gea moved to United in 2011 from Atletico Madrid and has made 131 appearances for the Red Devils since. 
 
""The fans love him a lot,"" Mata said of De Gea. ""In the past two years David has been the best player in the team due to the saves he made and the many points those saves gave us. 
 
""I have no doubt that this year is also going to be very good for him."" 
 
Mata has applauded De Gea's attitude throughout a summer in which the Madrid-born player has been the centre of transfer speculation. 
 
""I've spoken to him a lot in recent days,"" Mata said. ""It has been a busy time with a lot of stress, but he is such a calm person that he has managed to maintain his focus. 
 
""Nothing changes him, he is going to continue to be the great goalkeeper he was.""

 Dear Miley Cyrus , 
Can we talk? 

Fresh from hosting the MTV VMAs in August (and inspiring interesting complaints viewers shared with the FCC), you're slated to host the debut episode of Saturday Night Live 's 41st season this weekend. Based on your last hosting stint alone, we already know this is a must-watch event. And even though we're sure you have a few treats planed for fans, we have a few requests that must be discussed. 

1. Bring Back ""The Miley Cyrus Show"" 

Remember that time you hosted SNL in 2011? You sat across from Vanessa Bayer as she imitated you during the hilarious sketch known as ""The Miley Cyrus Show."" Meanwhile, you played Justin Bieber . As Bayer's version of you might say, it was all pretty cool. 

Finally, the time has come for you and Bayer to make us crack up again. While we're at it, perhaps you can talk Jason Sudeikis into portraying your dad Billy Ray Cyrus just one more time. 

2. Deliver Your Monologue in a Turtleneck 
     
Your cover of Lana Del Rey 's ""Summertime Sadness"" is so good. We love how the turtleneck let this performance be all about the music. Perhaps you can rock the look again and deliver an epic monologue to remind everyone your comedy and acting skills are top notch. 

3. Do a Hannah Montana Skit 

Come on, Miley! Please feed our hunger for nostalgia. (Unless, of course, you and the Disney Channel have a confidential agreement to leave Hannah in the past.) 

We've already made an important casting decision for you. If Sudeikis isn't up for playing your dad, we know Taran Killam can pull off the Billy Ray charm. 
  
4. Invite Nicki Minaj 

If there's one thing we learned from the VMAs, it's that everybody loves a musical reconciliation! Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj moved past their short-lived Twitter feud with a headline-grabbing performance , and there's no better way for you and Minaj to put aside your awkward stage moment than to perform on the SNL stage together.

89706438-108d-46b2-8f65-5ab90dc812c7,"NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - 

The New Orleans Saints have restructured Drew Brees’ contract.

The Saints turned $5.2 million of Brees’ base salary into a signing bonus, according to ESPN NFL reporter Field Yates.

This creates a $2.6 million cap space, pushing his 2016 cap value to $30 million.

Brees' base salary was previously $12.435 million. By converting part of his salary into a signing bonus, the Saints can prorate it over the extent of Brees' contract - which runs through 2016.

“It's not to fit a specific player. When you have some injuries, you have some (injured reserves), you know it's creating some wiggle room. Obviously, if a player comes up, you have that space,” Sean Payton said.

Brees missed the first game of his career Sunday at Carolina due to an injury. He tested his shoulder Tuesday and is optimistic about returning this Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys at the Superdome.

Brees said the Saints approached him about the contract issue and wanted to free up some cap space. He said he was happy to help the team.

Meantime, Brees took most of the reps at practice Wednesday and says he feels good about Sunday.","Drew Brees restructures contract, 'happy to help' team",News,WTOL-TV,2015-09-30T19:16:00Z
710d85b4-d205-47cd-b674-3872b4880f76,"You can take the girl out of Brooklyn, but you can't take Brooklyn out of the girl! 

Rosie Perez was interviewed for the PBS documentary, American Masters: The Women's List , and in an exclusive outtake shared with ET, we get to see what can only be described as Rosie being Rosie. 

WATCH: Rosie Perez Recalls Same-Sex Relationship 

The 51-year-old actress recalled the time she met Barack Obama , before he became President of the United States of America. She was getting a medal from the Hispanic Congressional Caucus, and after waiting in line to meet him, Rosie stuck out her hand to say hello. But there was no need to introduce herself -- Obama knew exactly who she was. 

""He went, 'Rosie Perez!' Oh my goodness, you know who I am!"" a giddy Rosie exclaimed. ""And he goes, 'Yeah, Do the Right Thing. '"" 

Rosie's face drops when she recalls the first thing that crossed her mind when Obama mentioned the 1989 movie. ""The only thought in my head was, 'Oh my god, you've seen my t**s.' I was dying inside."" 

The New York native may have been freaking out, but she held her cool, simply smiling and nodding to the soon-to-be President. She has now been down to the White House a few times, as she was appointed to the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS in 2010, and she is just as happy to see POTUS now as she was then. 

WATCH: Charlize Theron Invited President Obama to a Strip Club! 

""In all do respect to Michelle Obama, the president is fine,"" she says. 

Even trips to Washington, D.C., can't rid Rosie of her roots, as evidenced by every greeting the former View co-host tries to give to people working in our nation's capital. 

""I'm pathetically happy. I say hello to everybody, but yet, I'm still Brooklyn, and if you don't say hello back to me, then you're going to get a little Brooklyn attitude from me… I see the White House staff members and I'm like, 'Hello? Hi! Alright, you have a good day,'"" she admits. 

Even Spike Lee witnessed that 'tude -- which is what got her cast in Do the Right Thing , after she got into an argument with the director the very first time she met him. ""He was having a butt contest to see which black woman had the biggest ass in the night club, and I found it appalling, so what I did was I jumped on the stage to make a mockery of the whole situation,"" she recalls. ""A bouncer came and took me off, and they brought me over to Spike Lee, and he said, 'This is fate.'"" 

MORE: 5 Things You Didn't Know About Rosie Perez 

After Rosie tried to brush Spike off, he explained that he wanted her to be in his movie, but she replied that she wasn't an actress. ""He said, 'Yes, you are.' This little man, Spike Lee, and he helped changed my destiny, or he helped change what I perceived that my destiny was supposed to be."" 

Fate, indeed! 

American Masters: The Women's List premieres on Friday, Sept. 25, at 9 pm ET/PT on PBS, and features 14 other trailblazers, including Madeline Albright, Margaret Cho, Alicia Keys and Shonda Rhimes.

f5f58a9d-17eb-4884-93e2-4581e4647e03,"NEW DELHI: Global jitters and plunging stock markets are beginning to worry the government, with an inter-regulatory Early Warning Group (EWG) comprising officials of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the finance ministry bracing for action should conditions worsen. 

The group, which met earlier this week to deliberate authorities' response to a further worsening of China's economic crisis and the impact of likely interest rate increase in the US, has decided to watch the situation closely for some more days while dusting up measures that can be rolled out should there be a flight of capital that can weaken the rupee and destablise the economic recovery, officials familiar with its deliberations told ET. 

The government and the RBI have for now taken heart that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have by and large shown confidence in Indian markets and there has been no large outflows from the debt markets, one official said. Net FII outflows from the debt market stood at a relatively modest Rs 650 crore in August. 

Debt markets are more sensitive to US interest rates. In August 2013, when the US Federal Reserve announced its intention to wind down asset purchases, debt funds pulled out nearly .`16,000 crore from India. The country is fundamentally stronger now, with economic growth looking up and twin deficits — fiscal and current account - relatively low and under control. 

However, officials said RBI noted at the EWG meeting that further panic in Chinese markets may worsen sentiment, and that could adversely impact Indian markets. ""The RBI has said that any impact on Indian markets is limited to sentiment issues and there have been only $232 million worth of debt outflows in August,"" said another government official, who attended this week's meeting. 

The RBI, this official said, argued that market outlook was uncertain about a possible rate hike by US Fed in September, noting that it may have a disruptive impact on global financial system, especially on emerging economies. ""Our foreign exchange reserves are a comfortable level of $355 bn and if there is any pressure on the exchange rate, the RBI has said that it will step in to defuse any volatile situation,"" said the above quoted official. 

Indian markets have walloped by global events in the past couple of weeks. The Bombay Stock Exchange's ( BSE) benchmark index Sensex touched a 13-month low on Friday, closed at 25,201 points. 

India is not alone here. Global financial markets have been in the grip of massive selling pressure amid fears over China's slowing economy and capital moving out of emerging markets in the event of a US rate increase. Keenly watched US jobs data released on Friday showed August unemployment at its lowest since April 2008, strengthening the case for a rate increase. 

The IMF has cautioned against premature monetary tightening because of the weakness in the global economy. 

India has been trying to improve confidence levels of foreign investors. ""We are taking steps both in short-term and also trying to strengthen the fundamentals of the economy in the longer run,"" one official said, noting the government's decision to accept AP Shah Committee report that sided with FIIs on the contentious issue of minimum alternate tax. 

On Thursday, the Central Board of Direct Taxes issued a circular directing its tax officials not to press ahead with demands or assessments of FIIs related to the contentious minimum alternate tax. 

Many experts believe India was likely to suffer the least if turmoil in global markets deepened as a result of monetary tightening by the US Fed later this month. 

Former RBI governor C Rangarajan told ET on Thursday that since India's growth rate is still regarded as more respectable than that of others, the impact of the rate increase in the US will be less on India. 

Sunil Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings felt there was not much that the government could do.""There are limited instruments available. They can look to improve risk management,"" he said.",Early Warning Group braces for global financial ripples,News,Economic Times,2015-09-04T22:30:37Z

Rate sensitive sectors are back in focus after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) surprised market analysts on Tuesday and cut repo rate by 50 basis points to 6.75 per cent from 7.25 earlier. Post the announcement, rate sensitive realty, auto, bankex and infrastructure stocks moved in green. 
 
The BSE Realty, BSE Bankex, BSE Auto were trading 0.83 per cent, 0.55 per cent and 0.18 per cent up at 1,352.98, 19,701.01 and 17,045.96 in the afternoon trade (at 12.25 pm). Sensex was up 0.26 per cent at 25,683.14. 
 
However, the 30-share index was down around 1 per cent at 25,373 at 10 am. BSE Bankex, BSE Auto and BSE Realty were down 1.76 per cent, 1.71 per cent and 1.18 per cent, respectively, at the same time. 
 
Jimeet Modi, chief executive officer, SAMCO Securities said, “We believe today’s policy action will significantly drive faster transmission to the end borrower, it will drive urban consumption and will drive growth in the rate sensitive sectors. We believe sectors such as housing finance, consumer lending, private banks will do well over the next few quarters. It might still take a while for the investment cycle to pick up since that is also a function of government reforms.” 
 
Murthy Nagarajan, head, fixed income, Quantum AMC, said, “Few in the market expected a 50 basis points cut in today’s policy. And it doesn’t end there, the RBIs inflation forecast of 4.75 per cent for Jan-Mar 2017 quarter suggests further room for rate cuts in CY 2016.” 
 
Here are five rate sensitive stocks on which market experts are bullish on 
 
Mahindra and Mahindra 
 Recommended By: Sharekhan 
 Why Buy: Considering the below-par monsoon for a second year in a row, Sharekhan expects the weakness in the tractor segment to persist in FY2016. Although a sharp decline in the second half of 2015-16 is not expected given the low base of last year, a meaningful recovery in the segment would be delayed to FY2017. Hence, the brokerage house has cut its tractor segment growth estimates for FY2016. 
 
In a research note, Sharekhan said, “Consequently, our earnings estimates for FY2016 and FY2017 have been lowered by 6 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively. However, given the expectation of a pick-up in the UV volumes (on the back of new launches) and a recovery in the tractor industry in FY2017, we have maintained our Buy recommendation on the Mahindra & Mahindra stock with an SOTP-based revised price target of Rs1,450 (vs Rs 1,550 earlier).” 
 
Axis Bank 
 Recommended By: Angel Broking 
Why Buy: Axis Bank’s healthy branch expansion has not only helped it maintain low cost deposits (CASA at a healthy 43%), but also improve its mix of profitable retail loans to total loan book from 20 per cent to 40 per cent. Focusing on secured retail products has aided bank to maintain relatively better asset quality with Net NPA ratio at 0.48 per cent in 1QFY2016. It is well capitalized with Tier I capital adequacy at 12 per cent positioning it strongly for growth and market share gains as GDP growth revives. On valuation front, bank is trading at 2.0x FY2017 P/ABV. 
 
Larsen & Toubro (L&T) 
 Recommended By: Angel Broking 
Why Buy: L&T’s strong bid pipeline, robust order book, coupled with comfortable deb-to-equity ratio suggest that the company will be able to attain its FY2016 order inflow and top-line guidance. Using SoTP valuation methodology, the brokerage house arrive at FY2017E price target of Rs 2,013. L&T is a proxy play for investors wanting to ride on the Indian infrastructure growth story. 
 
Ashok Leyland 
 Recommended By: Angel Broking 
Why Buy: Ashok Leyland would be direct beneficiary of medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV) upcycle from which it derives about 90 per cent of revenues. MHCV would be the fastest growing automotive segment over the next two years (Angel Broking expects 17 per cent CAGR volume growth over FY2015-2017), as the industry is likely to reach pre downcycle levels by FY2018. Strong volume growth coupled with operating leverage and reduced discounts is likely to increase profitability by 5 times for Ashok Leyland over the next two years. 
 
State Bank of India 
 Recommended By: ICICI Direct 
Why Buy: Among PSU banks, the brokerage house continue to stick to the largest bank as it is a proxy to the economy in the long term. Post capital infusion, its tier 1 ratio was at 9.6 per cent as on Q1FY16. In a research report ICICI Direct said, “We factor in credit growth in line with industry and plans to raise capital via QIP this year. Asset quality has now shown signs 
of increased pressure with stressed assets ratio (NNPA+ Std RA) at 6.5 per cent. We review our estimates and valuation and revise both lower to arrive at a target price of Rs 300 valuing the core book at 1.4x FY17E ABV and add Rs 44 for associate banks & subsidiaries (life and general insurance, AMC,etc) against Rs 374 earlier. We maintain ‘BUY’ for long term.”

Jeffrey Balch and Detective Charles Naber at the commissioners’ meeting Sept. 8. Carl Rotenberg — 21st Century Media 
 
							WEST NORRITON >> The board of commissioners unanimously approved a conditional use Sept. 8 for a proposal to build 79 single-family homes at the former Markley Farms Swim & Tennis Club off Chestnut Avenue. 
The conditional use approval included a condition that the developer, Mikelen LLC of Worcester, must prove that the revised yield plan accurately depict a lot yield of 79 lots. 

“Otherwise the lot yield for the conditional use approval shall be adjusted downward accordingly,” the condition states. 

The approval also required Mikelen to formally withdraw a previous town house application that was replaced by the single-family home plan. 

At the Aug. 11 conditional use hearing, engineer John Kolb described the plan for two loop roads off Chestnut Street and Oakland Drive. Kolb said 43 percent of the 55-acre parcel would be preserved as open space. 

Stormwater facilities will be located within the riparian corridor that includes a stream and a pond that bisects the property, Kolb said. 

Attorney Joseph Clement, representing Mikelen, said the homes would be about 2,500 square feet, four bedrooms and 2.5 baths. The homes will be slightly larger than the current homes in the surrounding neighborhood. A homeowners association will own the open space and have the responsibility for maintaining it, Kolb said. 

Township Manager Jason Bobst said at the conditional use hearing there were not enough available sewer connections “at this point” to serve the new homes. He said future improvements in the sewage treatment system would make more sewer connections available. 

In other business, Supervisory Senior Resident FBI Agent Joseph Bushner presented FBI commendations to West Norriton police Sgt. Jeffrey Balch, Detective Sgt. Michael McGettigan, Detective Charles Naber and retired Sgt. Joseph Hallman in connection with the June 2012 arrest of three armed robbery suspects. The three suspects allegedly robbed a Norristown liquor store, a Philadelphia liquor store and a Dunkin’ Donuts location in West Norriton over a two-day period, Bushner said. The three suspects were stopped by the West Norriton police as they were traveling in a vehicle, he said. 

Balch and Naber accepted their commendations at the beginning of the commissioners’ meeting.

Aussie battler Lleyton Hewitt and home hero Andy Murray exchanged the first verbal volleys of Davis Cup week on Wednesday, with each trying to pile pressure on the other ahead of their semi-final clash in Glasgow. 

Two-time Grand Slam winner Hewitt, in his final season as a player before retirement, insisted the heat was on world No 3 Murray despite having the backing of a partisan home crowd, saying: ‘A lot of the pressure is obviously on Andy. 

‘Whoever gets the opportunity to take him on day one really has nothing to lose. You can go out there, free swinging, and play your game - while Andy pretty much has to win that match in a lot of ways.

Australia's Hewitt (above right with captain Wally Masur) and Great Britain's Murray are preparing for their Davis Cup semi-final, starting on Friday 

‘It is going to be a big rubber for them, I think. And these young boys (in our team) are big-match players, as well.’ 

Great Britain star Murray, who may well play all three days in the team event starting on Friday afternoon at the Emirates Arena, returned veteran Hewitt’s opener by insisting: ‘I wouldn’t say it’s all on me. I think there’s pressure on everybody. 

‘It’s obviously Lleyton’s last chance to win the Davis Cup and he’ll be feeling pressure, as well. All of the players on his team will be feeling the same way. They have some young players that won’t have played in an atmosphere like this before, either. 

‘The pressure is on us as well because everyone views this as a good opportunity. We can point fingers at one another and say that there’s pressure for certain individuals and none on the others, but they’ll be feeling the pressure as well - and we’ll see who handles it better over the weekend.’ 
   
Hewitt says the Australian player who takes on world No 3 Murray on day one 'really has nothing to lose' 
   
Murray (second left) hit back saying the pressure was on Hewitt in his last bid to win a Davis Cup 

Bringing the event back to Glasgow, where Team GB defeated the USA earlier this year, is seen by both Andy and Jamie Murray as a huge bonus in terms of crowd support, with over 8,000 tickets for each of the three days sold out in minutes. 

‘It’s hard not to be inspired when you play in an atmosphere like we will be,’ said Andy, with Jamie adding: ‘I’m excited. The last tie in March was a lot of fun - we all had a great week and a great weekend. 

‘The crowd were great, they were so noisy - and there’s going to be even more people here this weekend so it’ll be even better. For us, we don’t get back to Scotland as much as we’d like and so the Scottish people, especially the kids, don’t get to see Andy play live very often unless it’s on TV. 

‘So I think from that point of view whenever he gets the chance to play here, it’s only a positive thing.’

Alcohol addicts are believed to be traveling alone on a long route to death. Their dependency on the drug tears them apart from almost everyone. There would be small percentage of addicts who themselves want to get rid of their habit of unlimited drinking while the majority of people with alcoholic addiction take their habit as a way of freeing themselves from the anxieties of life.  In certain cases, a family or friend has to take step to help their pal get back to a normal and clean existence. 
 
Addiction never comes by itself. There are always some unpleasant circumstances in the life of an addict that push them toward adapting a habit they feel can help them coming out of the depression or a particular state of fear. 
 
The records reveal that the majority of addiction patients suffer from anxiety, panic attacks, and emotional effects.  Unfortunately, these mental disorders causing several physical effects are hardly taken into consideration while a disease is being cured.  Since treating addiction is never that easy, it requires the proper diagnoses, moreover finding out the causes for an addict going towards the drug need to be investigated as well. 
 
People with anxiety may look normal but there’s a list of several small signs that reveal a lot about them and would no doubt be abnormal and alarming. These signs include sweaty palms, depression about social circumstances, upset sleep cycle, nail-biting, and foot tapping. People with depression feel a lot of anger and anxiety, making every day of their lives difficult. 
 
Accordingly it’s vital to address the psychological issues in order to set a treatment for the addict. Addiction caused by psychological disorder is treated with behavioral therapy and personal counseling while cognitive behavioral therapy is also taken into consideration as an important element of recovery process that helps the patient recognize, keep themselves away from, and tackle the state in which they are most likely to consume alcohol. Besides that, a motivational interview with patients is often useful to remind them of their value as a way of avoiding alcohol. Having a crucial demand of terminating an addict’s fears and anxiety with love and care, one has to showcase patience and positive behavior during the treatment process.

4f768490-7ee7-4b59-b29d-308b5dc25872,"Look at the guy pictured above. Is he  (a) a bar bouncer, (b) a retired biker, or  (c) a guy with a graduate degree from Harvard who's running for the U.S. Senate? 
 
Meet John Fetterman, mayor of the town of Braddock, Pennsylvania, and the newest candidate in the 2016 Democratic primary for Senate. He announced his candidacy Monday morning, and spent a few minutes on the phone with me. 

 
Fetterman is a bona fide colorful character, a 6-foot-8-inch mountain of a man who has a tattoo of the town's ZIP code on his left arm and the dates citizens of Braddock were murdered on his right arm. 
 
Talk to him, and he sounds like the graduate of the Kennedy School of Government he is. 
 
""My issue has always been and will continue to be confronting this mass inequality we have in our nation,"" he said. 
 
Most of Braddock's citizens are African-American and poor. Fetterman won his first primary election in 2006 by a single vote, and he went about advertising the city's cheap real estate to potential homeowners and investors and developing strategies to fight crime. 
 
""We developed an incredibly effective community policing model,"" he said. ""We went almost five and a half years without a homicide in town, while at the same time all but eliminating any kind of civilian complaints. I think that's important to mention too, in the era of Ferguson and affirming that black lives matter."" 
 
Braddock hasn't been transformed into Silicon Valley, but Fetterman has recruited some new businesses and residents, and he thinks his record shows he understands the struggles of working Pennsylvanians. 
 
His efforts have gotten national attention. He's been profiled in the New York Times and The Atlantic, and has appeared twice on ""The Colbert Report."" 
 
About that look 
 
I asked Fetterman about the challenges of running a statewide campaign. Will he put on a suit? 
 
""I won't,""  he said.  ""That's a campaign promise I intend to keep. One way or the other, the voters are going to get me, and I'm only going to be my true authentic self. I'm only going to speak the truth, and if voters appreciate it, great. If not, I would much rather let them know where I stand."" 
 
His look, he said, ""is not part of some shtick. It's pretty simple. It's just what works out here, and I couldn't relate to anybody if I was trying to wear a suit and tie every day."" 
 
The bald head he added, isn't an affect. ""It's just acknowledging the genetics that are working against me,"" he said. 
 
Can he compete? 

Fetterman has an appealing pitch and is sure to get some media buzz. He reminds you of Jesse Ventura, the pro wrestler who was elected governor of Minnesota in 1998. 
 
But there are some hard realities of running in Pennsylvania. It's a huge state, and while getting the attention of journalists is nice, it's not enough. To become known by enough voters quickly, you usually need millions of bucks worth of TV ads. 
 
Conventional wisdom says it will be hard for an unknown like Fetterman to run with the two formidable candidates already in the race -- former Delaware County Congressman Joe Sestak and Katie McGinty, until recently Gov. Tom Wolf's chief of staff. 
 
Both have run statewide races in Pennsylvania. Sestak beat Arlen Specter in the 2010 Democratic primary, then lost to incumbent Republican Pat Toomey in the general. McGinty ran in last year's Democratic gubernatorial primary. 
 
It's interesting, though, that Fetterman is getting help from Bill Hyers, who managed the winning campaigns of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. 
 
I spoke with Hyers, who says he's working with Fetterman for free for now. They were introduced by Pat Millham, a western Pennsylvania political consultant who worked with Hyers on the Obama campaign. 
 
Hyers, said yes, it will take money to win, but if you look at the presidential race you'll see candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Ben Carson that have managed to pull in some serious cash without a base of traditional political donors or a conventional fundraising effort. 
 
And you could imagine Fetterman leveraging some of his national connections into contributions. Who knows? He's getting in early enough to build something that might connect with small and medium donors. And in a multi-candidate field, funny things can happen. 
 
Fetterman will be in Philadelphia Wednesday to raise a little money and meet the local media. They'll have no choice but to look up to him.",New face in the Democratic Senate field in Pa.,News,News Works,2015-09-14T18:52:56Z

For 38 years, Denise Saunders has been able to run to Bob's Food Store in Garnavillo to pick up that last minute item she needs for dinner.

But now, she'll have to plan ahead, she says, because Bob's Food Store is closing it's doors.

""It's beyond words. It almost makes me want to cry,"" she said.

Bob Bente, who opened the business in 1977, says a new rule that requires him to get a certification to retain his license is part of the reason he's closing the business. ""I'm 74 years old, and I don't want to go back to school,"" he said.

He's also had trouble finding people to work in his store.

Regardless of the reason, he's disappointed his run is coming to an end.

""And as time went on, now it just seems like a let down, you know, the bottom fell out and it's over with, you know?""

One of Bob's biggest concerns now is how Garnavillo's older population will get their groceries.

""It's gonna be a real problem. We have a lot of older people that live here and some of them are forbidden to drive very far,"" he said. The nearest store, he says, is about a 15 minute drive away.

Any concerns that he wouldn't sell the rest of his product have been alleviated this week, as he says his business has been more than steady the past few days.

""We've cleaned these store shelves off the past three or four days.""

And his future?

As I sat on the sofa last week watching Scotland try in vain to peg back Germany for a third time, I was left scratching my head in bewilderment at the fact Steven Naismith had remained on the bench for the entire game. 

A player who scores goals, with regularity, against the best sides the Premier League has to offer was not the man Gordon Strachan turned to in his hour of need. 

Instead, the Scottish manager looked to Derby County striker Chris Martin – yet to find the net in an international match – to salvage what could have been a crucial point against the world champions. Baffling. 

But then, in fairness to wee Gordon, I’d be lying if I said I was in agreement with Roberto Martinez’s ultimately game-defining decision to introduce the Scot in place of the injured Muhamed Besic less than ten minutes into Saturday’s clash with Chelsea. 

Just to clarify, that’s not because I don’t rate Naismith. Far from it. 

I feared it was a substitution that screamed square peg in a round hole. It wouldn’t have been the first time that Naismith has been the victim of his ability ‘to do a job’, even if it wasn’t in a position where he could truly excel. 

But then there had been raised eyebrows even before a ball had been kicked. No wingers on the pitch and Besic out on the left – in hindsight, the real square peg. 

It seemed to me, for all nine minutes he was on the pitch, that the Bosnian international’s purpose was to afford Brendan Galloway the protection he so desperately lacked against Manchester City in the previous home game. 

Ironically, Naismith had been brought on in the same match to perform a similar role, with limited success, because Tyias Browning – on for the injured Galloway – was being continually left exposed against the speed and trickery of Jesus Navas, supported by Bacary Sagna and the roaming David Silva. 

The fact the substitution hadn’t worked and left Naismith virtually redundant as an attacking threat as we huffed and puffed for an equaliser, was firmly in my mind as number 14 appeared on the fourth official’s electronic board at the weekend. 

It’s great to be wrong sometimes isn’t it? A frightened Chelsea backline and a confident, energetic Galloway meant that Naismith wasn’t bogged down with defensive duties. 

He could roam, he could find pockets of space, he could hurt Chelsea once more. And how. 

Naismith again proved he’s the most clinical finisher at the club. 

But do you know what I like the most about him? There’s nothing complicated about his game. Nothing flash, nothing u…",Everton FC's Naismith proves football doesn't have to be complicated to be effective,News,MyInforms,2015-09-15T17:06:14Z

The hard disk was earlier found to have gone corrupt. 
 
Several persons are visible in the CCTV grabs and only the victims can identify whether any of them had allegedly sexually assaulted them, said a police official. 
 
However, the victims left the country on September 10, only after Gurgaon Police reportedly said that they were not needed to be physically present here for the probe. 
 
The DVR was yesterday sent to the state's only Forensic Science Laboratory in Madhubani, where the Haryana Police Academy is located, said a senior official. 
 
Police had taken the DVR into its custody when they rescued the two Nepalese girls and handed it over to a special team, working on retrieving data crucial to the case. 
 
The team, however, failed to do so despite putting efforts for several hours, as the hard disk turned out to be corrupt. 
 
Later, the task was assigned to a private enterprise. When the private enterprise failed, the cops opted for the Madhubani FSL. 
 
The DVR was connected to around six functional CCTV cameras which covered the entry, exit and other crucial spots outside the diplomat's apartment. 
 
The police was to prepare a report after monitoring the CCTV footage and share it with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), if the ministry had asked for it, the official added.

fe436b3f-1a8f-42f7-8f2a-2a8f2c60fea4,"Its last meal wasn't pleasant. 

A mouse tail was lodged in its throat when it died. Semi-digested flesh and fur still remained in its stomach when it was wrapped in mummy bandages. 

A new autopsy reveals that overeating choked and killed this unfortunate raptor from ancient Egypt. Scientists suspect that Egyptians force-fed the bird so they could offer it to the sun god Ra as a votive mummy. 

Mummification wasn't reserved for people in Egypt. The archaeological record is full of examples of cats, dogs, crocodiles and birds that were mummified and used as religious offerings to their corresponding animal gods, a practice that was popular from about 600 B.C. until around A.D. 250, well into the Roman period. Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo, has made a living studying these animal mummies, and for her latest research, she examined the ancient remains of a European kestrel from the Iziko Museums of South Africa in Cape Town. [See Photos of Dog Mummies in Ancient Egyptian Catacomb] 

New imaging technologies have made it possible to see through mummies without butchering ancient corpses: Ikram and her colleagues used an X-ray computed tomography scanner at Stellenbosch University in South Africa to see the insides of the kestrel in 3D. The images revealed the bird's stomach was stuffed with bones and teeth from at least two mice —one with its tail inside the raptor's esophagus —and a partially digested sparrow. 

The kestrel's skeleton showed no signs of trauma. And whereas other bird mummies in Egypt had their gizzards removed or their beaks packed with food after death, this specimen also had no signs of evisceration. The kestrel was likely desiccated with natron (a naturally occurring soda ash) embalmed with resin and wrapped in bandages (in this case, quite haphazardly) with its stomach contents intact. 

""We were extraordinarily surprised by the virtual autopsy as we had no expectation of any contents within the kestrel's body,"" Ikram said. ""To learn that it choked was amazing."" 

Ikram and her colleagues say it's unlikely the kestrel accidentally or deliberately ate itself to death, as the birds are known to store food when they catch too much for a single meal. Rather, the bird likely had lots of help dying from its captors. 

In Egyptian art, images show a variety of animals, from hyenas to geese, being force-fed by people, Ikram told Live Science. But this is the first time archaeologists have identified an animal mummy that died of overeating. The kestrel in the Iziko Museums might also be among the earliest evidence of falconry. 

""The fact that wild birds that were not of use for food themselves were tamed and controlled provides an insight into Egyptian religious practices,"" Ikram said. ""The ability of the Egyptians to tame and control wild bird populations, and the possible use of these creatures in falconry, either as sport or in obtaining small game, is of interest as it documents the evolving relationship between humans and animals."" 

The mummy arrived at the Iziko Museums in the early 20th century, but unfortunately the authors of the study don't know where it came from. Ikram thinks it likely was unearthed in a catacomb or special burial linked with the sun god. Her team is going through the museum archives to try to trace the artifact to a specific geographic area.

An online report in the Miami Herald newspaper says 60-year-old Pamella Watson, who has been detained since her arrest in May, was convicted of a single wire-fraud offense in a plea agreement filed in Fort Lauderdale federal court. 
 
The report says she faces up to 20 years in prison when she returns to court on December four for sentencing by US District Judge James Cohn. 
 
Meanwhile, a slew of other charges, from filing fictitious tax returns to laundering ill-gotten refunds, will be dropped as part of the deal with the US attorney’s office. 
  Jovan Johnson reports   
The Miami Herald reports that court records say the Jamaican woman exploited hundreds of unwitting clients, many of whom are members of Jamaica's Diaspora in South Florida. 
 
It's reported she changed her clients' actual tax returns and filed inflated refund claims without their knowledge. 
 
Watson deceived the US tax authorities by keeping US$3.4 million in “excessive” tax refunds for herself and giving the clients their actual refunds between 2011 and 2014. 
 
It's reported that she avoided detection by splitting the refund deposits into bank accounts that she controlled through her tax preparation business. 
 
Watson, who is a naturalised US citizen, worked as a certified public accountant at her tax preparation office in Miami and lived in Davie. 
 
The Miami Herald said she has hosted fundraisers for leaders of both political parties. 
 
Watson was involved in numerous South Florida organisations and served on several boards, including the Jamaican Women of South Florida. 
 
As part of her plea agreement, Watson has agreed to repay the US' Internal Revenue Service. 
 
Following her arrest in May, the board of directors of the Jamaican Women of Florida, Inc. voted to suspend Watson who was elected earlier as treasurer of the group.",Jamaican allegedly connected to local politicians pleads guilty to tax fraud in US,News,Jamaica Gleaner,2015-09-25T17:06:20Z

Researchers at security company ESET have found a type of malware that changes an Android device's PIN, the first of its kind in an ever-evolving landscape of ransomware attacks. 

For most users, the only option to get rid of the malware is to reset the phone to its factory settings, which unfortunately also deletes all the data on the device. 

The malware calls itself ""Porn Droid"" and bills itself as a viewer for adult content. It has only been seen on third-party Android application marketplaces or forums for pirated software, wrote Lukas Stefanko, an ESET malware analyst. 

But after it's installed, users see a warning supposedly from the FBI that they've allegedly viewed ""prohibited pornography."" It asks for a US$500 fine to be paid within three days. 

To change the device's PIN, Porn Droid needs administrator-level access to the phone.  Stefanko wrote that the malware uses a new method to obtain that high level of access. 

When Porn Droid runs, it asks people to click a button to activate the viewer app. But beneath that window, and obscured by it, is another button for setting device administer privileges. 

ESET 

Porn Droid tricks a user into granting admin access through deceptive windows. 

""After clicking on the button, the user's device is doomed,"" Stefanko wrote. ""The Trojan app has obtained administrator rights and now can lock the device. And even worse, it sets a new PIN for the lock screen."" 

Other kinds of Android malware locked the screen by keeping the ransonware warning in the foreground using an infinite loop. But that could be remedied by using a command-line tool, the Android debug bridge, or deactivating admin rights in Safe Mode, according to Stefanko. 

In the case of Porn Droid, if someone tries to deactivate the admin privileges, the malware uses a call-back function to reactivate them, Stefanko wrote. 

The malware is also coded to try to shut down three mobile antivirus products: Dr. Web, ESET's Mobile Security and Avast.  

More advanced users may be able to get rid of Porn Droid without resetting and erasing all data on their phone. It is possible to remove the malware if a user has root privileges to the device, and some security software can stop it, Stefanko wrote. 

Ransomware attacks, both desktop and mobile, have become some of the most persistent and damaging scams on the Internet. One of the most prevalent scams is encrypting a person's files and asking for money for the files to be decrypted. 

Security experts generally advise not paying the ransom, as in many cases fraudsters never bother to fix the victim's computer.",Android ransomware changes a device's PIN code,News,Computerworld UK,2015-09-11T06:04:39Z

Trump's appearance on Stephen Colbert's ""Late Show"" Tuesday night gave the show its best viewership since its debut on Sept. 8. 

Colbert's sit down with the outspoken presidential candidate brought in 4.6 million viewers. That was the biggest ""Late Show"" audience since the 6.6 million that watched on Colbert's opening night. 

This number crushed competition Tuesday night including Colbert's biggest rival Jimmy Fallon and ""The Tonight Show,"" which pulled in 3.3 million viewers. 

Fallon's guests on Tuesday were Anne Hathaway and Anthony Anderson. Fallon also premiered a new digital original, ""Jimpire,"" a spoof of the popular Fox hit show ""Empire."" 

In terms of the prized advertising demographic of viewers aged 18 to 49 years old, Colbert tied Fallon 1.0 to 1.0. 

Colbert's Trump boost comes a little over a week after Fallon saw a ""Trump bump"" of his own. Trump's appearance on September 11 helped Fallon beat Colbert bringing in an impressive 4.5 million viewers. 

Trump and Colbert had a spirited conversation Tuesday night that touched on topics like Trump's plans for immigration and his thoughts on the Iran nuclear deal. 

Colbert served up what he called a ""big fat meatball"" of a question, asking Trump, ""Barack Obama, born in the United States?"" 

Trump dodged the question saying, ""I don't talk about it anymore,"" before moving on to other issues.

5e769d9b-d3d3-4e87-a634-3cb91c8ddd00,"The United Nations' humanitarian chief says that UN agencies have been ordered out of the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine by the ""de facto authorities"" there.

Stephen O'Brien said he was ""alarmed"" that Russian-backed Ukrainian separatists ordered UN agencies and several civil health organizations to end operations and leave by this weekend, and called on the separatists to reconsider.

As a result of the separatists' actions, including a new requirement since July that groups register before they can operate in eastern Ukraine, some 16,000 tons of humanitarian aid has not been delivered and local hospitals have not been able to perform surgery because they lack anesthesia, he said.

UN operations in the region of Donetsk, the other major separatist-held city in eastern Ukraine, are also in peril, he said. ""A decision by the de facto authorities in Donetsk on the UN's future operations remains on hold, and all UN agency operations have been suspended,"" he said.

""Some 150,000 people are not receiving monthly food distributions,"" O'Brien said. The suspension of shipments is putting lives at risk and is ""having a serious impact on some 3 million people as winter approaches,"" he said.

O'Brien called the failure of authorities in the separatist-held regions to allow humanitarian access ""a blatant violation of international humanitarian law.""

Several international nongovernmental organizations also have been told to leave Luhansk by September 26, he said.

Separatist leaders said on September 24 that they banned 10 Western health relief groups for ""grave violations"" of local laws.

The list includes such world-renowned organizations as Doctors Without Borders and the Czech Republic's People in Need.

But they spared the operations of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which was targeted earlier this month for allegedly breaching fire-safety laws.

""We received 11 accreditation applications. Ten of them were rejected for various reasons,"" the Luhansk government's deputy leader, Vasily Nikitin, said in a statement on the insurgents' official news site.

""With much regret, I must say that People in Need -- they too gravely violated our conditions.""

The Luhansk guerrillas last week had accused the doctors group of ""illegally storing psychotropic medication"" that lacked proper registration in either Russia or Ukraine.

Doctors Without Borders strongly denied the allegations. On September 24, the group said it was ""extremely concerned"" about the separatists' actions and it had closed its office in Luhansk.

Nikitin said the outlawed groups had the right to file new applications or even request ones by telephone if they wish to stay.

The UN's O'Brien called on the separatists ""in both Luhansk and Donetsk to ensure the immediate resumption of UN and international NGO activities.""

Appealing to Russia, O'Brien urged ""everyone with influence over the de facto authorities to use that influence to ensure the immediate resumption of humanitarian aid by UN agencies and international NGOs.""

Meanwhile a three-week programme of roadworks has been announced on the Exeter side of the Penn Inn roundabout. 

Temporary lane restrictions and off-peak overnight road closures will be in force, and motorists may experience delays. 
 
The work will include kerb laying, surveying, pavement investigation, signage installation, as well as works on existing gullies, tree-planting and landscaping. 

A spokesman from GallifordTry, which is building the new bypass, said:  ""When planning the works we have consulted South West Highways, who are managing the Teign Viaduct project, and where possible we have co-ordinated our work to minimise disruption to road users. 

""During this time we will also be working on the south side of the flyover, which will require some lane restrictions. 

""At the southern end of the project, the new junction at Edginswell is scheduled to be completed later in the autumn, after which you will be able to travel on the new A380 South Devon Highway all the way from Hamelin Way to Penn Inn and beyond. 

""After the road opens, the project will continue into 2016 with secondary works and landscaping to complete."" 

Until Friday there will be a 24-hour restriction down to one lane only heading towards Newton Abbot from Ware Barton to Penn Inn.  Delays are expected. 

Until Friday between 7pm and 7am there will be a north and southbound road closure of the A380 between Telegraph Hill and Penn Inn managed by South West Highways, not associated with the South Devon Link Road.

Until recently, the reason WHY red meat causes cancer hasn’t been understood. But this breakthrough changes everything…  
 
Many people grew up being urged to eat pork, beef, and dairy products for their health , but in recent years have received advice to cut back on animal products – especially red meat.  
 
According to a number of studies, the consumption of red meat is linked with increased risk for cancer(s), atherosclerosis (heart disease), stroke, Alzheimer’s , and even Type II Diabetes…  But until now, researchers have not exactly understood  why . 
 
As  The Telegraph reports , scientists from the University of California in San Diego believe it mainly  has to do with sugar.  
 
While humans, as omnivores, can tolerate eating meat (and have been doing so for many years, but not in the quantity witnessed today) there is unique sugar named Neu5Gc, found in most mammals but not in humans, that triggers an immune response which causes inflammation. 
 
Mice were used for the study which found that all the evidence linking Neu5Gc to cancer was circumstantial or indirectly predicted from experimental setups . According to the scientists, this is the first time they mimicked the exact situation in humans through feeding non-human Neu5Gc and inducing anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. This increased spontaneous cancer in mice.

Suspect arrested in shooting of Taunton teen at Hopewell Park 

A Taunton teenager was shot at least three times in front of Hopewell Park Tuesday afternoon, police said. 

Comment 

Taunton Gazette Staff Reporter 

Taunton Gazette Staff Reporter 

TAUNTON — Police have made an arrest in connection to the shooting and wounding of a Taunton teenager in front of Hopewell Park on Tuesday afternoon. 

Police said the 16-year-old male suspect is charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, armed robbery and carrying a gun without a firearms identification card. 

He is being held at Taunton Police Station lockup on $500,000 bail pending arraignment, according to Detective Capt. John Reardon. 

Reardon said police found the suspect one block away from the shooting inside his residence — an apartment at the intersection of Dartmouth and Hamilton streets. 

Two older men who were with the suspect were not arrested, Reardon said. 

The victim was shot at least three times at around 1 p.m., police said. 

The 17-year-old had been walking with his girlfriend past the park on lower Hamilton Street near Exeter Street when they were accosted by a male with a gun, police said. 

Police collected four small-caliber shell casings from the street but did not immediately recover the gun or locate the shooter. 

The victim was later flown by helicopter — which touched down on adjacent Ron Arieta football field, used by Coyle and Cassidy High School — to either a Boston or Rhode Island hospital, authorities said. 

A few minutes after the shooting, two men in a BMW sedan were detained when they were stopped by police as they drove on nearby Dartmouth Street toward Broadway/Route 138. 

Chief Edward Walsh said police do not suspect those two individuals of being involved in the shooting. 

Authorities say a lock-down was enforced at nearby Coyle and Cassidy. Students were instructed to not leave their classes until notified, and weren’t released until after their school day normally ended, according to one student. 

Victim treated at crime scene 

Taunton firefighter Jay Lawrence said he arrived on scene just as fire-prevention inspectors Sam Delgado and Giuseppe Grasso were working on the injured teen. 

Lawrence said the victim was hit at least three times — in the thigh, below the rib cage and in the scalp area of his head. 

The most serious wound, he said, was the leg shot, which he said caused what appeared to be internal bleeding. 

Lawrence said the leg had turned blue and was swollen, but he added that he thought the victim, who was conscious and talking, would survive. 

He also the weapon was probably not a large-caliber handgun: “The holes were small,” Lawrence said. 

Lawrence said there was significant bleeding from the surface of the man’s head. 

He said the teen’s girlfriend tried to help by holding a towel to his scalp, which had been creased by a bullet. 

“He’s lucky that the guy who shot him had horrible aim,” Lawrence said. “Hopefully they’ll catch him.” 

Marilyn Greene, commissioner of the city’s Parks, Cemeteries and Public Grounds Department, credited her general foreman for trying to assist the victim. 

Greene said the worker, whom she declined to identify, had been in the park with a small crew cutting grass. 

She said the man ran to the wounded boy, took off his own shirt and used it to apply pressure to stanch the flow of blood. 

Greene said she was upset that someone had been shot not far from Coyle and Cassidy, a Catholic high school that now also has a middle school division. 

“This is too close to a school and a playground. It’s too close,” she said. 

Greene said the police have two video surveillance cameras set up in the park, but she said it’s uncertain whether either of them caught the action as it unfolded. 

Another one of Greene’s employees, who declined to give his name, said the high-pitched sound of the gunshots convinced him that the gun used was of a small caliber. 

A member of the Plymouth County Sheriff’s Office collected forensic evidence at the crime scene. 

‘We have a lot of problems here’ 

Maria Perreira, 73, said she was at her home nearby on Exeter Street, reading a novel, when she heard three gunshots ring out. Perreira said she walked to the street corner and saw a teenage boy on the ground wounded, groaning from pain. Perreira said she got a towel and water from her house to clean blood that was all over the girlfriend who accompanied the victim. 

Perreira said she was disturbed by the situation, but said she wasn’t surprised. 

“No, because we have a lot of problems here,” said Perreira, who was calm, but said the violence is very concerning. “I don’t like it. You don’t feel safe. But there’s nothing I can do.” 

Perreira said she saw a backpack on the ground next to the victim. 

“I feel bad for the kid,” Perreira said. “I said a prayer for him.” 

John Barros, who lives around the corner at 12 Dartmouth St., said he’d just come home after picking up his 11-year-old daughter at her bus stop when he heard the gunfire. 

“This is bad, very bad,” Barros said. 

Kathy Perry, who also lives on Dartmouth Street, said she was in her kitchen when she heard a volley of four or five shots, followed by “a bunch of yelling in the park.” 

Her husband, Robert, said he then saw two men, one of whom was carrying an object in a red towel or shirt, jump into the BMW and speed up the block toward Broadway until they were blocked by a police cruiser. 

“Right in broad daylight too — people have no shame,” Perry said. 

Taunton Police Chief Edward Walsh said the incident, at first glance, “appears to have been drug-related. But we’ll find out in time.” 

Taunton Mayor Thomas Hoye said the city will not tolerate such violence. 

“I’m confident that the police will make an arrest and these thugs will not take over our neighborhoods,” said Hoye, who looked on as investigators scoured Hamilton Street and the young victim was transported. 

Third shooting in four months 

In July, two men were shot and injured — one of whom took a bullet to the head and has since been released from the hospital — on railroad tracks off of Hart Street near Plain Street. 

No one yet has been charged in that shooting. 

In June, one man was killed and three others injured when gunfire erupted in the early evening in front of a Weir Street house. Police did make an arrest in that case. 

Francis Anthony Melchionne said he rushed over from his Taunton house when news of the Hopewell Park shooting broke. 

Melchionne, 57, said he established the Brockton chapter of the Guardian Angels 11 years ago. The Guardian Angels is a volunteer anti-crime, neighborhood-patrol organization. 

Melchionne said he formed a Taunton chapter, which including himself now has six members, about a month ago and has so far conducted two patrols in the city. 

“We’ll be doing a patrol in this area, so we need to know what’s going on,” he said. 

Lock-down at Coyle and Cassidy 

Joshua Ashbury, a student at Coyle and Cassidy, said his school required all students to stay in place in the room they were in when the shooting broke out, around 1 p.m. The scene of the shooting, Hopewell Park, neighbors Coyle Cassidy High School and Middle School Division, a Catholic school in the city for grades six through 12.",Suspect arrested in shooting of Taunton teen at Hopewell Park,News,Taunton Gazette,2015-09-29T23:25:35Z
1728611d-16c8-450d-82d9-678fe11205df,"Accra, Sept 22, GNA - Zenith Bank Ghana has held a thanks-giving service in Accra as part of the celebration of its 10th year anniversary.

Delivering a sermon, Bishop James Saah of the Action Chapel, said the grace of the Almighty God had sustained the Bank and the thanksgiving ceremony was very appropriate.

He urged the leadership of the Bank to hold such programmes every year, adding that it was only God who could save a leader from taking bad decisions.

Mr Daniel Asiedu, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Zenith Bank, said the decade of successful operations was through the help of God, hence the service to show appreciation.

He said the Bank which started in 2005 with 45 staff, could now boast of 663 highly skilled staff, with 200,000 individual and corporate entities as customers, and 30 business locations nationwide.

He said the Bank had cut the sod for the construction of a new ultra-modern office as its headquarters.

'We have over the years won many local and international awards which is as a result of our excellent performance and it include the prestigious bank of the year award in 2014, and the one also given to us by the Word Finance Magazine,' he said.

Mr Asiedu said the Bank was determined to accomplish more by improving productivity and operational efficiency, adding that it would continue to introduce more innovative products for its cherished customers.

Mrs Chinnery Hesse, Founding Board member of the Bank, commended the staff for working hard to make it a reference point for the provision of flawless and prompt banking services.

She disclosed that the total assets of the bank had grown from 64.7 million Ghana Cedis in 2006 to three billion Ghana Cedis as at the end of 2014, with 4,843 per cent in shareholder growth.

'Our rapid growth is attributable to the strong corporate governance, astute management and formidable employees and customers,' she said.

Mrs Hesse said since good works could never be exhausted, management would not rest on its oars, but would work to entrench its position as one of the leading banks in the country.

As part of the celebration, awards were given to deserving long serving staff of the Bank.

We have local volunteers, Coastguard, a Police Dog and our Police Helicopter searching for him and will continue the ground search even after the helicopter has left.

We ask of you this. If you are living or staying in Tresco can you please take the trouble to search your sheds, out buildings, lean too's, greenhouses, etc. if your neighbour is elderly please can you do this on their behalf.

Police and firefighters responded to an accident about 6:10 p.m. Friday on Chapel Street. A 16-year-old Canton High School student was reversing a Jeep Commander out of his family’s driveway when he lost control, police said. The vehicle hit the fence in front of his family’s home, then spun out of control, coming to a rest against a neighbor’s house, police said. Two of the residents were home at the time, but were not injured. “It appears right now that the vehicle was in reverse and he was possibly trying to gain control of the vehicle and his door was still open,” Canton Police Chief Ken Berkowitz said. The teenager, who police did not identify, was partially ejected from the Jeep, which then rolled over him. The boy ended up pinned on the ground between the car and the house. “It appears that he may have been run over by his own vehicle,” Berkowitz said. Firefighters initially called for a medical helicopter, but decided to rush the teenager to Norwood Hospital because he suffered serious injuries, police said. On Chapel Street, as Canton police and state police investigators took photographs at the scene Friday evening, one of the teen’s flip flops sat in the road. Canton police confirmed on Saturday morning that the teenager died. Grief counselors are available at Canton High School for students coping with the loss of a classmate.

b5bec2a7-0224-4592-b179-8ac286ad9812,"(CNN) -  
Over the years, resveratrol, an antioxidant found in grapes, chocolate and red wine, has been touted as a possible antidote to Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes and many other conditions. Now, the first study in people with Alzheimer's suggests that the compound, when taken in concentrated doses, may actually have benefit in slowing progression of this disease. 
 
Researchers at 21 medical centers across the United States looked at the safety and effectiveness of taking high doses of resveratrol in an experimental pill -- equal to the amount found in 1,000 bottles of red wine -- in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's. 

The researchers looked at several biomarkers of Alzheimer's, and found that people who took up to four pills a day for a year had higher levels of amyloid-beta proteins in their spinal fluid than those who took a placebo (control) pill. 

Although accumulation of amyloid-beta in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, patients actually have lower levels of this protein outside of the brain. The study finding suggests that resveratrol could help change the balance from amyloid-beta buildup in the brain to circulating protein in the body. 

Even if concentrated forms of resveratrol pills like the kind used in this study were available, it's too soon to recommend going out and getting some just yet. 

""The study is encouraging enough that we should certainly go ahead and do a [larger] clinical trial because we showed that it is safe and does have significant effects on Alzheimer's biomarkers,"" said Dr. R. Scott Turner, professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center and lead investigator of the study, which was published on Friday in the journal Neurology. 

The main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. The only small concern they found was that patients taking resveratrol lost about two pounds during the one-year study, and weight loss is already a problem with Alzheimer's, Turner said. In comparison, the control group gained about 1 pound. 

Much more research is needed 

The study was not big enough to answer some important questions, such as whether patients taking resveratrol actually had lower levels of amyloid-beta plaques in their brain, and most importantly, whether they experienced less decline in their mental faculties. 

A large, phase 3 clinical trial getting at these issues could start in as soon as a year, Turner said. (The current study was a phase 2 trial, typically meant to evaluate safety and get an early look at efficacy of a new drug.) 

Even for the relatively small number of participants in the study, the researchers did see indication that resveratrol could improve cognition. Patients in this group had slight improvements in their ability to carry out daily tasks, such as remembering to brush their teeth. And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. (Neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was taking resveratrol and who was taking placebo.) 

""To really get a better feel of how effective this could be you really need to do larger studies for longer periods of time (such as several years),"" said James A. Hendrix, director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer's Association, a research and advocacy organization. ""Other potential therapies we've had had some early exciting results and then they didn't pan out in later trials,"" he added. 

If resveratrol does pan out in further research, it may add to the medications that are currently available, such as Aricept and Exelon, which slow, but do not halt, progression of the disease, Hendrix said. 

Ultimately, it will probably be a combination of several drugs, as well as diet, exercise and social and mental stimulation that help stave off the rapid mental decline that is often associated with Alzheimer's, he added. 

Antioxidant may be most effective in combination 

This is one of the first studies to look not only at these biomarkers, but also the metabolites of resveratrol in spinal fluid, to show that resveratrol is probably getting into the brain, said Dr. Giulio M. Pasinetti, who is the Saunders Family Chair and professor in neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address. 

In addition, resveratrol on its own might not end up working as well as a combination of resveratrol and other polyphenol compounds found in red wine, grape juice and grape seed extract, which could help people at risk of Alzheimer's and those who already have mild symptoms, Pasinetti said. 

The current study used high doses of resveratrol to increase the chances that enough of the compound got into the brain to have an effect. But for now, the best way to get resveratrol is probably through diet. One glass of red wine a day could help those with mild Alzheimer's, ""but no more than that,"" Turner said. 

There is probably little benefit in taking currently available resveratrol supplements, even if they claim to contain levels similar to the ones used in this study. ""The things that are on the market are not regulated, and you don't know how much is in them,"" Turner said. ""There could be 500 milligrams, which is what they advertise [researchers gave participants in the study four 500 milligram pills a day] or there could be zero,"" he said. 

Previous research has suggested that people who consume diets rich in resveratrol do not have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and other conditions.","For Alzheimer's, resveratrol brings hope",News,Channel 3000,2015-09-12T08:23:18Z

The artist clearly makes spending time with her hubby Mike Fisher a priority, however — she posted this adorable photo of the couple in the car on a date night together on Sept. 17, looking pumped for some grown-up conversation without the added bonus of spit-up. 
 
Underwood is looking beautiful as ever, sporting a dreamy side-braid that would make Princess Elsa jealous and wearing a bold floral pattern. Fisher is dressed handsomely in a nice button-up, ready for a night on the town. 
 
The “Smoke Break” singer has been keeping busy since her return to the spotlight after the birth of her son Isaiah in February, most recently promoting the new single on the Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon .

88d9245e-4ed4-4372-8c43-3492be684fdf,"David Cameron has urged Britain to give a ""warm welcome"" to Syrian refugees, as he visited some of those who will benefit from his decision to take in 20,000 of the most vulnerable people from camps in the region. 
 
		 
The Prime Minister met families living in the bleak surroundings of the Dalhamiyet Zahle camp less than a mile from the Syrian border in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, where 525 Syrians - including many children - are crowded into 90 tents laid out in ranks behind a breeze-block wall. 
  David Cameron meets Syrian refugee families at a tented settlement camp in the Bekaa Valley on the Syrian - Lebanese border.   
He was invited into the tent of a mother-of-10, who told him how she struggled to feed her family on reduced handouts of 13.50 US dollars (£8.75) a month after the World Food Programme was forced to cut back support. 

			 
Mr Cameron announced that he was appointing Watford MP Richard Harrington as Minister for Syrian Refugees to oversee the operation to welcome the new arrivals to the UK over the next five years. 



 
The Prime Minister has resisted pressure to join an EU scheme to resettle around the continent some 160,000 migrants who have made perilous journeys across the Mediterranean to Europe. 

He stressed that Britain was the second largest bilateral donor of aid to displaced people in Syria and surrounding countries, with the £100 million of help he announced earlier this month bringing the UK's total contribution over three years to more than £1 billion. Some 97% of people forced out of their homes by Syria's civil war are still in the region, he said. 

""I want to focus on how we help Syrian refugees here in Lebanon, in Jordan, how we make sure we discourage people from making this dangerous journey to Europe but instead we take people from these camps and we make them welcome in the United Kingdom, in our country,"" said Mr Cameron. 

""We make sure there are homes for them to go to, schools for their children, a warm welcome in Britain."" 

			 
Mr Cameron said he wanted the offer of sanctuary to 20,000 Syrians to be ""something the whole country can be proud of"". 

The PM held talks with his Lebanese counterpart, Tammam Salam, who thanked him for Britain's ""sustained decisive backing"" for his country, which has taken 1.1 million Syrians - more than a quarter of Lebanon's population. 

Some £29 million of the latest UK donation is going to Lebanon, with £60 million going to agencies and charities helping people in Syria itself, £6 million to Jordan and £5 million to Turkey. 

Mr Cameron announced that Britain was doubling support for Lebanon's state schools to £20 million a year for the next three years, to help them cope with the influx of Syrian children. 

			 
The PM visited the Sed el Boucrieh primary school, which has tripled in size to 900 pupils due to the arrival of the Syrians. 

He met Lebanese and Syrian children enrolling for the first day of the academic year, including three-year-old Lyn es-Shami, whose mother told him she had already spent two years of her life in exile from hometown Homs - a centre of resistance to dictator Bashar Assad.

9070d6b9-2d3c-43c9-b0ed-94ff0fac9e67,"REUTERS — 12 MINUTES AGO 

By Tanya Agrawal 

(Reuters) - Wall Street opened lower on Friday as investors assessed August jobs data, which showed that fewer-than-expected jobs were added to the economy even as unemployment rate dropped to its lowest in more than seven years. 

Non farm payrolls increased 173,000 last month after an upwardly revised 245,000 rise in July and below the 220,000 that economists polled by Reuters had expected. Unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 percent and wages accelerated. 

The report underscored the U.S. economy's steady recovery in the face of volatile global financial markets and China's slowing growth, and kept alive the prospect of the U.S. Federal Reserve raising rates at its Sept. 16-17 meeting. 

At 9:41 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was down 197.62 points, or 1.21 percent, at 16,177.14, the S&P 500 was down 20.95 points, or 1.07 percent, at 1,930.18 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 38.70 points, or 0.82 percent, at 4,694.80. 

All the 10 major S&P sectors were lower with the energy index's 1.96 percent loss leading the decliners. 

""The unemployment rate has fallen while wages have accelerated — that will certainly give the hawks more ammunition for a September rate hike,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. 

Although job growth numbers came in below expectations, the August employment reports have often been sharply revised upward due to seasonal fluctuations. 

The recent turmoil in the market has prompted some investors to bet the Fed might wait until the end of the year to hike rates. 

But Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said last Friday it was still too early to decide if the volatility, which left the S&P 500 with its biggest monthly drop in three years in August, had made a September hike unfeasible. 

Marcus Bullus, trading director at MB Capital, said the August jobs data will do little to assuage investors reeling from the recent market volatility. 

""The August figure is an unconvincing start to the fall and will trigger even more concern in the markets about the state of the global economy."" 

The Fed has said it will increase rates only if it sees sustained economic recovery. While the labor market continues to gain strength, inflation stubbornly remains below the 2 percent target set by the central bank. 

Separately, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said he had seen enough healing in the U.S. labor market to warrant raising interest rates soon. 

Near-zero rates have allowed the U.S. stock market to stage a spectacular bull-run since the financial crisis. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing and impact the profit margins of companies. 

Caterpillar's shares were down 2 percent at 72.93after Baird downgraded the stock to ""neutral"". 

Netflix was down 1.9 percent at $98. The stock has fallen for the past five days. 

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,384 to 284. On the Nasdaq, 1,801 issues fell and 483 advanced. 

The S&P 500 index showed no new 52-week highs and 7 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 3 new highs and 34 new lows.

Parents: STEM Skills Are Taught in Most Oregon Afterschool Programs

WASHINGTON 

Findings from the new report are based on responses collected for America After 3PM from 30,000 U.S. households, including in-depth interviews with more than 13,000 parents and guardians, and 215 parents in Oregon 

""Afterschool is a dynamic, effective setting for innovative STEM education,"" said Afterschool Alliance Executive Director Jodi Grant 

Key findings from Full STEM Ahead, which is based on America After 3 PM, the most comprehensive survey ever to ask parents about their children's participation in afterschool STEM programs:

""The realities of the new economy are clear: STEM literacy and skills are essential for this generation to successfully navigate a rapidly changing job market and increasingly complex, technologically rich society,"" said Mark Lewis 

Full STEM Ahead offers recommendations to reduce missed opportunities in afterschool STEM education. They include engaging and educating parents about the important role afterschool programs can play in supporting STEM learning; increasing technology and engineering programming in afterschool programs; and increasing investment in afterschool programs so many more children can access the STEM learning opportunities these programs can provide.

In October 2014 

The America After 3PM survey was conducted by Shugoll Research; it is based on in-depth interviews with 13,709 households with children, completed via an online survey using a blend of national consumer panels. In order to participate, respondents had to live in the United States 

Full STEM Ahead is sponsored by Comcast Tech R&D Fund, the Noyce Foundation and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation. The Comcast Corporation's Internet Essentials program is the nation's largest and most comprehensive program to close the digital divide. Internet Essentials has connected more than 500,000 low-income families with school-aged children, or more than 2 million low-income Americans, to the power of the Internet at home.

America After 3PM is funded by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, The Wallace Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the Noyce Foundation, with additional support from the Heinz Endowments, The Robert Bowne Foundation and the Samueli Foundation.

The amateur baker, who has been plagued by timing problems throughout the series, quickly found himself in trouble when the contestants had to produce a short-crust pastry tart with frangipane as their “signature bake”. 
 
Having struggled to get his pastry into the oven on time, Alvin commented: “I wasted a couple minutes there, five or seven minutes rolling the pastry. There is no leeway for me, so I’m worried.”

His plum frangipane tart failed to impress co-judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry, with Paul pointing out the overbaked pastry and the undercooked frangipane. “Your base is far too thick. Your plums aren’t cooked either,” he told an apologetic Alvin, who explained: “Timing issues”. 
 
But while they agreed on Alvin’s bake, the judges had uncharacteristically different opinions on Flora Shedden’s apricot and rosemary frangipane tart. Paul scolded, “I think it’s overbaked”, while Mary countered, “It is overbaked, but it isn’t bitter and it isn’t burnt”.

Paul fired back: “It is burnt and it is bitter.” 
 
“I’ll tell you who’s bitter,” co-host Sue Perkins assured Flora.

The technical challenge was something no one had heard of: flaounes, a type of cheese pastry from Cyprus. The instructions left the bakers perplexed about what the end product should look – or even taste – like. 
 
Alvin, who works as a nurse in Berkshire, came second-from-bottom in the challenge, with Paul dubbing his creations “pizzas” and adding, “oh dear… it’s a de-constructed flaoune”. 
 
In a chat with Bake Off hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, Mary warned: “Alvin has really got to pull up his socks,” predicting that the 37-year-old would need “a miracle” to get through to the next week.

His final chance for redemption was the showstopper challenge, where the contestants were asked to produce two different batches of 24 vol-au-vents. 
 
Ian Cumming, who was previously awarded the title of Star Baker for three episodes in a row, presented a group of irregular vol-au-vents, which Paul said were “not Ian”. The squid ink pastries were simply “not good”, he added. 
 
Mat Riley, who also came first in the week’s technical challenge, impressed with his full English vol-au-vents, as well as his batch filled with horseradish and trout. “They look amazing,” Paul said, adding: “Flavours are gorgeous. Well thought out and well baked.” This earned him his position as Star Baker for the first time.

20d459dc-ff7c-488a-b734-52bcea9c659b,"Pope Francis canonized the first saint in North America -- Junipero Serra -- on Wednesday afternoon at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., before a crowd of thousands. 
 
Francis celebrated Mass before a large group on a lawn from an altar that had been erected at the east portico of the shrine for this historic occasion. 
 
At the Mass, the Rev. Ken Lavarone from San Diego, who was instrumental in pushing for Serra's canonization, presented the story of the 18th-century priest, detailing his missionary work in California and Mexico and laying the rationale for elevating him to sainthood. 
 
Serra and Francis both come from the Franciscan order with Francis the first Franciscan pope. 
   Presidents and Popes: Historic Meetings    
The gathered crowd cheered and clapped when Serra was officially named a saint.  
 
""Today we remember one of those witnesses who testified to the joy of the Gospel in these lands, Father Junípero Serra,"" Francis said, in Spanish, according to the official translation of his homily.  ""He was the embodiment of 'a Church which goes forth', a Church which sets out to bring everywhere the reconciling tenderness of God. Junípero Serra left his native land and its way of life. He was excited about blazing trails, going forth to meet many people, learning and valuing their particular customs and ways of life. He learned how to bring to birth and nurture God’s life in the faces of everyone he met; he made them his brothers and sisters. Junípero sought to defend the dignity of the native community, to protect it from those who had mistreated and abused it. Mistreatment and wrongs which today still trouble us, especially because of the hurt which they cause in the lives of many people."" 
 Read the full text of Pope Francis' Homily from the Canonization Mass    
The canonization ceremony was not without controversy. 
  Canonization of Junipero Serra Brings Controversy   
The first canonization on U.S. soil comes with controversy, News4's Aaron Gilchrist reports. Pope Francis has been accused of hypocrisy for planning to canonize Franciscan missionary Junipero Serra after apologizing for the “grave sins of colonialism,” a charge leveled by some Native Americans. (Published Tuesday, Sept. 22, 2015) 
 
To Francis, Serra was one of the United States’ founding fathers, a missionary who brought the Gospel to the New World. 
 
But to Valentin Lopez, the chairman of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band of the Costanoan/Ohlone Indians, Serra was the architect of a brutal mission system that enslaved and terrorized Lopez’s ancestors in California.   
 
“We’re disappointed but we’re not surprised,” said Lopez, who plans to cut his hair as a sign of mourning. “The church has ignored indigenous people for over 500 years.” 
 
This summer, Francis issued a broad apology for the church's treatment of indigenous populations.  
   Pope Francis' Papacy    
And Johyn Reyno, a Lakota Indian who lives in Kansas City, Missouri, and who attended the Mass, defended Serra's canonization. 
 
""We've let too much of the secular society bring us to a place where we are no longer spiritual brothers and sisters,"" he said. ""I think really honestly to have somebody give over their entire life, go to another continent and decide that they're going to live a ministry as a missionary, you're not giving over just a little bit. That's not a 40-hour job. And some people get focused on negative things rather than knowing that colonialism and Christianity aren't the same thing."" 
 
The Mass drew dignitaries among them Vice President Joe Biden and presidential candidate Jeb Bush. At least two Supreme Court justices were in attendance, Chief Justice John Roberts and Sonia Sotomayor. 
 
""Today feels amazing,"" said John Liston, executive director of Serra International, a international organization founded in 1935 that promotes priesthood and religious life within the Roman Catholic Church. ""It’s the first canonization to take place on North American soil and it’s the patron of our organization. He was the spiritual father of western California and we’re very proud to bear his name."" 
 
Earlier Wednesday, on Francis' first full day of his six-day visit to the United States, he was welcomed to the White House by President and Michelle Obama. While there, Francis said that climate change was a problem “which can no longer be left to a future generation.” 
 
American Catholics are committed to a “truly tolerant and inclusive” society in which individual rights must be protected, he said. 
 
He greeted crowds in downtown Washington, D.C., riding in the popemobile along a parade route around the National Mall, and afterward held a prayer service at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle with about 300 American bishops. 
 
Emily Click, the assistant dean for ministry studies and field education at Harvard Divinity School, was in the crowd on the White House lawn. One of the highlights for her was the spirit of the crowd, she said. 
 
""I could just feel the degree to which people really looked to him as a hopeful presence,"" Click said. ""There were little children who were severely disabled and there were elderly people. You saw people who probably don't stand very often getting out of their chairs and standing, I think out of respect."" 
 
Francis was greeted at the basilica by about 3,600 American seminarians and men and women novices. Cardinal Donald W. Wuerl and Monsignor Walter R. Rossi, the basilica's rector, accompanied Francis to the Blessed Sacrament Chapel for private prayer. 
 
Francis celebrated the Mass on the steps of the east side of the basilica before about 25,000. The Mass and homily were be in Spanish. 
 
Waiting for him before the Mass, 30-year-old Dari Herrera, a family case manager from Gaithersville, Maryland, at a not-profit social services agency, said she liked Francis’ naturalness and determination to forgo the symbols of privilege. 
 
“He does things the other popes didn’t do,” she said. “He’s so natural and so — he didn’t even want to go in the limousine yesterday."" 
 
As a Latino, who is speaking out for the poor and for immigrants, he sends a message especially at a time of divisive debates over immigration, she said. 
 
“For us as Latinos, we feel that he has represented us,” she said. “It doesn’t matter where we are from. We are human beings and we should help each other.” 
 
Twenty-one-year Nallely Arriaga of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, said she especially liked the steps Francis has taken to welcome Catholics back to the church, giving priests the authority for a year to forgive women who had had abortions, for example. 
 
“I think that would open a lot of doors for women who have actually aborted to not feel guilty and to get into church and feel closer to God,” she said. 
 
Francis has praised Serra’s willingness to leave his native Spain for hardships in the New World, asking in a homily in May, “I wonder if today we are able to respond with the same generosity and courage to the call of God.” 
 
The pope said that Serra defended Native Americans against abuses by colonizers and that his writings showed respect for indigenous people and their ways. 
 
Teresa Berger, a professor of Catholic theology at Yale University’s Divinity School said that a  number of factors could have drawn Francis’ attention to Serra, among  them Francis’ knowledge of the missionary work in the Americas and his  devotion to St. Francis. 
 
“There are some things that one can praise in Junipero Serra,” she  said. “And those are the things that I think Pope Francis has in his  mind. And there are also things that are deeply troubling. And that of  course is what particularly Native American communities have in mind  because they still suffer the consequences of that.” 
 
Francis has been accused of hypocrisy for planning to  canonize Serra after apologizing in June during a tour of South America for the “grave sins of  colonialism,” a charge leveled by some Native Americans. 
 
Berger disagreed. 
 
“No, they are just seeing different parts of a complicated legacy,” she said. 
 
Harvard Divinity School Professor Francis X. Clooney said that any choice for sainthood would likely be criticized. 
 
“Rarely, in modern times, do you find historical figures about whom  there would not be some controversy,” he said. “Even recently with Pope  John Paul II — many people were delighted that he was made a saint, but  many people had problems with his papacy and questions about it and  wished he hadn’t been made a saint.” 
 
Lopez and other Native American leaders said that ceremony would  signal that the Roman Catholic Church still treated Native Americans as  pagans and savages. Little has changed since official papal documents or  bulls of the 15th century considered indigenous people to be pagans,  savages and heathens, he said. 
 
In defending the beating of Native Americans, Serra wrote in 1780: ""That  spiritual fathers should punish their sons, the Indians, with blows  appears to be as old as the conquest of the Americas; so general in fact  that the saints do not seem to be any exception to the rule."" 
 
Lopez wrote this month in a letter to Francis that Indians were never  told that once baptized they were be confined involuntarily at the  missions and forced to labor for clergy and soldiers. They were captured  violently, enslaved, tortured and raped; their unhealthy diet and  squalid living quarters resulted in the deaths of an estimated 150,000  California Indians at the missions. 
 
“How the Catholic Church and you, Holy Father, can consider Serra’s  actions to be holy, sacred or saintly is incomprehensible to our Tribe,”  he wrote. 
 
The first saint to be canonized in the United States, Miguel Jose Serra was born in 1713 on the island of Majorca off the coast of Spain. He was influenced at an early age by St. Francis, and when he decided to enter the priesthood choose the name Junipero after one of St. Francis' companions. 
 
Serra set sail from Majorca in 1749 and after almost two months at sea, he and other missionaries arrived in Puerto Rico. He traveled on to Veracruz, Mexico, walked 250 miles to Mexico City and eventually made his way to San Diego. 
 
He founded nine missions in California before dying in Carmel in 1784. He is buried under the sanctuary floor of the mission church, Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo. 
 
In California, many streets, highways, trails, schools and monuments bear his name. His statue is one of two representing California in the U.S. Capitol’s National Statuary Hall along with one of former president and California Gov. Ronald Reagan. Its presence has come under debate as well. Some Californians want to replace him with astronaut Sally Ride, a proposal postponed until after the pope's visit. 
 
Clooney said that the process to sainthood was typically a long one with multiple stages. A religious figure is usually identified by a local church, and when support grows, messages begin to be relayed to the Vatican. 
 
“You don’t go from nothing to being a saint,” Clooney said. “What it’s supposed to be is that the pope and his advisors in Rome are recognizing a groundswell of the local church.” 
 
Because the path to sainthood is complicated, Clooney said that the decision to canonize Serra probably preceded Francis’s papacy. 
 
“The pope didn’t decide ‘Oh I have a trip coming up to the United States – who can we canonize while I’m there?’” said Clooney. “He probably was not the instigator of this in the first place, but allowed the process to be completed.” 
 
But Berger said she  thought it was Francis’ decision to move forward with the canonization during this trip. Serra was made “blessed” — the stage before sainthood — in 1988 by Pope  John Paul II, and could have remained at that stage indefinitely. 
 
The Vatican has recognized only one miracle performed by Serra, another controversial decision: A nun in St. Louis was cured of lupus after praying to him.

a8f31c73-418e-404c-8551-a4f7e354aedd,"On a recent afternoon inside the Cinemark Playa Vista multiplex, a sold-out movie theater was packed with more than 100 children and their parents. The youngsters weren't gathering to watch ""Minions"" or ""Inside Out"" for the zillionth time. Instead, they came armed with their laptops to competitively play the video game ""Minecraft"" together. 

""The theaters want to be a destination not just for movies but for entertainment,"" said Brett Morris, president and COO of Super League Gaming, a company that's turning conventional movie theaters into e-sports playgrounds for children. 

From their laptops, the players — mostly ages 7 to 14 — duked it on a virtual ""Minecraft"" playing field while a third-person perspective was projected on the mammoth theater screen, welcoming parental spectators and broadcasting bragging rights at the end of each round. 

After hosting several similar such preview events, Super League Gaming is kicking off its inaugural six-week fall season Oct. 5 in more than 30 cities, including Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami and Anchorage, Alaska. The season's top winner will receive a $5,000 scholarship. 

Super League Gaming, which has partnered with the AMC and Regal theater chains in addition to Cinemark, was born out of Morris' desire to marry the comradery of little league sports with the communal nature of old-school game arcades. 

""We grew up in a generation where we would go into an arcade and compete,"" said Morris, who has two gamer daughters. ""It wasn't just about competition. The memories we relished most were the social moments. Our kids don't have that face-to-face interaction."" 

Morris said the league's organizers selected ""Minecraft"" because the hugely popular brick-building game encourages creativity and collaboration. It's also an open-source title, meaning Super League Gaming organizers can freely tinker with it to suit their competitive needs. 

""We've made 'Minecraft,' the world's most popular game, better by adding this theater element,"" said Morris. ""We've built it to take advantage of all the interaction that the kids can have inside the theater. It's not the same experience as just playing by yourself."" 

Despite the competitive aspect of Super League Gaming, Morris said the organization isn't necessarily looking to groom the next generation of e-sports athletes. 

""Currently, e-sports is very competitive,"" said Morris. ""It's different with 'Minecraft.' We see ourselves as a recreational league below e-sports, where you can actually come in and play. Our kids are coming to the theater to play together, not just watch.""

Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's on Friday declared Ukraine's sovereign debt to be in ""selective default"" because of the war-torn nation's debt restructuring negotiations. 
 
Cash-strapped Ukraine has been struggling with its debt since entering a deep economic depression after war broke out with pro-Russian insurgents in its eastern industrial heartland early last year. 
 
The default means Standard & Poor's believes Ukraine will not repay its debt to all commercial bondholders in full. The downgrade affects only the bonds it has issued in foreign currencies, which had already been rated as vulnerable to default. 
 
Ukraine had invited commercial bondholders to debt restructuring meetings on October 14 with an offer that would include a 20 percent ""haircut"" in the money they are owed, and a delay on $11.5 billion in payments on the principal until after 2019, the agency said in a statement. 
 
Ukraine's offer includes its issuance of a 20-year bond whose return to investors will depend on the nation's economic growth, it said. 
 
""Ukraine's invitation constitutes the launch of what we consider to be a distressed debt restructuring,"" said Standard & Poor's, which had warned of the impending downgrade to default status a month earlier. 
 
If the restructuring negotiation with creditors is successful, Ukraine's rating will be upgraded to show it is no longer in default, but still vulnerable to default, it said. 
 
The pro-Western government's dispute with its commercial creditors appeared to be resolved when the sides struck what Kiev called a ""win-win"" agreement last month. 
 
But the August deal is on the verge of being shredded by a small group of private lenders who came out on its losing end. 
 
In August, Ukraine's US-born Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko crowned more than five months of excruciating discussions with Franklin Templeton and three other financial titans by signing a restructuring agreement that cuts Kiev's debt by a fifth. 
 
The terms went a long way toward meeting the $15.3 billion cost-cutting target that the International Monetary Fund had set in return for a $40 billion global rescue package to be granted under strict conditions over the coming four years. 
 
But those negotiations left out a smaller group of investors that included Aurelius Capital Management -- the same US hedge fund now battling the cash-strapped government of Argentina. 
 
Aurelius is particularly unhappy because it holds debts that come due in the coming months. It would therefore have to wait much longer for a return on its investment than Templeton and other creditors holding Eurobonds maturing at later dates.",S&P declares Ukraine in 'selective default',News,Yahoo!

147b1371-b2ca-4a12-93ab-75171c14abd9,"Harare – Zambia's opposition leader, Hakainde Hichilemba has reportedly been barred from entering Zimbabwe, where he was scheduled to address an opposition party congress led by former finance minister Tendai Biti. 

The MDC Renewal Team, a breakaway party from the Movement for Democratic Change, accused President Robert Mugabe's government of ""blocking"" its choice of guest of honour at the party's inaugural congress set to begin on Thursday in Harare, New Zimbabwe.com reported. 

""We had invited other social democrats from the region and Mr Hachilemba was supposed to be our guest of honour but, as has become the norm, president Mugabe's regime has thrown spanners in the works,"" party spokesperson Jacob Mafume was quoted as saying. 

An official from Zimbabwe's foreign affairs ministry, however, dismissed the accusations, saying the ministry had no mandate to deny anyone entry into Zimbabwe, according to News Day . 

""Foreign Affairs does not determine who comes into the country or not. It is the mandate of the department of immigration. We have no idea what they are talking about,"" the Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary, Joey Bimha, reportedly said. 

Former South African president Thabo Mbeki’s younger brother, Moeletsi, who had been expected to attend the congress, also indicated he would not be able to attend the gathering ""because he is committed elsewhere"". 

The congress comes two weeks after it was postponed by the police, who said at the time that the venue had already been booked by another group. 

At least 7 000 delegates are expected to attend the event, which is to be held under the theme: ""Reclaiming Zimbabwe"". 

The MDC Renewal Team was formed in April 2014, following its breakaway from the MDC led by Morgan Tsvangirai. This was after a major fall-out in which members called for the removal of Tsvangirai as the leader on the basis that he was betraying the principles of the party and adopting Mugabe's style of monopolising the party for his benefit.

24ad44db-9475-4946-9f0f-6e0910f2f102,"WEST CHESTER TWP. — 

Roadway improvements recently began at one of Butler County’s most frequently visited parks. 

Five individual projects at Voice of America MetroPark in West Chester Twp. will result in $315,647 in overall improvements to the infrastructure of park roads, according to Kelly Barkley, spokeswoman for MetroParks of Butler County. 

The roads where work is occurring provide access to Wiggly Field Dog Park, the cricket field and The Voice of America Park Athletic Complex, Barkley said. 

“The planned road enhancements are important because they provide a better park experience,” she said. “These improvements will provide a smoother ride when one travels on these roads and (allow for) the reduction of traffic dust.” 

Barkley said the work will be executed over the next several months before the onset of winter by four separate contractors: Ebony Construction Company, Performance Asphalt Paving, Stawser Construction and Valley Asphalt. 

MetroParks of Butler County will spend $57,864 from its general fund for repairs to the base of Practice Field Boulevard, which included filling potholes, as well as resurfacing the same area, Barkley said. 

Ohio Deparment of Transportation grant funding will pay for $257,783 worth of improvements, including base work, material and labor for the parking lot on the north side of the Athletic Complex and the “C”-shaped area around the complex, she said. 

The resurfacing of Practice Field Boulevard and the Athletic Field Drive up to the parking lot was completed last week, Barkley said. 

The black topping will be completed prior to year-end as the contractor’s schedule permits, she said. 

Access to all park areas is maintained for park guests during this period, Barkley said. 

Access to Wiggly Field Dog Park and the cricket field will occur from the entrance off of Butler- Warren Road as construction dictates. Signage will direct users to this entrance as needed.",Projects underway at one of Butler County’s most visited parks,News,The Western Star,2015-09-21T12:11:44Z

70893cb9-bc3d-4305-802c-5751e91595f1,"TEHRAN (FNA)- Yemen's Ansarullah revolutionaries and allied forces of the army took control of four military bases in Saudi Arabia's Province of Dhahran al-Janub, killing several Saudi soldiers in retaliation for Riyadh's ongoing airstrikes against their nation. 

On Saturday, the Yemeni forces gained control of the strategically important bases in the Saudi province, the Southwestern region of Asir. 
 
The Yemeni forces set fire to lookout towers and three munitions depots at the Saudi bases. The Ansarullah fighters also destroyed at least 19 military vehicles of Saudi forces in the region. 
 
Several Saudi soldiers are reported to have been killed in the latest operation by the Yemeni forces. 
 
Meanwhile, Ansarullah fighters targeted military installations in the regions of al-Hejlah and Jabal al-Doud in Jizan Province of Southern Saudi Arabia, inflicting heavy losses on Saudi forces. 
 
Saudi Arabia has been striking Yemen for 172 days now to restore power to fugitive president Mansour Hadi, a close ally of Riyadh. The Saudi-led aggression has so far killed at least 5,847 Yemenis, including hundreds of women and children. 
 
Hadi stepped down in January and refused to reconsider the decision despite calls by Ansarullah revolutionaries of the Houthi movement. 
 
Despite Riyadh’s claims that it is bombing the positions of the Ansarullah fighters, Saudi warplanes are flattening residential areas and civilian infrastructures.

According to the National Enquirer, Zellweger is in London working on the film, but doctors say that there’s no way that Renee can resemble Bridget Jones — in the way that fans lovingly remember her. 

“She clearly has had extensive work done. But the result is that she’s lost the look that America fell in love with,” said Dr. Lyle Back (he did not do any work on the actress). “I see signs of a face lift that has made her face look much less puffy, less rectangular and less tomboyish. Now she’s not the girl that people identify with,” he added. 

Renée Zellweger does look drastically different from how she did when she starred in the original Bridget Jones’ Diary back in 2001. Some fans think that her changed look is just the same as if movie execs hired a different actress to play the part. 

“The goal of plastic surgery is to make you look better – not unrecognizable. Bridget Jones is gone forever,” Dr. Back said. 

While Renée looks quite lovely still, she doesn’t look at all the same. According to Radar Online, docs think that the actress had a nose job, buccal fat pad removal, cheek implants, eyelid surgery, and more to transform her face. 

When she first stepped out with her new look in the fall of 2014, it’s all people could talk about. And while the news surrounding her face has calmed down over the past several months, her role in Bridget Jones has people talking all over again. 

Do you think Renée Zellweger looks different than her Jerry Maguire days? Do you think her new look will be a major problem for her role in Bridget Jones’ Baby?

569d1ae7-e11d-4c9b-8f21-90216b3e0787,"Real-estate mogul Donald Trump used his Tuesday question-and-answer session on Twitter to weigh in on two NFL quarterback-related topics. 
 
The Republican presidential front-runner first answered an inquiry about Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo’s collarbone injury and whether that would affect the team’s playoff chances. 
 
Though the questioner didn’t appear serious , Trump offered his analysis of the team. 
 
“The fact that Tony Romo got hurt is a terrible thing for the Dallas Cowboys. I think Tony is a great guy. I know him. And he’s also a great football player. And it certainly will hurt Dallas but their defence is excellent,” he said in a video posted in response . 
 
Trump then pivoted to tout his recent support from New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Trump repeatedly defended Brady amid his “Deflategate” scandal, and the two have showered praise on one another in recent weeks.  
 
“Tom Brady just came out and endorsed me. And Tom Brady had another fantastic game. A total winner. It’s going to be a very interesting season. But for Dallas, not good news. For the Patriots, the way that Tom’s playing, great news,” Trump added.

Trump later answered a question about whether Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco is an “elite” player, a popular sports meme .  
 
Though that question was also likely less-than-serious , Trump weighed in decisively that Flacco is, indeed, an elite quarterback.  
 
“I think Joe Flacco is actually a very elite quarterback. He won a Super Bowl,” Trump said . “He did it really to a certain extent with that great arm of his. I would say absolutely he is an elite quarterback.”

1c9b5295-40ce-4bcb-a491-8783bbe05ae0,"The Institute organized a public forum on regulation of dominant firms in Kenya, the event was held at the Nairobi Sarova Stanley Hotel on Thursday, 13 th August 2015. The event was well attended by a broad cross-section of stakeholders, including the media, advocates, the private sector, representatives from government institutions, and the general public. The objective of the forum was to clarify the content and rationale behind the Kenya proposed regulations and to hear a diversity of views on their effects on Kenyan consumers and competing firms. 
 
The regulations, among which include Fair Competition and Equality of Treatment regulations 2015 and Kenya Information and Communications Consumer Protection Regulations, 2015 seek to ensure that the largest firm in the telecommunications industry would be declared a dominant firms according to the completion act and create a level of field to all operators. 
 
Speaking during the forum, Mr. Benson Nyagol said Competition laws and judicial practice use a wide range of different terms and definitions to identify firms that are subject to single firm conduct provisions; dominance, monopoly power and market power. Convergence that single firm conduct  provisions should be applied only to firms that have “market power” and have abused that market power. Examples of abusive practices or behaviors include predation, refusal to deal, discrimination in dealing and unfair pricing. 
 
He further said that a firm holds a market power if it possesses enough market power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of the competitors, customers and ultimately consumers. Many jurisdictions provide thresholds for dominance which vary from one jurisdiction another. However, these thresholds are not determinative but presumptive of dominance. Variety of remedies may be used to curb dominance like ex-ante regulation (e.g. price controls) -reserved for natural monopoly situation and ex-poste regulation (like fines and damages, prohibiting the behavior in the future) -applicable in contestable markets, he added. 
 
Article 23 of the Competition Act defines dominance as the control of not less than one-half of the relevant market in Kenya or any substantial part of Kenya. It further states that not dominant but controls not less than 40% of the relevant market, unless it can show that it does not have market power. However, before claiming that a firm is dominant, it is important to define the market appropriately. Mr. Kwame Owino echoed Nyagol sentiments by saying that dominance comes about after conducting a thorough market test.",Public Forum on Regulation of Dominant Firms in Kenya,News,Institute of Economic Affairs,2015-09-02T15:40:13Z

69118188-b26c-45a2-8f48-450999c3945e,"Beaver Brook Township board is asking the town residents to do what the board cannot: Raise the tax levy by $100,000 annually to pay for improving the town roads. 

The board has passed a resolution to raise the township's tax levy by $100,000, with the money dedicated to road improvements, and the townspeople will vote it up or down at a special board meeting at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 24, at the town hall. 

Levy increases usually come through referendums, but municipalities with a population of less than 3,000 can hold the vote at an annual town meeting or special meeting. 
 
Chairman Gary Johnson said on Friday, Sept. 18, that the feedback he has heard so far is split evently in favor and against. 

He understands where each set of voters is coming from. “I get both sides of it,” he said. 

Johnson has served on the board for more than 20 years, and he said none of the board members want to raise taxes and they have worked to keep they levy low. It has gotten to the point, though, that the town cannot afford to upgrade its 30.52 miles of roads. 

He said overall the condition of the roads is “average,” with ratings on individual roads, based on state guidelines, being “all over the place” depending on factors such as when the road was built and its location. 

The board researched options for maintaining those roads beyond the seasonal grading, mowing, and plowing, and concluded that $110,000 would be needed each year for 30 years to maintain and upgrade the roads into the smooth blacktop drivers expect, including paving the town's six miles of gravel roads. 

What may happen if the resolution is not approved, according to Johnson, is that more roads will have the same fate as Wildcat Road, a paved road that this year was pulverized back a gravel road because the money was not there for blacktopping. 

Johnson said two informational meetings have been held, and 17 people attend the first one and 20 the second. 

The board members are elected to do what the people want, Johnson said, and the residents will have to give the board direction. 

“A lot of townships are facing the same thing,” he said. 

Evergreen Township 

Evergreen is one of those townships that experienced the same dilemma of the available levy not stretching far enough to keep the roads in shape. About five years ago the residents there approved the board’s resolution to levy an extra $113,000 (equivalent to one mill rate) annually for road improvements, with the idea of doing one mile a year. 
 
Like Johnson, Evergreen’s chairman, Melvin “Bill” LaPorte, had presented the town board’s case at two informational meetings. When the citizens cast their vote, the ayes outnumbered the nays by just two votes. LaPorte said previous boards worked hard to get the road system built and it is the town’s duty to maintain those roads. 

Now the township gets compliments on the roads, he said, recalling how one person told him, “It’s the best $150 [in taxes] I ever spent.” 

Already, however, the cost of the work is exceeding the funding. The price tag for this summer’s mile of road work was $117,000. That included grinding the asphalt, laying a 4-inch layer of gravel, and spreading 2 inches of blacktop. 

LaPorte characterized the $113,000 annual levy as a “stalling tactic,” saying, “You’re basically treading water.” 

State roads 

Like the townships, the state is hurting when it comes to reconstructing roads and other transportation projects. The 2015-17 state budget started out with $1.3 billion in borrowing for the Department of Transportation during the biennium, but the Legislature whittled that down to $850 million. At least $132 million and possibly another $175 million of that debt will be paid through the state’s General Fund rather than the Transportation Fund, which in turn reduces money available for non-transportation expenses. 

The state base transportation budget is nearly $6.4 billion (not including the $850 million that could be borrowed). 

An example of a project that suffered cuts in the new state budget is the Zoo Interchange Project near Milwaukee, a massive reconstruction of what is the state’s oldest and busiest interchange. A cut in funding for the third phase will delay the 2018 completion of the new interchange. The present one was built in the early 1960s and carries an average traffic count of more than 300,000 vehicles daily. The original construction estimate for the new roadway project was $1.7 billion, but some estimates project a cost closer to $2 billion or $2.3 billion.",Raising the levy to rebuild roads: Beaver Brook will vote on the issue this week,News,Rice Lake Chronotype,2015-09-23T10:00:00Z

Watch Everest (2015) Online Free Movie Stream Video Full Coverage Everest p2p Link. Here is a subdued true-life drama about a calamitous attempt to climb Mount Everest in 1996. It's a film with loads of ice, snow, beards, mountains, beards and men shouting desperate instructions at each other through their snowy beards. The tremulous womenfolk are pining and whining on the end of a radio receiver or telephone, while the heroic guys battle the elements. Jake Gyllenhaal has a role that turns out to be bafflingly peripheral. 
 

 
a breathless, large-scale 3-D action spectacle (directed by Baltasar Kormakur) about an ill-starred attempt to scale the planet's highest peak, was called into being with impressive star power and technical bravura. It definitely exists. But it never seems to get anywhere, taking up space and time without managing to be especially memorable or imposing.

In theory, the stakes should be high and the drama intense, as human beings battle the brute forces of nature in a life-or-death struggle. But though it assembles a first-rate cast in a story taken from reality, ""Everest"" feels icebound and strangely abstract, lacking the gravity of genuine tragedy or the swagger of first-rate adventure. 
 
This may be partly because one of the film's themes is the commodification of adventure, the colonization of a wild and dangerous terrestrial spot by tourists and thrill seekers. The individual climbers who receive most of our attention are treated with empathy and respect - the Westerners, that is; the Nepalese Sherpas who guide and assist them barely figure at all - but Everest itself is a mob scene. The feeling of discovery, of primal wonder at the inhuman sublimity of the mountain, has been compromised. People with a lot of money and little climbing experience turn the base camp into a virtual trailer park and litter the upper slopes with discarded ropes, flags and oxygen tanks. Professional tour leaders are expected to ensure the safety of clients who insist on pushing toward the summit despite potentially fatal risks. 
 
""Everest"" turns partly on the rivalry between two seasoned climbers: Rob Hall, a stoic, disciplined New Zealander played by the ever-solid Jason Clarke; and Scott Fischer, a gonzo American played with marvelous mischief by Jake Gyllenhaal. Their ascent in the spring of 1996, during which eight people died and many others suffered severe frostbite, was the subject of Jon Krakauer's best-selling book ""Into Thin Air.""

LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - September 17, 2015) - Los Angeles-based GreenLight Media & Marketing has been recognized with three CLIO Music Awards, which will be presented at a ceremony on September 30 in New York City. GreenLight was awarded two bronze awards for its Hyundai ""GRAMMY Amplifier"" program in the Integrated Campaign and Partnership categories in addition to a bronze for its Ultimate Ears ""Make Music Social"" program in the Integrated Campaign category. 

""We are honored to be recognized for these meaningful initiatives by the CLIO Music Awards,"" said Dominic Sandifer, president and co-founder of GreenLight Media & Marketing. ""We are also incredibly appreciative of having such wonderful brand and music partners to create engaging content that unites fans worldwide."" 

Following is background on each one of the winning campaign efforts: 
 Hyundai's GRAMMY Amplifier: Hyundai partnered with The Recording Academy to launch the third installment of this program. Any independent artist could participate by submitting songs at GRAMMYAmplifier.com. The top 15 finalists were chosen based on their track plays and social media ""amplifications"" from fans. Three Amplifier award recipients were then selected by some of the biggest names in music including Mark Ronson, The Band Perry, Ziggy Marley and Allen Stone, and were given an opportunity to take their careers to the next level. The professional opportunities they were awarded ranged from participating in a studio recording session with a GRAMMY winning producer, to filming and starring in their own music video with a noted director, to performing as an opening act on the tour of a noted musician, and/or on the stage at a major music festival. GreenLight and The Grammys documented the winners' progress in a branded online series that gave fans a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process. Music was featured from the finalists in curated playlists on Spotify, Pandora and Rdio. For more background on the program, view the case study video HERE . Ultimate Ears' #MakeMusicSocial : For the continuation of its 2013 award-winning Make Music Social campaign for the Logitech brand, in 2014-2015 GreenLight developed a multifaceted content marketing strategy across a variety of digital platforms to engage both content creators and artists around the globe. From noted YouTube creators like Miranda Sings and Nathan Barnett, to globally recognized artists such as Skrillex and EDM violinist Lindsey Stirling, Greenlight and its partners created content designed to showcase how everyone should ""make music social"" by using the UE Boom wireless bluetooth speaker and then aggregated that content on a branded Tumblr website ( www.makemusicsocial.com ), as well as across each artist's social media channels via YouTube, Tumblr, Facebook and Buzzfeed. In total, 200+ pieces of original content were created and consumed by 31 million fans. In addition, the video with Lindsey Stirling was the most engaged branded video on Tumblr in 2014, and UE BOOM sales continue to grow -- making it one of the top-selling wireless bluetooth speakers in the world.

6f097327-6206-4d46-af91-3dbb9348b2b1,"AFL fans, particularly Hawthorn's and Sydney's, have thrown their support behind a player who still holds a special place in their hearts. 

Hawthorn fans were hostile towards Lance 'Buddy' Franklin when he left the club as a two-time premiership winner for the seemingly greener pastures of the Sydney Swans, but those same fans have thrown their support behind a player who still holds a special place in their hearts. 

As news came to light on Tuesday that Franklin - arguably the AFL's best player - suffered an epileptic fit on Friday before making himself unavailable for the Swans' final against Fremantle, supporters, be they Buddy-lovers or Buddy-haters, offered their most sincere well-wishes. 

Criticism of Franklin's decision to step away from the game indefinitely has been almost non-existent. 

Fans from all different clubs have thrown their utmost support behind Franklin on social media and passed on a clear message that the entire AFL community is with, and not against him, as he tackles his biggest off-field hurdle. 

""I'm a hawks supporter but I'll always be a Buddy fan,"" wrote Laura Schembri on the Swans official Facebook page. ""Best wishes Buddy."" 

""Do what you need to do Buddy,"" wrote another user. ""Stay well....come back strong. I wish you were still with the Hawks.......but just do what is good for you. Champion."" 

There was overwhelming support for Franklin from his new fans at Sydney, but the well wishes from those at Hawthorn shows that the issue of mental health transcends club rivalry and any bitterness in the past.

Sporting identities and celebrities were also quick to let the 28-year-old know he wasn't alone in his battle with mental illness and applauded his decision to go public about how he is coping.

458a9649-f14a-4908-9c14-b59ac8151d6f,"WASHINGTON (CNN) – Hillary Clinton contrasts herself with Republicans in her campaign’s newest television ad, the first time she has done so. 

The ad, entitled “Get Ahead,” knocks Republicans for not supporting equal pay for women, paid family leave or allowing students to refinance student debt and tracks with what Clinton regularly says in her campaign stump speech. 

“If you work hard, and do you part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead,” Clinton says in the ad. “But the Republicans, they want to go back to letting the super wealthy call the shots. They don’t stand up for equal pay for women. They don’t support paid family leave. They don’t even really support refinancing student debt.” 

She adds, “We’ve got to get this economy working for the vast majority of Americans, not just for those at the top. That’s what I intend to do as president.” 

Clinton regularly hits Republicans on the economy at events across the country, faulting them for wanting to take America back to “trickle-down economics, one of the worst ideas to come out of the 1980s,” as she said earlier this month in Manchester, New Hampshire. 

Unlike her stump speech, Clinton does not hit any Republicans candidates by name in the 30-second spot, which is part of the campaign’s ongoing buy in Iowa and New Hampshire and will run alongside previously released ads. 

Clinton’s previous ads have been primarily biographical, focused more on the highlights of Clinton’s plan, not how they contrast with Republicans. 

Her last ad, entitled “Every Child,” invokes her granddaughter, Charlotte, in a call for all children to have to enjoy the same opportunities in law. 

In a similar direct-to-camera ad entitled “Stretched,” Clinton argues that “raising family incomes is the defining economic challenge of our time.”","First on CNN: In new ad, Clinton draws contrast with Republicans",News,Classic Hits 99.3 The Eagle,2015-09-25T09:00:05Z
cdd82b7a-7301-4dd8-8a20-9eb54d3d534e,"French, German, Russian and Ukrainian leaders meet in Paris on Friday to try to inject new life into Ukraine’s peace process at a time when global attention has been diverted to Syria.

Although a ceasefire has largely held between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels since the start of September, a lasting political solution is still a long way off. 

Under the Minsk II agreement signed in February, eastern Ukraine is supposed to hold local elections by the end of the year and hand back control of the Russian border to the government in Kiev. 

Those issues will top the agenda in Paris on Friday, along with ensuring access for international observers to rebel zones, and the removal of heavy weapons from the frontline. 

There was good news on Wednesday when Ukraine announced an initial agreement with the insurgents to withdraw smaller weapons from the buffer zone between their forces. 

But Russia’s dramatic moves over the past month to intervene directly in the Syrian conflict has added a new and uncertain dimension to the negotiations. 

By making himself an important player in Syria, Russian President Vladimir Putin may be hoping to leverage a better deal on Ukraine — particularly an easing of damaging economic sanctions that were imposed after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula last year. 

“The Russians will use Syria to distract attention from Ukraine. More pressure must be exercised against them,” a senior Ukrainian official said. 

With European officials desperate for anything that could slow the numbers of refugees out of Syria, some are tempted by a rapprochement with Russia. 

“We can’t keep long-running sanctions (against Russia) on the one hand, and ask to work together on the other,” said German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel this week. 

That is not the official line out of Berlin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office said this week that the Syrian and Ukrainian cases could not be linked. 

Many believe Russia ensured there was less fighting in eastern Ukraine as Putin prepared the ground for his moves in Syria and renewed talks over Ukraine. 

“The ceasefire has been largely respected since September 1. That shows the influence Russia has over the separatists,” said Steffen Seibert, Merkel’s spokesman. 

Despite Russian denials, Ukraine and the West accuse Moscow of covertly supporting the rebels with troops, weapons and technology, fomenting a conflict that has left more than 8,000 dead since it began in April 2014. 

“Putin wants zero percent of the territory but he wants to maintain this unstable zone to show that Ukraine’s efforts to move towards Europe are not going to work,” said a European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 

– Political progress – 

French President Francois Hollande said in early September that he was open to lifting sanctions on Russia if eastern Ukraine gets the elections and greater self-rule promised under the Minsk accords. 

Pro-Russian rebels have said they will hold local elections on October 18 in Donetsk, and November 1 in Lugansk. A possible second round is planned for February. 

But there are plenty of issues still to resolve. 

“Nothing has been established on the political front,” said the European diplomat. 

“How will observers, the Ukrainian election commission, be able to enter the rebel zone for elections?” the diplomat added. 

The European Union is due to evaluate progress on the Minsk accords at the end of the year before deciding whether to maintain sanctions on Russia. 

The Ukrainian government is particularly sceptical about Russian intentions, and worries about any signs of a warming relationship between Russia and the West which could ease pressure on Moscow. 

It also has to face down protests by right-wing nationalists on its own side, who fiercely oppose greater autonomy for the east. A recent protest in Kiev left four dead. 

President Petro Poroshenko this week mocked Putin’s claims to be setting up an international coalition against the Islamic State group. 

“That’s a nice story, but it’s hard to believe,” said Poroshenko at the United Nations this week. 

“How can you call for an anti-terrorist coalition when you are encouraging terrorisim on your doorstep?”

2a326e23-4028-4897-8dbe-20ac8ce47b32,"Jim Harbaugh was first to greet Jake Rudock on the Michigan sideline after he threw the pick-6 that pretty much ended any hope the Wolverines had of winning the much-hyped debut of their much-hyped coach.

The coach put an arm around his player, told him that the Utah defensive back made a great play and gave the forlorn quarterback a pat on the helmet.

Michigan fans will need to have the same type of patience with their team. Harbaugh has restored hope to the proud program, but as the 24-17 loss to the Utes on Thursday night showed, a return to glory is going to take some time.

""A lot of positives,"" Harbaugh said. ""Some things to build on.""

After an offseason filled with Harbaugh-mania, it was time to play some football, but in many ways Harbaugh's Michigan Wolverines looked a lot like the ones coached last season by Brady Hoke, who was fired after going 5-7.

Too many turnovers by the quarterback (Rudock threw three picks). Little production from the running game (76 yards on 29 carries). A defense that played OK, but got little support.

""I thought we had a great game plan,"" said tight end Jake Butt, who had eight catches for 93 yards and a touchdown. ""We just didn't execute.""

Linebacker Joe Bolden echoed that. ""I sound like a broken recorder, but we didn't execute,"" he said.

Harbaugh gave a little laugh when he was told how the players harped on lack of execution.'

""I think they are being too hard on themselves,"" he said.

Since that January day in Ann Arbor when Harbaugh was introduced as coach of his alma mater, he has been the most interesting man in college football. An internet sensation to rival the Kardashians. He has inspired Michigan fans to put Gatorade on their cereal, proclaimed his profound admiration for Judge Judy and pulled off the interstate to help two women who had been in a car wreck.

He has made wearing khakis ironic in Ann Arbor.

Harbaugh appeared at ease before the game, roaming the field to chat with assistants and watch his team warm up. It was 90 degrees in Salt Lake City, but that didn't change the Harbaugh uniform: Dark blue, long sleeve shirt, tucked into his khakis. Blue baseball cap with a big maize block M.

Business as usual.

Or maybe not.

""I feel a little bit more, personally, nervous about this beginning than any other,"" said Harbaugh's wife, Sarah, before the game. ""I think there's a tremendous amount of pressure on him right now.""

Michigan's recent past belies its status as the winningest program in college football history. Three years of under Rich Rodriguez and four under Hoke produced one season of double-digit victories.

Harbaugh has brought success everywhere he has been, and at Stanford and with the San Francisco 49ers, he took over much worse situations and built championship-level teams. He was the only coach Michigan fans really wanted.

""It was definitely a national holiday in our house when we heard that Jim Harbaugh was going to be the next coach,"" said David Spitzley, who made the 8-hour drive from Denver with his wife and three young daughters. ""... Really want to see signs that things are going in the other direction now. The win total's probably less important than the product on the field and what does it look like. It was almost unwatchable recently.""

Sarah Harbaugh understands the hope her husband has inspired in Michigan, but she would be happy to hear about those modest expectations.

""Hopefully they don't have to be patient,"" she said.

Harbaugh's debut turned into one of the biggest home games in Utah history, drawing a record crowd of 47,825 to Rice-Eccles Stadium and more media members than could fit into the press box.

FS1 was televising the game and treated it like a bowl, bringing its studio to Rice-Eccles and providing five separate feeds for viewers to follow the game.

""Someone told there's going to be a camera that's just on his face the whole game. Who does that?"" Sarah Harbaugh said.

Yes, khaki cam, as Fox called it, was all Jim Harbaugh all the time.

Michigan hung around against a good Pac-12 opponent until Justin Thomas stepped into front of Rudock's sideline pass and returned it 55 yards for a score that make it 24-10.

Rudock led a late TD drive to keep the score respectable, but Harbaugh saw more than garbage-time touchdown.

""He shook off that play and came fighting back. As did all of our team,"" Harbaugh said.

Next week will be another milestone of sorts for Harbaugh: His first game coaching in the Big House, where he played quarterback for Bo Schembechler. Oregon State is the opponent, but there will be no easy games for the Wolverines.

Hoke often tried to spin the positive side of the losses, but it usually fell flat with fans.

Harbaugh comes with more credibility. So when he says he was impressed, Michigan fans may have reason to believe him.

04532e03-f671-48ef-9aa1-a33efbe92397,"A PETITION with more than 17,000 signatures calling for upgrades to the Pacific Hwy to be diverted away from a koala population near Ballina has failed to sway the government's plans. 

Debate in NSW Parliament last week revealed the Coalition's intentions were unchanged, despite the urges of local residents and environment groups. 

Labor MP Jodi McKay said the koala population on the Blackwall Range was already rapidly decreasing, without being dissected by a major highway. 

She said in the past seven months the Friends of the Koala had recorded six koalas killed on the roads, two killed by dogs and foxes, seven by chlamydia and two were euthanised. 

""In these circumstances the solution is clear - the roads should be re-routed, and 17,000 people across NSW agree,"" she said. Nationals MP Andrew Gee said the government opposed the petition's sentiment. 

""We are investing millions to protect flora and fauna along this route, and we're implementing specific measures to protect koalas,"" he said. 

""They include fully fencing nearly 16km of both sides of the new highway which will be connected to fauna-crossing structures."" 

Under the plan, the number of fauna crossings will increase from the current six structures to 25. 

A land bridge at least 30m wide north of the Richmond River near Bagotville will also be built, and 130ha of eucalypts will be planted - at least half before construction begins. 

International Fund for Animal Welfare policy and campaigns manager Matthew Collis said there was no proof the measures would have any positive impact on the koala population. 

""We have no reason to believe that anything in the new study will change from the previous study, which showed dire consequences if the highway does dissect that colony outside Ballina on the Blackwall Range,"" he said. ""It found it would likely go extinct within 20 years or so."" 

Mr Collis said recent surveys had revealed the Blackwall Range habitat was home to about 170 or 180 koalas - fewer than the original estimate of 200. 

""We also now know how significant this population is. It's a source for breeding programs and the dispersal of other populations heading up towards Byron as well,"" he said. 

""This route was chosen before we knew how important and vulnerable the population was. 

""Surely it's possible to find a way to avoid that particular part of the Blackwall Range."" 

Mr Collis urged the government to re-think its position and devise a new route that would not cut a koala habitat down the middle. 

""With all the technology we have around road building and the dangerously low number of koalas across the state and the eastern part of the country, it should not be beyond us to find a way to protect this Australian icon,"" he said.",Koala petition fails to appease,News,Daily News,2015-09-07T06:32:31Z
efc9b3f7-bfb2-4861-8e6d-d5bc58fb3fc3,"Wales' master of the so-called chop tackle will aim to cut down Fiji on Thursday and elevate his team further towards World Cup quarter-final territory. Flanker Dan Lydiate's defensive quality has underpinned many Wales victories during the past six years, with a relentless tackle-count proving to be a major feature of his game. Lydiate will line up for the 50th time in Wales colours against Fiji - his back-row colleague Taulupe Faletau also reaches the half-century landmark - and he remains an integral part of head coach Warren Gatland's team structure.

The chop tackle was born at World Cup time in New Zealand four years ago, named simply because of a need to tackle players and get them to ground as quickly as possible.

""It came about while working with (Wales defence coach) Shaun Edwards in the pool of death we had last time, with South Africa, Fiji and Samoa all being physical teams,"" Lydiate said.

""It was trying to get players to the deck as soon as we could, and so that other players we had in the team like Gethin (Jenkins) and Sam (Warburton) could get over the ball.

""It developed from there and is something that has been highly effective for us.

""There are different types of tackles, and you are not always going to get it right.

""We vary our tackling, so in the last couple of years we started choking a few teams in the tackle and got success out of that. I pride myself on my defence, and when I do it right it is highly effective.""

It requires a huge amount of bravery to implement the chop tackle at maximum effect, and Lydiate added: ""I find that it hurts me less when I do it properly. With the law of averages you are going to get some wrong.

""It's like when I tried to chop against Uruguay. I chopped the one way, and (Wales lock) Dom Day came to finish him (Uruguay player) off and it clicked my neck, so it is going to happen.

""But when I get it right it doesn't hurt at all, other than if I went high and had an elbow to the face or something which is going to hurt me a lot more. It has worked for the last couple of years, but I don't just work on that in training.""

Wales know from a painful World Cup campaign eight years ago how dangerous Fiji can be, with the South Sea Islanders claiming a pool stage triumph in Nantes that knocked Wales out and meant coach Gareth Jenkins lost his job.

Victory on Thursday, though, would put Wales clear at the top of their group from heavyweight rivals Australia and England, with England then knowing that defeat against the Wallabies on Saturday would see them eliminated.

""It will be a massive challenge,"" Lydiate added. ""It is a home game for us, but we will not be taking them lightly by any means. If we do, we will be punished.

""Play against any South Sea Islands team, and they are that much harder to defend against because they vary from one game to the next.

""There is no set structure, but if you kick loosely to them and they get a head of steam and get over the gain-line, their off-loading game comes into play and it is a hard day at the office then.

""We have to stop that at source and stick to our structure and force our game-plan on them.""

Even after the game is done and dusted, Lydiate's work will not be done, as Wales squad tradition means that any player reaching 50 caps has to sing a song in front of his team-mates.

""I will be on my iPod (looking for songs),"" Lydiate said. ""I doubt if Toby (Faletau) will do it. I have never heard him sing before, so he could have a voice like an angel.

""I do not think a duet has been done before, but I can say there is not much planning that has gone into this.""",Wales flanker Dan Lydiate: Chop tackle is highly effective,News,Belfast Telegraph,2015-09-30T12:10:08Z

In the last year a host of technology businesses have debuted on the ASX, with the shares of many shooting up to stratospheric heights. And as with the tech boom of the late 90s, many aren't making any profit.

Memories do tend to be pretty short on the market, but I think this time around things are different - at least for some of these newer tech hopefuls. Let's take 'cloud' based construction project management platform provider, Aconex (ACX), as an example.

In essence, the company provides software for construction companies that facilitates collaboration on major construction projects. Its platforms help builders get it right on everything from tender management to safety on site.

As with several other new software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, Aconex improves efficiency for its customers, and proudly touts the fact that its software can reduce the risk of cost overruns (which are all too common on large construction projects).

It recently announced a strategic partnership with CIMIC Group Limited (CIM) (the old Leighton), suggesting that the biggest players in the industry see the value in its offering.

Unlike the tech bubble of the late 1990s, companies like Aconex have a clear business model and path to monetisation. Pre-2000, investors only cared about 'eyeballs' (the number of visitors a site could generate), and just had faith that profits would eventually flow. The market isn't so naive this time around, and sales (and subsequent profits) are a key focus.

And Aconex is bringing in plenty of dollars; more than $82 million in revenue last year, up over 20% on the previous years. Despite this, little is left over once costs are accounted for, and the company made a loss before tax of about $8 million.

But here's the good news, and something that is typical for these kind of businesses -- they scale wonderfully. Due to the nature of their fixed cost structure and extremely high gross margins, SaaS businesses can virtually double sales with relatively little additional expense

It gets better. These types of services tend to be very 'sticky'. Once you have a customer it is usually difficult for them to leave, due to various 'network effects'. That is, the service becomes more valuable the more users that are habituated to using it, and when you leave you are potentially risk substantial switching costs -- or hampering workflow. The end result is a good degree of pricing power and high levels of recurring revenue.

But there are risks too, of course. Plenty of other software companies that see the opportunity and are scrambling to lock in new customers. It's a real land grab, and there's no sense in taking things slow -- once customers are locked into another system, it will be incredibly hard to win them over.

That means that companies like Aconex are spending big on sales teams, marketing and offices in foreign markets -- and that's doing a lot to crimp profits. But this is do or die, and being too conservative will almost certainly spell long term failure.

Another problem is that the market's (understandable) enthusiasm for these types of businesses mean that there is a heck of a lot of expectation backed into the price. After raising fund at $1.90 per share in the IPO late last year, shares in Aconex soon rallied to over $4.50 -- almost 9 times 2015 revenue. Foolish takeaway

No matter how good a company is, no matter how attractive its future potential, it's easy to pay too much and achieve poor returns. While current valuations of Aconex may seem lofty, investors should consider the operational leverage, the potential for significant sales growth, and the demonstrable success Aconex has had in winning new customers.

As with all richly valued loss-making companies, the risks are not insignificant. However, for those with a tolerance for volatility and a capacity to look beyond the short term, a skittish market can offer great opportunities to buy tomorrow's winners at an attractive price.

3ccd4dfe-c9d4-4ab1-8b7e-9ff85287ee33,"There’s a selfie stick; lack of 3G is lamented; and Ant & Dec get a mention.

But adapter Nigel Williams and director Timothy Sheader wisely and largely avoid any tinkering with the fundamentals, preferring instead to get to the heart of William Golding’s landmark novel as the basis for their excellent new production.

Designer Jon Bausor gives everyone precisely the platform on which to excel with his desert-island plane-crash set, offering the perfect mix of precise detail (strewn clothes) and suggestion (dense jungle and rocks) for this most sinister of tales to unravel.

The survivors of the plane crash start as young English gentleman; but civilisation is the most superficial of acquisitions in Golding’s world. Savagery soon erupts; but far more interesting is Golding’s depiction of the way superstition and ritual emerge, both to sustain the violence and restrain it.

Before long, school-room bully Jack (Freddie Watkins) is a face-painted savage, creating his own mythology amid all the madness. It’s a terrific performance from Watkins, matched by

Luke Ward-Wilkinson who shows us a Ralph clinging on to decency. In the middle of it all

Anthony Roberts is outstanding as the wise, but vulnerable Piggie; Matthew Castle’s Roger

is a brute who finds his expression in terror.

It’s a chilling, compelling portrait… one you could easily transpose just about anywhere foul things are happening, exactly the reason Golding’s tale is the classic it is.

There’s often the slight feeling that Southampton isn’t the best place to see drama. This production proves the feeling a total misperception. With its epic scale and its breath-taking set, Lord of the Flies lets the Mayflower shine as the perfect venue for dark, compelling theatre at its best in a production which flows beautifully and grips completely.

94f94409-74ff-4cbf-bfb7-44495c355beb,"LENEXA, KS -- (Marketwired) -- 09/02/15 --  Digital Ally, Inc. (NASDAQ: DGLY) (""the Company"") today clarified the recent decision of an Examiner of the United States Patent & Trademark Office (""USPTO"") respecting Digital Ally's U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 ('292 Patent). The '292 Patent is generally directed to a system that determines when a recording device, such as a law enforcement officer's body camera or in-car video recorder, begins recording and responsively instructs other associated recording devices to begin recording. 

On September 2, 2015, Taser International, Inc. issued a press release announcing that the USPTO rejected the claims of Digital Ally's '292 Patent. Digital Ally believes that Taser's press release may be misleading in stating that the ""claims were found unpatentable by the USPTO."" The USPTO only recently made an initial, non-final action related to the '292 Patent and therefore, has not made a final determination of unpatentability. In fact, Digital Ally has the opportunity to discuss the merits of the prior art and the scope of the patent claims with the Examiner who issued this initial, non-final action and to freely amend the patent claims. Digital Ally will be filing a response in the near future. Therefore, to say the patent has been found invalid is incorrect. Digital Ally is confident that material aspects of the technology disclosed in the '292 Patent will ultimately be found patentable. Digital Ally is committed to obtaining valid patents for its technology, and further examination by the USPTO due to Taser's reexamination will only strengthen the ultimate validity of any claims to issue from the reexamination. 

""Taser's concern with Digital Ally's patent is presumably based on the similarities between Taser's Axon Signal product, which is just coming on the market, and Digital Ally's VuLink product, which has been on the market for well over a year,"" stated Stanton Ross, CEO of Digital Ally, Inc. ""We can only surmise that Taser was concerned with infringing the '292 Patent. Based on what we know so far of Taser's Axon Signal, it appears to be offering many of the same features that Digital Ally has long been offering via its VuLink product,"" continued Ross. ""Competition in the marketplace is ultimately a good thing for the customer -- provided, of course, that it is fair competition."" 

""Digital Ally will continue to innovate and produce the highest quality products with optimal technological solutions. We also will continue to seek patent protection for our innovations, as we have successfully done for many years now,"" concluded Mr. Ross.

A wide variety of factors that may cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: whether the several aspects of its disclosed technology in the '292 Patent will ultimately be found patentable by the USPTO and if so the extent to which the '292 Patent will give the Company effective, enforceable protection of the intellectual property contained in its products in the marketplace; competition from larger, more established companies with far greater economic and human resources; the effect of changing economic conditions; and changes in government regulations, tax rates and similar matters.

c37ac3df-2213-4249-8db8-0f7e7cbd6ff3,"DEAR DR. FOX: My almost-12-year-old Labrador retriever has recently exhibited signs of severe anxiety. 
  
He’s panting and pacing a lot, and recently started waking in the middle of the night to pant and pace. He’s been increasingly barking at passersby and seems more anxious than usual at being left home alone — with the run of the house — during the day, although he’s not damaging anything. While he’s always been a little anxious at thunderstorms, that anxious behavior is now happening with greater frequency, more severity and absent thunderstorms. 
 
He seems in otherwise decent shape. He has some fatty tumors, which the vet has said are not particularly problematic; he eats well, drinks well and eliminates with no problems. He has slowed down, sleeps a little more and can no longer jump into the car, although he manages stairs. 
 
What do you think is the problem, and is there something we can do to relieve his anxiety? — A.F., Rockville, Maryland 
 
DEAR A.F.: Many animals, including the human species, show signs of anxiety associated with age-related impairment of sight, hearing and cognition, and chronic debilitating conditions, such as painful arthritis. The latter can be ameliorated with various supplements, which you should discuss with your veterinarian. Add to his regular diet small portions of high-quality protein, such as egg, turkey and cottage cheese — especially if he is losing weight or muscle mass, a condition called sarcopenia, common in the elderly. Give him a tablespoon or two of coconut oil daily, which has been shown to help improve brain function in old dogs. Above all, keep him off slippery floor surfaces and provide him with a soft bed and nonslip carpet so he does not tear ligaments and damage joints sliding all over. Also discuss with your veterinarian giving your dog a light dose of Valium in the morning and melatonin in the evening. 
 
DEAR DR. FOX: Thank you! We are doing a few of these things anyway, particularly the anti-skid mats, although he’s smart enough to bounce around on the carpet and calm down a bit on the tile. My vet has recommended carprofen twice a day. We’ve tried this for five days, and it’s like he’s a new dog. However, I have read a lot of the information on the Senior Dogs Project website about Rimadyl, and now I’m concerned that this treatment may cause more problems than it’s worth. — A.F. 
 
DEAR A.F.: Carprofen, marketed as Rimadyl, can give short-term relief for dogs with arthritis. In my opinion, it should only be used for up to three days because of the risk of harmful side effects, notably nausea, gastrointestinal inflammation and bleeding, and liver and kidney damage. 
 
Excellent results have been seen in arthritic dogs given supplements such as fish oil, ginger and turmeric, and in preparations like Cosequin, which contains glucosamine, chondroitin and methylsulfonylmethane. Discuss these safer alternatives with your veterinarian.

dfa19a82-278e-4481-b44b-c155ff5230a0,"PHILADELPHIA - Tony Romo joined Dez Bryant on the injured list with a broken left collarbone, but the Dallas Cowboys shut down DeMarco Murray and beat the Philadelphia Eagles 20-10 on Sunday. 

Kyle Wilber returned a blocked punt 26 yards for touchdown, Brandon Weeden threw a 42-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams and the Cowboys (2-0) overcame a franchise-record 18 penalties in their 10th consecutive road win. 

Romo suffered a similar injury in Week 7 in 2010 and missed the rest of the season. The team said he'll be evaluated on Monday. Dallas already lost Bryant last week . The All-Pro receiver will miss at least six weeks after having foot surgery. 

Murray had 2 yards rushing on 13 carries in his first game against his former team. Sam Bradford had three turnovers, including an interception in the end zone, for the Eagles (0-2).

BROWNS  28, TITANS 14 

CLEVELAND - Johnny Manziel threw a 60-yard touchdown pass to Travis Benjamin on Cleveland's second play and connected with his wide receiver again for a clutch 50-yarder with 2:52. 

Benjamin also returned a punt 78 yards for a TD in the first half as the Browns (1-1) got just their third home-opening win since 1999. 

Starting in place of injured Josh McCown, Manziel finished 8 of 15 for 172 yards. His last completion was vintage Johnny Football as Manziel spun to his left to avoid pressure and threw deep to Benjamin. 

Manziel won his Heisman Trophy matchup with Marcus Mariota, who threw two TD passes in the second half for the Titans (1-1), but took a pounding in his second game. The No. 2 overall pick was sacked seven times. 

___ 

BUCCANEERS 29, SAINTS 19 

NEW ORLEANS - Jameis Winston passed for a touchdown and ran for another and Tampa Bay held on against mistake-prone New Orleans. 

Winston, who was intercepted twice and sacked four times in a losing NFL debut at home a week earlier, remained largely composed in the hostile Superdome. He completed 14 of 21 passes for 207 yards and was not intercepted. He lost one fumble, but the Saints couldn't cash in. 

___ 

RAIDERS 37, RAVENS 33 

OAKLAND, Calif. - Derek Carr threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Seth Roberts with 26 seconds left to cap the most productive day of his young career and lead Oakland. 

Carr threw for a career-high 351 yards and three touchdowns and overcame a late interception that put the Raiders (1-1) in a hole in the closing minutes. 

But Carr went 7 for 9 for 65 yards on the winning drive, aided by a personal foul on Timmy Jernigan and a hold on Will Hill III that negated an interception. 

Joe Flacco threw for 384 yards and two scores for the Ravens (0-2). 

___ 

VIKINGS 26, LIONS 16 

MINNEAPOLIS - Adrian Peterson had 192 total yards and Minnesota rebounded from a rough season opener. 

Peterson, playing in front of a pro-Vikings crowd for the first time in 658 days, rushed 29 times for 134 yards after receiving a pregame standing ovation out of the tunnel and a couple of ""AP! AP! AP!"" chants from the fans on a sun-soaked afternoon.

e4176ba8-84f0-45a1-ad73-86dd11ec0c2c,"Mexican authorities have arrested 13 more suspects in connection with the prison break of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, the country's attorney general's office said. 
 
Guzman, sometimes branded as the world's biggest drug lord and who is also wanted in the United States, made a well-planned, elaborate escape on July 11. He dropped through a hole in a shower into a mile-long tunnel equipped with a modified motorcycle, lighting and ventilation, and has not been officially spotted since. 

It was his second escape from a maximum security prison. After his first escape in 2001, it took Mexican law enforcement 13 years to catch up with him. 

His July disappearance from Altiplano prison and revelations by an investigative reporter have left a trail of accusations of collusion in the escape of the man nicknamed ""Shorty"" for his stature. 

Six days after his escape, seven prison workers were charged in connection with it. 

The new arrests include three high officials from the federal prison system, sources close to the attorney general's offices said. 

Celina Oseguera was a coordinator for the prison system, and Valentin Cardenas Lerma and Leonor Garcia were directors at Altiplano prison, where ""El Chapo"" was held, the sources said. 

The drug lord walked into the shower of his cell then disappeared out of sight of a surveillance camera watching him. It took guards 18 minutes to arrive at his cell after losing view of him. Nearly another half hour passed before his escape was alerted. 

Mexico's interior ministry suspected prison workers helped make the break possible. 

A local journalist, citing investigation documents she obtained, reported that officials had plenty of forewarning that Guzman, who has headed the Sinaloa drug cartel, was planning an escape. 

The government knew as far back as March that Guzman's people were studying blueprints of the prison, Anabel Hernandez reported. Prisoners complained of excessive noise that sounded like construction work. 

The documents were a collection of statements from interrogations. Mexico's federal attorney general's office declined to comment at the time, citing the ongoing investigation. 

Sinaloa drug cartel has supplied much of the marijuana, cocaine and heroin sold on U.S. streets. Forbes magazine once estimated ""El Chapo's"" fortune at $1 billion.

___ 
 
EAST BEASTS 
 
The Blue Jays and Yankees continue a pivotal AL East series with a doubleheader at Yankee Stadium. In Game 2, Toronto RHP Marcus Stroman will make his season debut after having surgery to repair a torn ACL in his left knee in March. New York will be without first baseman Mark Teixeira, who will miss the rest of the season because of a broken right leg. 
 
HOME, SWEET HOME 
 
Marlins RHP Jose Fernandez, returning from a right biceps strain that has sidelined him since Aug. 7, will try to become only the third pitcher since 1914 to win his first 16 career home decisions. Fernandez (4-0, 2.30 ERA) is 15-0 at Marlins Park with a 1.14 ERA. He has made just seven starts this year since returning from Tommy John surgery. RHP Tanner Roark (4-4, 4.41) starts for the Nationals. 
 
.500 DAYS IN SUMMER? 
 
The Indians are a win shy of .500 (69-70) for the first time since they were 2-2 in early April. They will try to even up their record against the Tigers after the teams were rained out on Friday. Cody Anderson (3-3, 3.72) goes against Justin Verlander (3-7, 3.34), who is 2-3 with a 1.27 ERA in his last six starts. 
 
SURGING SOX 
 
The disappointing Red Sox still have a realistic shot to finish third in the AL East and could help their cause during a three-game set at Tampa Bay this weekend. Boston's Rick Porcello (7-12, 5.12) has been dominant since coming off the disabled list following a bout with right triceps inflammation, a big turnaround for the offseason trade acquisition who signed a four-year extension in April. 
 
HANGING IN 
 
The struggling Angels, trying to stay alive in the AL West, play the middle game in a key three-game series against the first-place Astros. Hector Santiago (8-9, 3.24) goes for Los Angeles. The All-Star had lost five straight decisions before going six innings in a 7-0 win over Texas his last time out.

---------- 

Unique High-Filler Technology Will Provide Significant Cost Savings in Reduced Fiber Consumption by Increasing PCC Filler Usage 20% 

 ---------- 

NEW YORK, September 10-Minerals Technologies Inc. (NYSE: MTX) announced today that it has signed another commercial agreement with a prestigious global paper producer to provide Fulfill® E-325, a high-filler technology, at the paper company's mill in North America. This is the second agreement for the deployment of the FulFill® technology at this paper mill. 

Minerals Technologies now has 22 agreements with paper mills for adoption of the Fulfill® high-filler technology portfolio that the company introduced in late 2010. The agreement with this papermaker, which wishes to remain unnamed for competitive reasons, marks MTI's eighth in North America.  

These agreements confirm the commercial progress of the Fulfill® brand, a portfolio of high-filler technologies that offers papermakers a variety of efficient, flexible solutions that decreases dependency on natural fiber and reduces costs. The Fulfill® portfolio  allows papermakers to increase loading levels of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), which replaces higher cost pulp, and increases PCC usage up to 30 percent and higher. 

""The second adoption of this technology by this global papermaker at this facility illustrates its continued acceptance and reaffirms our commitment to advance our technology leadership throughout our satellite network around the world,"" said Joseph C. Muscari, chairman and chief executive officer.  

""Adopting the FulFill® E-325 technology will allow this prestigious paper to produce quality paper at lower cost by replacing higher-cost fiber with PCC from our satellite plant at this paper mill,"" said W. Rand Mendez, senior vice president & managing director, Paper PCC. 

PCC is a specialty pigment for filling and coating high-quality paper. By substituting Minerals Technologies' PCC for more expensive wood fiber, customers are able to produce brighter, higher quality paper at lower cost. In 1986, Minerals Technologies originated the satellite concept for making and delivering PCC on-site at paper mills and the concept was a major factor in revolutionizing papermaking in North America. Today, the company has 64 satellite plants in operation or under construction around the world and continues to lead the industry with consistent quality and technical innovation. 

New York-based Minerals Technologies Inc. is a resource- and technology-based growth company that develops, produces and markets worldwide a broad range of specialty mineral, mineral-based and synthetic mineral products and related systems and services. MTI serves the paper, foundry, steel, environmental, energy, polymer and consumer products industries. The company reported sales of $1.725 billion in 2014.

a provider of automation software for modeling, building and extending
data warehouses and analytic systems, announced today that Canadian
National Railways and Union Bank will present WhereScape automation use
cases next week at TDWI
San Diego . 

On Tuesday, Sept. 22, Alain Bond, business intelligence manager for
Canadian National Railways, will present Canadian
National Railways Rides Automation to Better Customer Service and Safety at the TDWI Executive Summit. According to Bond, in every organization,
there is some degree of shadow IT within business units that are driven
to deliver point solutions faster than IT typically delivers. Bond is
leading a group at Canadian Railway that is using WhereScape RED,
WhereScape’s flagship automation software for iterative rapid
prototyping within its agile methodology and will discuss how this
“alternate development path” is expediting “game-changing” development
at Canadian Railway. 

According to Bond, this path “should not be a slow and procedural
process requiring tons of upfront documents and analysis before even
showing any glimpse of value to our end users.” Canadian Railway’s
successes using WhereScape RED have been so great that Bond has
proclaimed that “ETL development as we know it is dead.” Even more
significant is the fact that more timely access to data will enable
Canadian Railway to further improve customer service and safety. 

On Thursday, Sept. 24, Ryan Fenner, vice president of enterprise
architecture for Union Bank, will present how WhereScape RED is enabling
his organization to tailor analytics implementations to their individual
needs in his case study entitled, Data
Analytics Federation vs. Centralization: When and Where It Makes Sense .
Union Bank is presently formulating a plan to centralize key analytics
teams, technologies, and processes. Fenner’s compelling use case will
walk attendees through Union Bank’s journey and the guidelines used to
make decisions on where and when to centralize these functions, and to
what extent. Union Bank uses WhereScape RED in its Greenplum and
Microsoft SQL Server enterprise data warehouse and shadow IT
environments. 

 Build a Data Warehouse in Two Hours with WhereScape RED  

WhereScape will host a TDWI Hands-On Lab on Wednesday, Sept. 23
entitled, Data
Warehouse Automation: Build a Fully Functional, Documented Data
Warehouse in 2 Hours! Whether a development team is building its
first enterprise data warehouse, business-targeted data marts, a tier of
reporting services, or the renovation or migration of an existing
warehouse or mart, WhereScape RED provides a compelling automation
alternative to complex and expensive do-it-yourself development
environments. 

According to TDWI, building a data warehouse is among the most
labor-intensive and time-consuming activities of BI development. There
are so many moving parts—requirements, source data analysis,
source-target mapping, data acquisition, data transformation logic, ETL
design, database loading, scheduling, error handling—and getting it
right the first time isn’t easy. When organizations finally do get it
right, something changes. 
 
“Attendees of this fast-paced, hands-on lab will learn first-hand how to
greatly accelerate data warehouse and analytic platform development and
change cycles while simultaneously assuring quality and consistency,”
said WhereScape President Mark Budzinski. “The productivity improvements
of up to 10x afforded by WhereScape RED enables organizations to deliver
accurate data to the business faster than ever thought possible.” 

 About WhereScape

The federation was founded on democratic principles that supported individual rights. Our history books depict the socio-political crossroads our forefathers faced. 
 
They defeated tyranny, unfairness and rose up to the challenge of preserving our way of life in a country so divided by centuries of colonial masters. But what made Malaysia unique was that our country had always been the region’s great hope – our neighbours saw opportunity, abundance and prosperity no other country had. 
 
We understand patriotism as the love of one’s country and the devotion that comes with it. 
 
It presents a strong sense of unity while upholding beliefs that national independence is essential for the protection of Malaysians and our way of life. And while a person can be patriotic towards the country where he or she is a citizen or permanent resident, sometimes having this sense of patriotism isn’t about the devotion one has towards a particular ruling government. 
 
Citizens may experience the devastating effects of living in a government that has strayed from the core principles that once built a nation. 
 
In this sense, opposing tyranny, corruption and urging the return to the federation’s founding principles may be seen as a symbol of patriotism. 
 
In most cases – if not all – citizens who are treated as second-class will also have differing definitions, different from those who are given preferential treatment. 
 
Members of the oppressed class, for example, might not embody patriotism towards their country the same way as members of other classes but might express hopes for socio-political reforms. 
 
Patriotism should never be about blind trust in anything our leaders tell us to do. Showing up to vote once every four of five years doesn’t define patriotism, and it definitely takes more than just waving the Jalur Gemilang once a year. 
 
It isn’t about themes and slogans but entails something more profound. Some Malaysians may have expressed feelings of patriotism only because they felt compelled or perhaps experienced some form of peer pressure. 
 
Who knows? But the truth is, there are no differences in bravery, decency, respect, love and humility; these values exist inside every single human being. 
 
When these values begin to wane and falter, this indicates the failure of leaders to nurture these values and foster them among citizens. 
 
For Malaysians, amid the repeated confusion and antagonism of political disagreements, patriotism continues to be something that has the ability to unite Malaysians, especially in times of national crisis and even triumphant victory. 
 
Call it liberty or freedom, call it optimism, even. For us living in the present, we will need to understand what being a Malaysian patriot is about so we can begin to educate our future generation about its guiding principles. 
 
What we think, do and say today will have an effect on our country’s performance and outcome. 
 
Loving Malaysia even with all the present flaws in the system often results in the determination that our nation will one day see the socio-political reforms we yearn for – and that, my fellow Malaysians, is what patriotism should mean. 
 
This makes life worth living, worth fighting and worth dying for. And this is the greatest hope for humankind.

They were freed after two Taliban suicide bombers targeted the main gates of a jail near the city of Ghazni – with gunmen storming inside and killing at least four prison guards. 
 
Roads to the prison were laced with landmines before the attack, and an army vehicle was blown up as it tried to reach the area and offer reinforcements. 
 
According to Ghazni’s deputy city governor, more than 400 prisoners had escaped overall, but 80 were quickly recaptured in the early hours of Monday morning. 
 
Of the remaining 352 inmates, approximately 150 are Taliban fighters – including “important military mujahideen officials”, a spokesman for the extremist group said. 
 
Zabihullah Muhajid also claimed 40 Afghan soldiers and guards were killed in the prison break, but the Taliban is known to exaggerate death numbers in their statements. 
 
Taliban insurgents have attacked jails on several occasions to free hundreds of inmates and many of the prisons suffer from poor security, with untrained and poorly equipped police guarding crumbling facilities. 
 
The prison in Ghazni, about 75 miles away from Kabul, had been adapted from a mud fort. 
 
Afghanistan’s government has recently suffered setbacks in their attempts to secure peace talks, with a string of deadly attacks across the country. 
 
The Taliban want to overthrow President Ashraf Ghani’s administration, which is backed by foreign leaders, and expel foreign military forces currently based in the country.

Inspired by the BURGER KING® brand’s Black Burger in Japan, which 
      created buzz worldwide, the Halloween WHOPPER® sandwich has a look 
      that’s curious to the eye, while the A.1. bun’s flavor is familiar and 
      savory to the palate. The A.1. smoky black pepper flavor is baked right 
      into the bread. Layered between the buns is savory flame-grilled beef 
      topped with melted American cheese, ripe tomatoes, fresh lettuce, creamy 
      mayonnaise, A.1.® Thick and Hearty Sauce, crunchy pickles, and sliced 
      white onions. 
 
“Our U.S. guests have been extremely curious about the bun flavors 
      they’ve seen introduced in Japan and other countries, so we saw the 
      opportunity to bring them an equally unique experience,” said Eric 
      Hirschhorn, Chief Marketing Officer, for the BURGER KING® Brand North 
      America. “We tailored the flavor of the black bun to the American palate 
      with A.1. sauce, a flavor this country loves, and we’re delivering it in 
      a way that’s never been done before by baking it into the bun. It may 
      look Japanese but it tastes like America.” 
 
This scary good burger will be available for a limited time at 
      participating restaurants nationwide while supplies last for the 
      suggested price of $4.99.

 San Diego, CA (PRWEB)  September 09, 2015  

Prodea Systems announced today from the Connected Health Summit that it has entered into a strategic partnership with Eocene Systems that will see Prodeas Residential Operating System (ROS®) distributed through its channels to healthcare organizations across the United States that are at risk for patients health and expenditures including, but not limited to Medicare, Commercial Insurance Companies, Accountable Care Organizations, Physician Groups and Disease Management Organizations. With an addressable market of over seventy million patients, the partnership will initially target one million across Eocenes existing customers.  This partnership underscores Prodeas emergence into the eHealth vertical, with the remote management of patients through connected devices and technology. 
 
With growing concerns over the long term costs of chronic disease management and its impact on the medical infrastructure, healthcare providers are searching for solutions that can both actively engage patients in their care as well as empower physicians with the tools they need to better manage these conditions on a real-time basis. Historically, physicians have lacked the capability to link with their patients on a real-time basis around their chronic illness, and to create meaningful outcomes in the lives of these individuals. In response to this need, Eocene saw technology as a way to create a link between their management systems, the cloud, and the patient, through the use of Prodeas innovative platform that bridges the gap and provides a seamless integrated approach to this problem. 

Introducing Prodeas ROS® Targeted Healthcare Platform 

 
The first-of-its-kind in healthcare market, Prodeas ROS® solution has been designed specifically to address the complex challenges that healthcare providers are experiencing, while at the same time, effectively addressing the needs of the patients and providing them effective tools such as: 

    Enable medical professionals to leverage real time and continuous data and communicate important health information to their patients around the management of their long-term chronic diseases.      Engage a patient with important health information, via media channels they prefer, within the comfort of their own home or on the go (i.e., Television, Smart phone, Tablet or PC) to ensure that critical information is delivered in real-time regarding the patients health.  This enables the patient to be proactive about managing their illness.      Easily, rapidly and cost-effectively integrate into patients lifestyles by delivering autonomous, agnostic and easy to use connectivity between patients, their health data and the medical infrastructures supporting them.  
The growing problem of chronic diseases requires consistent patient monitoring that goes beyond the traditional paradigm that we see today, said Anousheh Ansari, CEO of Prodea Systems. In order to make patients lives and care better, we must utilize new innovative technology in order to provide a new level of care that both doctors and patients can rely on. Ansari said. We are very proud of our partnership with Eocene and creating a tangible example of what The Internet of Things truly means  in this case how we will positively impact and benefit society with our human centric technology. 
 
We are thrilled to partner with Prodea, said Bryan Sowards, CEO of Eocene Systems. Prodeas ROS platform provides the critical technological solution that no one else in the industry has been able to develop. Their platform enables us to go that last mile into the patients home and not only capture diagnostic data, but truly engage with the patient, fostering changes in their behavior and ultimately helping them live a healthier lifestyle.  Utilizing the ROS platform, we can we deliver a fully integrated solution to healthcare providers tasked with managing patients outside the clinical environment. Eocene prides itself on solving complex customer problems and delivering a best in class product. With Prodea, we felt it was a perfect fit for continuing to deliver excellence to our customers.

ae70cb6c-fe26-4457-8a09-0ea08d184daf,"The Immigration Department (ImmD) recently reviewed relevant arrangements and conducted investigations regarding parents who have not registered births of children within the prescribed time limit.

Under the prevailing mechanism, if parents fail to register the birth of their child within the prescribed time limit, ImmD will send reminder letters to their last known address three, six and nine months after the birth of the child by ordinary and then registered mail to remind them of their duty to register the birth of their child as soon as possible. During the period, ImmD will attempt to contact the parents through other means if considered necessary. If the parents concerned are yet to be reached or the birth registration records are outstanding after repeated reminders, the cases will be forwarded to the Investigation Division for follow-up. ImmD will consider bringing prosecution against related persons for their failure to comply with the duty of registering the birth of their child as stipulated in the Births and Deaths Registration Ordinance (Cap. 174). 

Given the circumstances, ImmD has retrieved case records and 55 cases require further investigation. ImmD has attempted to contact the parents by phone and through home visits. In 22 of these cases, ImmD has been able to locate the parents and is arranging for the post-registrations of birth for their children. Investigations on 10 cases have been completed and ImmD is seeking legal advice on prosecution matters. The remaining 12 cases are still under investigation. As for the other 33 cases, ImmD will continue its efforts to contact the parents and investigate the cases. If no connections can be established, ImmD will place the parents particulars into its computer system so that, when they use the services of ImmD in the future, their contact method can be secured for follow-up action. When necessary, ImmD will also seek assistance from the Police for locating the persons with no known trace. 

An ImmD spokesman said today (September 16), Under the Births and Deaths Registration Ordinance, parents of every child born shall apply for the registration of the childs birth at a birth registry within a period of 42 days after birth. It is an offence if anyone deliberately fails to register the birth of a child as required by the law. Offenders are liable to a maximum penalty of a $2,000 fine or up to six months imprisonment.

The spokesman added, Parents must fulfil their obligations under the law to register the birth of a child so that the rights to medical treatment, education and welfare benefits entitled to their children are not harmed due to delay in following the relevant procedures. style=""display:block""

At the 14th International Conference on Endothelin: Physiology, Pathophysiology, and Therapeutics, researchers presented data on treatment of Alzheimer's dementia in rats with IRL-1620, a chemical that binds to endothelin B receptors. 
 
Previous studies had shown endothelin B receptors were important in brain development. Researchers set out to stimulate endothelin B receptors by intravenous (IV) injection of IRL-1620 to prevent and repair damage to the brain. When they administered IRL-1620 in rats with Alzheimer's dementia, they saw an improvement in memory deficit by 50–60% and a reduction in oxidative stress by 45–50%. Treatment with IRL-1620 boosted certain recovery processes within the damaged brain, which resulted in more new blood vessels and neuronal cells.

218018bd-233d-433c-8551-fa0c161d2b1c,"AUSTRALIA Post has notched up its first full year loss in more than 30 years. 

THE national postal service has posted a $222 million loss after tax for 2014/15, compared to a $116.2 million profit a year ago. 

Australia Post blamed a continual decline in letter volumes for the weak result. 

Letter volumes fell 7.3 per cent with losses in the mail business growing to $381 million as Australians switch to digital alternatives, Australia Post said in a statement. 

However, that was offset by parcel revenue which rose 3.6 per cent to $3.21 billion. 

And for the first time, parcels made up more than half of the group's revenue of $6.37 billion, which remained stable with the previous year. 

Australia Post managing director and chief executive Ahmed Fahour said it had been a challenging year for the business and the letters service was undergoing an important transformation.

""We are confident we have the resources, infrastructure and support in place to manage the ongoing transition of our letters business as we become a more eCommerce-centric organisation.""

     Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal projected the 0.1% increase. 
 

     The index, comprised of 10 components including weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, building permits and the S&P 500's price change, is meant to signal swings in the business cycle and smooth out some of the volatility of individual components. 
 

     The August index ""suggests economic growth will remain moderate into the new year, with little reason to expect growth to pick up substantially,"" said Ataman Ozyildirim, director of business cycles and growth research at the board. 
 

     While average working hours and new orders in manufacturing have been weak, pointing to continued slow growth in the industrial sector, rising employment, personal income, and manufacturing and trade sales have helped to offset weakness in industrial production, the board said. 
 

     The coincident index, which comprises four series including nonfarm payrolls and reflects current economic conditions, also rose 0.1% last month. The gauge decelerated from July's 0.4% rate, which was revised higher from an initial 0.2% print. Growth in the coincident index usually follows the rate of the leading index with a lag.

ff9c192f-9030-4fe3-a565-77e8c9baefb5,"Worries over fundamentalist Islam has reached its highest point since shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, according to a survey released Tuesday by the Chicago Council on Public Affairs. 
 
The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, is fueling the concern, the poll found. More than half – 55 percent – of Americans said they viewed Islamic fundamentalism as a critical threat, a 15 percent increase since last year. 
 
While concern about terrorist attacks rose six percentage points from 2014 to this year – from 63 percent to 69 percent --, Americans' worries over terrorism are still lower than they were between 2002 and 2010. For example, 91 percent of Americans viewed terrorism as a critical threat in 2002. 
 
A terrorist attack on the United States by Islamic extremists was viewed as a critical threat by 72 percent of respondents, ahead of the 69 percent who described international terrorism as a critical threat. ISIS and other extremist groups were cited as a critical threat by 64 percent of those polled. 
 
The poll also found Americans are increasingly in favor, albeit slightly, of various military actions to confront terrorism. Support for U.S. air strikes against terrorist training camps and other facilities rose from 71 percent in 2014 to 77 percent this year, while 73 percent of Americans said they support targeted assassinations of terrorist leaders, compared to 70 percent in 2014. 
 
Islamic extremism was also blamed for Middle East terrorism. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said Islamic extremism contributes ""a great deal"" to Middle East terrorism while only 20 percent said the ideology contributes ""a fair amount"" to the turmoil. 
 
A plurality – 47 percent – said Middle Eastern authoritarian regimes that violate human rights contribute ""a great deal"" to terrorism while 34 percent said those governments contribute ""a fair amount"" to terrorism. 
 
The Chicago Council on Public Affairs survey was conducted between May 25 and June 17 and polled 2,034 adults.

123709ab-8a06-4bc1-9d9e-47139179c8bd,"Mumbai: Political acrimony over the ban on meat by civic bodies in Mumbai during the Jain fasting days grew with ruling BJP ally Shiv Sena on Wednesday vowing that it would ensure there is no such restriction. 

The Sena's stand came in the wake of Opposition Congress and NCP slamming the order by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) -- ruled by Sena and BJP -- prohibiting meat sale for eight days from September 11 to 18 when the Jain community will observe fasting period 'Paryushan'. According to the order, the ban would be enforced on four days - September 10, 13, 17 and 18. 

However, the NCP-controlled Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation also announced suspension of sale of meat till September 17 in view of 'Paryushan', though the party had yesterday joined the Congress in voicing reservation over it. 

Taking a strident position on the matter, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray said, ""We will ensure there is no ban on sale of meat for the eight days."" Interestingly, Sena is the dominant partner in BMC where it shares power with BJP. 

The BJP, which has pressed for the ban, held that the decision was taken by the civic bodies and the state government has no role in it. The NCP had voiced reservation over the ban order on Tuesday, with the party along with Congress dubbing it as a BJP ploy to polarise voters with an eye on the elections to the civic body due in early 2017. 

The ward officer of A ward in Navi Mumbai said in a statement that there will be no sale of meat from today till September 17. BMC recently announced suspension of meat sale and shutting down of its slaughter house at Deonar in suburban Mumbai on September 10, 13, 17 and 18 in deference to the sentiments of the Jain community members, who during 'Paryushan' even shun all root vegetables. 

The ban covers mutton and chicken, and excludes fish and eggs. It also extends to private businesses selling raw meat. The ban on sale of meat during 'Paryushan' has been in force since 1964, when the BMC passed a resolution directing a two-day prohibition on sale of meat in response to the demands by Jains, a powerful community which holds key stakes in business and industry in Mumbai. 

In 2004, the Congress-NCP government passed another resolution extending it by another two days across Mumbai every September. 

The BMC ban on meat came close on the heels of the adjoining Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation, where the BJP has an upper hand, passing a resolution to ban sale of meat in the satellite town's civic markets for the entire 'Paryushan' season. 

Supporting the ban, Manoj Kotak, BJP leader in the BMC, said, ""Lord Mahavir is an avatar of Vishnu. If the Jain community feels that harming animals will hurt the community's sentiments during 'Paryushan', then what is wrong in demanding a ban? When people refrain from drinking liquor on October 2, do politicians question their decision?"" 

The Opposition Congress and NCP had yesterday slammed the decision to ban meat sale during the upcoming fasting period of Jains in Mumbai and neighbouring Mira Bhayander, saying BJP-Shiv Sena were trying to ""polarise"" voters ahead of municipal corporation polls. The BMC elections are due February 2017, a crucial battle for the main political players in the state. 

State NCP president Sunil Tatkare had said the government should have taken a decision by consensus respecting the sentiments of Jains and also ensuring that rest of the society is not hurt.","Won't allow meat ban in Mumbai, says Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav",News,Deccan Chronicle,2015-09-09T13:42:51Z
39f78d51-f837-447b-b73b-f408b9d10925,"England faltered to a 59-run defeat in the first Royal London Series match against Australia as Matthew Wade's bustling batsmanship proved decisive at the Ageas Bowl. 
 
		 
Australia needed Wade and Mitch Marsh's unbroken century stand for the seventh wicket to keep them competitive, following their mid-innings stumble to Adil Rashid (four for 59). 
   
Then England's attempt to chase 305 for six fizzled out under lights as they too lost quick wickets when they could least afford to - their last eight for 94 to end up 246 all out with 4.3 overs unused. 

			 
There was a half-century at the top of the order for the tourists from David Warner (59), but it was Wade's unbeaten 71 from number seven which proved telling after Steve Smith had chosen to bat under cloud cover. 



 
On a pitch of decent pace, and a characteristically quick outfield at this venue, Rashid and the wicketless Chris Woakes were the pick of England's bowlers. 

Among their batsmen, opener Jason Roy (67) hit a heartening maiden fifty - but the hosts could not sustain their effort as this year's World Cup winners prevailed again to go 1-0 up with four to play. 

Australia laid the most conventional of platforms to set a score, reaching the 30-over mark on 155 for two. 

Joe Burns poked a full toss back at Rashid after putting on 76 with Warner. 

			 
Then Rashid did the trick again with the second delivery of his second spell, Warner giving himself room to drive a googly through the off-side but edging the attempted big hit to short third man. 

Rashid continued his golden-arm day when Smith hit another full toss straight to deep mid-wicket, but the leg-spinner could claim more credit for pinning George Bailey lbw on the back foot. 

That was three wickets in 19 balls for Rashid, and when Mark Wood got in on the act - Glenn Maxwell caught behind down the leg-side - Australia's plan to keep batting resources intact for a late onslaught had misfired. 

From the last ball of Rashid's 10 overs, there was another home success - Shane Watson run out responding to a faulty single into the off-side called by Wade, as the tourists' troubles extended to the loss of four wickets for 29. 

			 
But Wade made up for his early own goal in a half-century of rasping cuts and effective scurry which arrived in just 40 balls, after he had taken nine to get off the mark. 

The wicketkeeper's partnership of 112 with Marsh included 93 in the last 10 overs. 

Roy and Alex Hales gave England's reply a highly encouraging start, taking heavy toll of an initially off-colour Mitchell Starc. 

Hales found little of the strike, though, and met a tame end with a pull to mid-wicket off Marsh. 

Roy too, after a fine maiden half-century in international cricket which came at better than a run a ball and contained much sweet timing among 10 boundaries, went in anti-climax when he chipped a catch to point in the first over of off-spin from Maxwell. 

			 
The recalled James Taylor appeared set to play a significant hand, with some typically busy shots and running, until he went one short of his fifty - bowled aiming to leg, up the wicket to Watson. 

Starc returned to present much more of a threat with the older ball, in a three-over second spell which cost just six runs and also did for Ben Stokes who chipped a catch to mid-wicket. 

But it was the loss of three wickets for no runs in four balls which stopped England in their tracks. 

Eoin Morgan gloved behind, trying to pull Watson; then Jos Buttler drove Nathan Coulter-Nile to mid-off, and Woakes went first ball to the same bowler - also edging a pull to Wade - to make it 194 for seven. 

England had no Wade or Marsh ready to bail them out, so it was game over. 

:: England have added left-arm seamer Reece Topley to their squad for the remaining four matches in the series.

Oakland, California (PRWEB) September 01, 2015 

Zoomita, a free college planning tool focused on application essays, is now used by tens of thousands of students in over 9,000 high schools. The site launched last November. 

Zoomita tracks around 7,000 essay prompts and word count limits for over a thousand of the most applied-to colleges. It works by calculating the total number of required and optional essays for each school on a student’s college list. Students can then create a summary of all the requirements or browse by school, allowing them to quickly gauge how much time it will take to apply to their chosen schools. Students can also write and share their essays directly in the app, which organizes every draft in chronological order by prompt, without the need for files and folders. 

“Application essays are hard. They take a lot of time, are anxiety-provoking, and are probably the single greatest source of inequality in college admissions. It’s exciting to build something that makes that process a little easier and more transparent,” said Alex Thaler, Founder and CEO.

The company is currently finalizing the production of “Essay Brilliance,” an online course on application essays scheduled for release in September. Next steps for the company also include a crowdsourcing feature that will allow students to test their drafts with other users in a plagiarism-free environment. Zoomita users already have free access to “The Art of the Personal Statement,” a step-by-step guide featuring introductions by Deans of Admission at University of Pennsylvania and UC Berkeley, as well as sample essays. 

Zoomita’s sister site, Edswell, offers a counselor-facing tool built on the same technology. In Edswell, all student accounts are connected to a counselor account that includes class-management and student-tracking features. It is currently used by hundreds of counselors and high schools around the world.

0ed93e44-d81c-40ed-9abc-1dd9cee607e1,"Behind Jeff Gillman’s quizzical but friendly smile lurks a fearless garden warrior, ready to take on bogus advice and dubious garden practices. 

“No more mulch volcanoes around trees,” exclaims Gillman, UNC Charlotte Botanical Garden’s new director. “I couldn’t believe that after we moved here. And no more crepe murder, either.” 

Crepe murder is gardening slang for mercilessly amputating the limbs of crepe myrtle trees, leaving ugly stumps, a practice that’s botanically unnecessary and potentially harmful. 

Gillman, 45, brings a national reputation to Charlotte as a bestselling garden writer, a contributing editor at Fine Gardening Magazine, a founder of gardenprofessors.com , and a regular on the popular indie garden blog, GardenRant.com. 

Gillman has appeared on “The Martha Stewart Show,” talking about his best-known book, “The Truth About Garden Remedies.” 

As Gillman told journalist Meleah Maynard, something inside him snapped when, as a young horticulture professor at the University of Minnesota, he heard a nationally know garden guru dispensing tips on TV that he thought were nonsensical. 

“I was so offended I immediately started researching some of his claims,” Gillman recalls, and his bestseller was born. 

Gillman earned his Ph.D. in horticulture at the University of Georgia, where his adviser was Michael Dirr, himself a nationally recognized expert. 

The charismatic Dirr converted Gillman from a career path in entomology. Gillman had wanted to be an entomologist from the time he was a kid, growing up on a farmstead in Pennsylvania. 

His father, a chemist, grew a small orchard near the house, and Gillman watched what happened the years they sprayed and the ones they didn’t. Always a pragmatist, he became adept at digging worms out of the apples in the nonspray years. 

“I’m no entomologist,” he now says, smiling, “ though I can tell a fly from a bee, and that can be helpful.” 

Not one to put on airs, Gillman has set up shop in a corner of UNC Charlotte’s busy greenhouse workroom, dusting off an old desk across from the potting bench. He says he is grateful to be surrounded by exceptional co-workers and a wonderful collection of plants, the legacy of past director Larry Mellichamp. 

Gillman’s right-hand adviser, veteran Botanical Garden Assistant Director Paula Gross, is also an old friend. They were graduate students together at Georgia. Another local connection is UNC Charlotte political science professor Eric Heberlig, Gillman’s undergraduate college roommate at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania, and his co-author on “How the Government Got in Your Backyard: Superweeds, Frankenfoods, Lawn Wars, and the (Nonpartisan) Truth About Environmental Policies.” 

Gillman plans to use his writing and teaching expertise to spread the word about the Botanical Garden’s exceptional collections, which include orchids and tropical plants in the greenhouses, carnivorous plants, and enchanting rambling outdoor gardens. A new gem is the Mellichamp Native Terrace, spotlighting plants indigenous to North Carolina. 

Gillman and Gross plan to continue the popular plant sales – the next one is Oct. 16-17 – and classes, but they want to add other activities, as well. They are plotting strategy, beginning with careful planning, researching best practices at other botanical gardens throughout the Southeast. 

“The beautiful thing about UNC Charlotte is that our botanical garden is on campus.” Gillman says. “Our role here is to work with the urban environment, something different from Minnesota or UGA.” 

Charlotte managed to land Gillman in part because of another of his passions – his family. He enjoyed teaching at University of Minnesota, he said, but he and his wife decided to move with their two children closer to family in the Carolinas. 

Gillman took a position at CPCC’s Horticulture Technology program on the Cato Campus two years ago, where he was a popular and innovative teacher. When his dream job opened at UNCC, he couldn’t say no, he said. He praises CPCC as an excellent choice for horticulture students and a place where faculty truly care about their students. 

Gillman insists that those who offer garden advice back up their opinions with scientific evidence. To his credit, Gillman makes a point of testing garden advice himself. He’s ground up eggshells to see if they repel slugs (they don’t, but beer traps work), and sprayed organic clove oil on weeds (sometimes kills the tops but not the roots, and may be dangerous.) 

He even tested playing music to plants at University of Minnesota. His graduate student hated the experiment, complaining that she had to climb into a growth chamber to make measurements while the rock band Rush (Gillman’s choice) boomed from speakers. 

The results were inconclusive, but Gillman told journalist Maynard people should sing or talk to their plants if they want to: “I find it empowering to talk to things that won’t talk back.”",Jeff Gillman: A gardener’s eye view,News,Charlotte Observer,2015-09-16T15:06:42Z

ab6a214c-9cc0-4529-99ce-77c00c5be12d,"It’s one of the most dismaying poll results I’ve seen: In October 2008, a month before they elected him president, 12 percent of Americans thought Barack Obama was Muslim.  Seven years later, now that they know him better, 29 percent have the religion of their president wrong. During those seven years, Obama has done nothing to indicate he is anything other than the practicing Christian he’s always said he was. It’s not that he’s become more Muslim. It’s that Americans have gotten more stupid. Some things are matters of fact, and technology has made it easier than ever to confirm facts. But instead of getting everyone on the same page, technology – email, the Web, social media – has accelerated the distribution of myths, caricatures, falsehoods and lies. Call it the Misinformation Age. Ignorance isn’t new, of course. Seven percent of Americans think Elvis is alive and the moon landing was a hoax. But the persistence of untruths in the political sphere, among people supposedly paying attention, is a problem on many levels. Obama’s biography isn’t the only example. Al Gore never said he invented the Internet, a lie that has dogged him for decades. The most recent Republican presidential debate offered several untruths: Carly Fiorina misidentifying a grisly video – and challenging others to go watch it; Donald Trump peddling long-discredited links between vaccinations and autism; Jeb Bush praising his brother George W because “he kept us safe” – as if someone else was president when terrorists struck on Sept. 11, 2001. But the myths about Obama have a special persistence, including the much-discussed and much debunked fact of where he was born. I’ll risk being obvious, because apparently 20 percent of Americans require it: Obama was born in Honolulu in 1961. We’ve seen his birth certificate, of course. But his birth was also announced in the newspapers. Faking a birth certificate is hard; it’s even harder to falsify newspaper pages that have been on microfilm for 50 years. As for the president’s religion, Obama has told his story, and it has been confirmed by reporters and biographers: The grandfather he never met converted from animism to Islam but was not devout. The father he barely knew was an atheist. His mother and the grandparents who raised him were Unitarian Protestants. His Indonesian stepfather was a non-practicing Muslim. Obama converted to Christianity in 1988 and joined a Protestant church. Settling some disputes require both evidence and definitions. In common American usage, your religion is what you were brought up as, or the faith you choose and follow as an adult, taking its oaths, celebrating its sacraments, honoring its scriptures, and attending its services. Both point to Obama’s Christianity. He was not raised a Muslim and there’s no evidence that he acts like a Muslim in his religious life. So by the common American definition, he’s a Christian, not a Muslim. Page 2 of 2 - I’ve heard theories that purport to prove Obama is a secret Muslim, using some other definition of religious identification. But redefinition cannot change a fact. Nor can repeating a lie over and over again make it the truth. Unless it’s a lie people want to believe is the truth. A lot of Republicans prefer the lie: A recent CNN poll found 43 percent of registered Republicans think Obama is a Muslim, and among supporters of Donald Trump, the number grows to 54 percent. “A lie will go round the world while truth is pulling its boots on,” wrote 19th century humorist C.H. Spurgeon, a quote often wrongly attributed to Mark Twain. Even faster, he might add today, if it comes with a note line screaming “Forward to all your friends!” Today’s lies come with Photoshopped images of Obama dressed like a Islamic scholar and mash-up videos labeled “Obama Admits He Is a Muslim!” They are peddled relentlessly by websites that have incorporated conspiracy-mongering and partisan libels into their business models. But they are just as false as the rumors spread by political enemies about every president since Washington. The truth is out there, provided by credible fact-checking organizations, but truth has always been optional in politics. Stephen Colbert had it right on his very first show, when he coined the term “truthiness” to describe things that may not be true, but that FEEL like they should be true. For 29 percent of American voters, truthiness is good enough. Rick Holmes writes for GateHouse Media and the MetroWest Daily News. He can be reached at rholmes@wickedlocal.com.

We came together through the dream of Stan Gibson, a local musician, fan and compassionate humanitarian.  He created a Facebook page called, “Baltimore Bands from the 70s 80s 90s,” with the intention of bringing together musicians, fans, music venues and members of the vibrant golden age of LIVE music in the Baltimore Metro area.  With a little help from his friends, and over 6800 avid members, a virtual community was built and keeps growing.  With the tremendous success of the Facebook page, Stan dreamed of bringing the online community together in a live music event.  In October 2013, and November 2014, our first and second annual event, respectively, the dream was realized and came to be known as STANSTOCK!  The results produced over the past two events were beyond our imaginings.  Relationships were renewed as bands, fans and the nightclub community from “back in the day” were reunited.  More importantly, we met our fundraising objectives and presented all net proceeds to two charities, both years.  The dream continues.  All musicians gather together and donate their time and talents to this worthy cause along with the all-volunteer staff work on this project throughout the year.  Join us for STANSTOCK 2015! 

Stanstock is currently seeking corporate sponsors and live music venue partners to join in this musical journey and help support our cause.  We offer exposure to a distinct and active group of live local music fans, with sponsorship packages ranging from $350 for venue partners up to $4,000 for a presenting stage sponsor.  For more information about 2015 sponsorship opportunities contact Staci Samaras, 410-212-8083 or staci@ssrocks.com.

September 8, 2015 - As morcellator cancer lawsuits continue to be filed around the country, The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has agreed to investigate claims that laparoscopic power morcellators spread cancer during gynecological surgeries after a request from Congress. Southern Med Law continues to represent women across the country who are believed to have had undetected uterine cancer spread after gynecological procedures involving power morcellators and had filed and settled the first power morcellator cancer lawsuit in a U.S. federal court for an undisclosed amount. (In Re: Power Morcellator Litigation, MDL Case No. 78)

GAO’s managing director, Katherine Siggerud, sent a response on September 1 to U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), who led the12-member bipartisan Congressional group in asking for the probe. The GAO conducts investigations for the U.S. Congress. According to a report by Philly.com, Ms. Siggerud wrote, ""GAO accepts your request as work that is within the scope of its authority."" The legislators sent a letter to the GAO on August 7 noting that, ""hundreds, if not thousands, of women in America are dead"" because of power morcellators. The legislators asked the GAO to determine, among other things, whether the FDA’s expedited approval process for medical devices ""sufficiently identified"" the cancer risks before the power morcellators entered the marketplace.

""Southern Med Law looks forward to the outcome of the GAO’s investigation because the law firm is representing women who have been seriously or fatally injured allegedly by power morcellators,"" says Dr. François Blaudeau, founder of Southern Med Law. In July, Dr. Blaudeau settled the first power morcellator cancer lawsuit filed in federal court on behalf of a Pennsylvania widower, Scott Burkhart, whose wife, Donna Burkhart, 53, died of disseminated leiomyosarcoma in February 2013. Donna Burkhart developed the cancer after undergoing a power morcellator hysterectomy in March 2012. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, against morcellator manufacturers, LiNA Medical APS, Kebomed AB & LiNA Medical US. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount.(Case No. 5:14-cv-1557)

The law firm explains that laparoscopic power morcellators are used during a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) and a myomectomy (removal of uterine fibroids). The device grinds uterine tissue into pieces so that the fragments can be removed through small (laparoscopic) incisions in the abdomen. It is during the removal of uterine tissue that undetected cancer cells are spread into the peritoneal cavity.

In November 2014, the FDA warned that power morcellators should be avoided in the majority of women who require a hysterectomy and a myomectomy due to the medical device’s potential to spread undetected cancer cells which greatly reduced a woman’s chances for long-term survival. The law firm notes that after the FDA’s announcement, national health insurance companies including Aetna Inc. and UnitedHealth, announced that they would either end or restrict coverage for uterine morcellation procedures. Additionally, in the wake of the FDA’s warning, the FBI decided to investigate power morcellators. According to CBS News, the FBI’s probe includes questioning Johnson & Johnson, the largest power morcellator manufacturer, on what it knew about the cancer risks associated with the morcellators. Johnson & Johnson suspended global sales of the devices after the FDA’s warning.

Court documents indicate that the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) will hear oral arguments on October 1 on a request from six plaintiffs who filed a request to consolidate all federally filed power morcellator cancer lawsuits. The plaintiffs are asking the panel to transfer 22 pending morcellator lawsuits, and those that are subsequently filed, to the U.S. District Court, District of Kansas. The plaintiffs, who filed claims against various morcellator manufacturers, asked for a consolidation because all the complaints allege that power morcellators used during gynecological procedures can spread and upstage cancer.

If you’re a dedicated Suicide Squad fan who has closely watched this summer’s trailer for the upcoming film, then you might have noticed something odd about some of the footage. Though most of the shots show members of the team together, there are some solo shots of Cara Delevingne. In other words, because Delevingne is not featured with other members of the Squad, gossip websites are starting to muse that perhaps Develingne is the as-yet-unnamed villain of the movie, Screen Crush reports. Heroic Hollywood takes this theory even further and posits that the character the model/actress is playing is on a mission to locate and resurrect her dead brother in the hopes that they can destroy the world together. 

While this might sound far-fetched, it’s actually not. In the comics, an artsy girl named June Moone discovers an evil entity and absorbs its power, becoming the Enchantress. Because Delevingne is the only actor in the trailer not featured with other members of the Squad, by power of deduction, one could surmise that she’s probably the Enchantress. Especially given the way she’s depicted in the footage—we see her exploring a dark cavern, taking a bath in mucky water, and wearing a pentagram scrawled on her head—the rumor seems more than likely to be true. 

But I guess we’ll just have to wait until August 5, 2016 to find out for sure. ","Rumor has it that Cara Devilngne is the Main Villain in ""Suicide Squad""",News,Complex,2015-09-12T23:46:10Z

The head imam of the Estonian Muslim community, Ildar Muhamedšin, said there is no friction between Sunnis and Shiites in Estonia, adding that he hopes to co-operate with the state to better integrate any new Muslim migrants. 
  
A couple of hundred Muslims gathered at the Islamic center in Tallinn on Thursday for the beginning of Eid al-Adha – or Feast of Sacrifice – the second of two religious holidays celebrated by Muslims worldwide each year. In Islam, it honors the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son, as an act of submission to God's command, before God then intervened, through his angel Jibra'il and informs him that his sacrifice has already been accepted. 
 
“It is Islam's greatest religious holiday. The main meaning is that the pilgrimage to Mecca is coming to an end, and today the most important day is ending, the Arafah, and this what is being marked,” Kristi Ockba, a local Muslim, said. 
 
Sunnis and Shiites worship together in Estonia. “Thankfully we do not have differences, as our Islamic community unites all Muslims – we have Tatars, Azerbaijanis and other nationalities,” Muhamedšin said. 
 
He said any new Muslim migrants must be integrated, “We must teach them the real Islam, which is based on love of one another and genuine moral principles. For this reason, we, the Estonian Muslems, need the help of the state and we must cooperate,” he added. 
 
Timur Saripov, a board member of the Estonian Islamic community, said he has met the asylum seekers at Vao, adding that the migrants told him they do not want to stay in Estonia. “They see Estonia as a transit nations and are not interested in staying in Estonia. They say Vao has no jobs and they are primarily looking at Scandinavian nations – Sweden and Finland,” Saripov said.

So it's little wonder former Geordie Shore star Marnie Simpson, 23, wanted to let her hair down as she partied at the Jeans for Genes charity bash at London's Chinawhite on Wednesday night. 

But it seems that the reality star might have partied a little too hard as she was seen being carried out of the club by her pal Chloe Goodman, 21, before taking a rather dramatic tumble. 

   
   
Worse for wear: It's little wonder former Geordie Shore star Marnie Simpson, 23, wanted to let her hair down as she partied at the Jeans for Genes charity bash at London's Chinawhite on Wednesday night 
   
Down she goes! But it seems that the reality star might have partied a little too hard as she was seen being carried out of the club by her pal Chloe Goodman, 21, before taking a rather dramatic tumble  

The Geordie bombshell looked worse for wear as she clutched onto Ex On The Beach star Chloe for dear life while they walked through the city's Piccadilly Circus. 
 
After grabbing on the to Celebrity Big Brother contestant, Marnie - who wasn't wearing her engagement ring for her evening out - took a tumble on her towering platform heels.   

The Newcastle native, who held her gold iPhone close to her seemingly for fear of dropping it, then dragged her DJ pal Melissa Reeves down with her as she fell to the floor. 
   
Party animal: Marnie had a turbulent few weeks, so it's perhaps no wonder the reality star wanted to really let her hair down at the bash 
   
Oh dear: Marnie and DJ pal Melissa Reeves, who earlier in the evening partied at the Jeans for Genes party at Chinawhite, were spotted collapsing in a heap on the path as Chloe tried to help them up 

The pair were spotted collapsing in a heap on the path as Chloe tried to help them up. 

But it seems the trio weren't fazed by the drunken incident as they were later spotted laughing as they continued their night on the town. 

Marnie cut a more sophisticated figure earlier in the evening as she arrived at the charity party along with blonde Chloe, the pair posing up a storm in their matching denim. 
   
Poor Marnie: The Newcastle native has had a rough few weeks, with her with her puppy being taken to hospital and her relationship with ex-TOWIE star Ricky Rayment being plagued by cheating rumours 
   
Helping hand: Ex On The Beach star Chloe Goodman, 21, was seen trying to help Marnie and Melissa up from the wet street 
   
There we go: Luckily the pair didn't spend too much time on the ground, thanks to Chloe who helped them up 

The brunette looked stylish in a black trilby, along with a plunging, burgundy bodysuit which flaunted her cleavage. 

Marnie appeared to go braless in the revealing garment, which showcased her tanned skin from the back and a hint of side-boob. 

Getting into the denim spirit, she donned a pair of belted, stonewash, high-waisted skinny jeans, which flattered her figure. 
   
Laugh it off: It seems the trio weren't fazed by the drunken incident as they were later spotted laughing as they continued their night on the town 
   
Girls night out: The trio of beauties were seen falling over as they made their way through Piccadilly Circus, to Libertine in Oxford Circus 

She elongated her petite frame with a pair of black platform heels and accessorised with a black, fringed handbag, featuring a gold chain. 

The former reality star sported a full face of make-up for the London party, including lashings of black mascara, peachy blush and glossy nude lipstick. 

Chloe opted for double-denim, flashing her stomach in a denim shirt which was tied up at her waist, along with a pair of  skinny jeans, black heeled ankle boots and a multi-coloured Celine tote bag. 
   
Styling: Marnie elongated her petite frame with a pair of black platform heels and accessorised with a black, fringed handbag, featuring a gold chain 
   
You've got a friend:The pair's pal, DJ pal Melissa Reeves (L), flashed plenty of flesh in an abs-baring crop top with ripped skinny jeans 

The pair's pal, DJ pal Melissa Reeves, who appeared in the second series of Ex On The Beach, flashed plenty of flesh in an abs-baring crop top with ripped skinny jeans. 

Marnie's Geordie Shore co-stars, Charlotte Crosby, 25, and Holly Hagan, 23, were also seen at the party, flaunting their figures in their respective outfits. 

Meanwhile, it was confirmed on Thursday morning that Marnie's fiancé Ricky Rayment, 25, was arrested on suspicion of ABH (actual bodily harm) at the weekend. 

But Sussex Police told the MailOnline in a statement that he was de-arrested at the scene after the victim of the fight declined to give a statement to police.  
   
Fashionista: The brunette looked stylish in a black trilby, along with a plunging, burgundy bodysuit which flaunted her cleavage 
  
Daring: Marnie appeared to go braless in the revealing garment, which showcased her tanned skin from the back and a hint of side-boob 
   
Demure: Marnie cut a more sophisticated figure earlier in the evening as she arrived at the charity party along with blonde Chloe, the pair posing up a storm in their matching denim 

A spokesperson confirmed: 'A 25-year-old man from Chigwell in Essex was arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm following a fight with another man in Brighton in the early hours of Sunday morning (August 30). 

'Police officers on patrol in East Street were alerted to the fight near to the junction with Kings Road around 2.25am.  

'As the situation calmed, the victim of the assault declined to provide a statement and the man was de-arrested. He left the area immediately.' 

The news comes as Marnie and Ricky's relationship came under intense strain after rumours surfaced that she'd cheated on her partner during a night out in Newcastle. 
  
Monochrome: Geordie Shore star Holly Hagan flashed her cleavage in a plunging cream blouse with ripped black skinny jeans 

But it seems the pair may get their fairytale ending after all as the former TOWIE star recently broke his silence on split rumours, claiming 'it's lies'. 

The Essex lad - who spent his birthday without his fiancée in Thailand - took to Twitter to furiously deny the Geordie lass had cheated on him and that they've parted company as a result. 

Writing in response to a user who sarcastically expressed their shock at hearing Marnie was allegedly unfaithful, he said: 'No she didn't. It's lies.' 
  
Beauty: Geordie Shore's Charlotte Crosby looked lovely in a cream, lace-up top with denim cut-off shorts 
   
Co-stars: Marnie's Geordie Shore co-stars Charlotte and Holly cut very glamorous figures at the charity party at Chinawhite 

Ricky further vented on the social-media network, adding: 'All stories in magazine and papers are false. Until you get a quote from me personally, don't believe what you read (sic). 

'Unless the story comes from my mouth then don't believe a word the papers and magazine say (sic).' 

Marnie publicly backed her husband-to-be and explained the truth behind the cryptic 'heartbroken' tweet which initially prompted followers to think she and Ricky had called off their engagement. 

'I couldn't of ever imagined what this day would bring. My heart is broken,' (sic) she wrote on Sunday. 

Responding to tweet by a national newspaper which had a link to the split story attached, the raven-haired MTV star wrote: 'I was heart broken because my puppy almost died and was in hospital.' 

Marnie's management returned 'no comment' when approached by MailOnline and Ricky's reps are yet to respond.

c973f3ec-e4be-4ccb-8ce7-fb5b8a8bc4e3,"TOP chef Luke Dale-Roberts is to open a pop-up restaurant at Johannesburg’s The Saxon, the boutique hotel in Sandhurst, Sandton, said on Tuesday. 

This would not affect Dale-Roberts’ Cape Town restaurants, The Test Kitchen — which was placed 28th in this year’s S. Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants — and The Pot Luck Club. 

""It’s very exciting for us,"" said Saxon spokeswoman Nicolette Fortuin. 

The name, menu and decor of the new Dale-Roberts restaurant would be released closer to the establishment’s January 21 2016 launch, she said. 

Executive chef at The Saxon, the multi award-winning David Higgs, was leaving the hotel to open his own restaurant in Rosebank. Johannesburg, Fortuin said. Higgs has been at The Saxon since 2011. 

""Obviously it’s a terrific thing for Johannesburg,"" said food critic Anna Trapido. ""Luke Dale-Roberts and David Higgs are very interesting chefs in the fine dining genre. ...The question has always been why Johannesburg has all the money and all the expensive restaurants are in the Winelands and Cape Town. If you compare us to Brazil, Sao Paulo and Rio (de Janeiro), then Sao Paulo is Johannesburg and Rio is Cape Town. All the good Brazilian restaurants are in Sao Paulo."" 

Trapido said it was a myth that Johannesburg did not have ""fantastic"" food, but that — unlike Cape Town — Johannesburg’s best food spots were ""small, interesting, ethnic restaurants. I think you would struggle to find an excellent Congolese restaurant in Cape Town. We have loads of those."" 

Dale-Roberts’ contract with The Saxon was for a fully-functional lunch and dinner restaurant for ""three or four months"", Fortuin said. 

The Saxon quoted Dale-Roberts as saying: ""The Saxon is an iconic hotel and the perfect home for us to set up a new creative space. I'm excited to venture into the Joburg market and see how diners there react to The Test Kitchen style of food."" 

Higgs said his new establishment, opposite the Circa art gallery on Jan Smuts Avenue, Rosebank, would be open in March or April next year. He did not want to reveal any details now. 

""I have no desire to go back to Cape Town,"" said the chef, who has been in Johannesburg since 2011. ""I love the vibe here. The thing about Joburg is the idea that anything can work. I love that. I love that it (the city) travels at 100k (sic) an hour."" 

Higgs’ restaurant at The Saxon, Five Hundred, would continue under the guidance of head chef Candice Philip, Fortuin said. ""The culinary and service teams will remain the same.""

d3cdfb4d-dc59-42b4-bce3-d4fa49c12002,"Pregnancy is an amazing time in a woman’s life…I mean, she is creating a human being! How cool is that?! Her body changes a lot and is put through quite a bit in an effort to grow and prepare this tiny human being for entry into this world. Some of the things I love, others not so much (). 
 
As mentioned in my post on eating during pregnancy, I love working with pregnant mamas because they are usually the most motivated clients! They want to do all they can to make sure they are giving their baby the best shot at developing healthy and strong. Eating right is one of the best ways to do that, another is to exercise.  Being pregnant with my second child I, too, want to make sure I do all that I can to make sure he is healthy – which means making sure I am healthy. 
 
But what exercises can you do while pregnant? This will vary from woman to woman, depending on her pre-pregnancy fitness level. BUT, even if you weren’t exercising prior to becoming pregnant, you can always start walking, which is usually a safe form of exercise for pregnant women.  I do not have a gym membership, so I either go running or walking outside or do exercises at home.  Below I’m going to share with you some pregnancy core exercises to strengthen those ab muscles.  Just because you are pregnant doesn’t mean you can’t work that core of yours! Of course, as with all physical activity, listen to your body and modify as needed. 
 
Usually during the first trimester, there is no need to alter the type and amount of physical activity you were doing prior to becoming pregnant.  After about 13 weeks, however, there are a few modifications that should be made.  First is to stop doing regular sit-ups and crunches (you don’t need to tell me twice on that one!).  Second, is to not lie flat on your back for an extended amount of time. 
 
Planks 
 
Planks are great at working the core and ab muscles while keeping your baby safe.  Get in plank position: hands on floor, arms extended (square with your shoulders), legs extended with toes on the floor.  Keep your head, neck, spine and rear in line with each other (making sure your butt is not too high or too low).  Hold for 1 minute. 
 
To modify, go down to your elbows and/or lower your knees to the floor, still keeping everything in line. 
 

 
For a challenge, continue in plank position for 1 more minute, this time bringing one arm up and tapping the opposite shoulder.  Switch to the other arm and tapping the opposite shoulder, continuing this for the entire minute. 
 

 
Side Planks 
 
Lie on your side and raise yourself onto your forearm, placing your shoulder directly above your elbow. Keep your shoulders, hips and knees aligned. Rest your other arm along the side of your body. Hold for 30 seconds, then lower yourself to the floor. Repeat on the other side. 
 

 
To modify, lower one leg to the floor. 
 

 
Leg Extensions 
 
Sit down on your bottom and lean back, placing your elbows on the floor behind you. Bring your knees in, tilting them to one side. 
 

 
Extend your legs out as far as you can to the side. Bring your legs back in and switch to the other side. 
 

 
Continue alternating sides for 1 minute. To modify, do not extend your legs all the way out. 
 
Straight Leg Lift Switches 
 
Stay in sitting position with your elbows on the floor behind you.  Bend and bring your knees in front of you. Take one leg and lift it, extending it at the same time. Bring that leg back down and switch to the other leg. Be sure to only lift as far as is comfortable for you (which will probably get harder the further you progress into your pregnancy). 
 

 
Reverse Leg Lifts 
 
Come down to the floor on your hands and knees, making sure your arms are straight, shoulders are square with your hands and your head, neck and spine are in line. 
 

 
Lift one knee, straightening your leg out behind you, making it parallel to the floor.  Bring your knee back down to the floor and repeat with the opposite leg.  Continue alternating sides for 1 minute. 
 

 
Knee to Elbow Lifts 
 
In standing position with your feet shoulder width apart, raise one arm. 
 

 
On the same side, raise your knee while also bringing your arm about half way down, so they almost meet.  If you can touch your knee to your elbow…great! If not, that is okay. Again, only go as far as you feel comfortable. 
 

 
Go back to starting position and repeat the lifts for 30 seconds.  Switch sides and repeat the same exercise on the opposite side for another 30 seconds. 
 
Leaning Boxer 
 
In standing position, lean to one side and raise both arms to the same side. Pretend that you are hitting a small punching bag – do four hits/punches. Lean to the opposite side and do another 4 hits/punches.  Continue alternating sides for 1 minute. 
 

 
Incline Push-ups 
 
Find somewhere in your home that has a safe and sturdy incline, such as your stairs, or you can stack a few big books and place them against a wall. I used my son’s picnic table against the fence for mine. Get in plank position, keeping your head, neck and spine in line.  Do push-ups for 1 minute, if you can. To modify, come down on your knees or do standing wall push-ups. 
 

 
So now you have some great exercises to keep your core and ab muscles strong during pregnancy!  Again…I might sound like a broken record, but listen to your body!  Only go as far or as long as you feel comfortable with any of these exercises and always talk to your doctor before starting any new type of workouts.  Keep up the good work, mama and I hope you have a happy and healthy pregnancy!

While most criticism of American dietary habits focuses on what we eat, a new study suggests that the source of our obesity epidemic might have as much to do with when we eat. 

Or rather, the fact that we never seem to stop eating. 

New research conducted by two professors at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., shows that most Americans eat throughout the day, as opposed to consuming all of their calories from the traditional three square meals. 

The study was a two-part process in which participants were surveyed about their eating habits and then monitored to see how closely their perceptions of their habits reflected reality. 

""Most participants thought they don't eat or drink that regularly outside their breakfast-lunch-dinner routine,"" said study co-author Satchidananda Panda. 

However, the same people who claimed they rarely ate between meals often spread their caloric intake over a 15-hour period. The intensity of the eating is not consistent; less than a quarter of calories were consumed before noon, while more than a third came after 6 p.m. 

The 150 adults who participated in the study were considered healthy and were not asked to alter their diets in any way during the three-week observation period. 

They were asked to take pictures of their food, while an app they were equipped with recorded the total calories, time, and place of the food intake. 

The potential for the findings to effect positive change were tested on a follow-up group of eight obese adults. During a 16-week period, they were asked to restrict their eating to a ten-hour period during the day, but were not asked to abide by any other dietary restrictions. 

The results were encouraging: The participants lost an average of seven pounds over 16 weeks. 

Why? Probably because the time restrictions led them to cut back their daily caloric intake by 20 percent. 

""Basically this new study helps confirm what we already suspect,"" Lora Sandon, a professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, told HealthNews Daily. ""Eating sporadically and at all hours is just not good for our health.

              FILE - In this April 14, 2014 file photo, Vancouver Canucks' head coach John Tortorella laughs after a reporter mistakenly called him Mike during an end of season news conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.   A person familiar with the decision has confirmed to The Associated Press that  Tortorella has been selected to head the United States national team competing in the World Cup of Hockey tournament next year. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because USA Hockey is scheduled to make a formal announcement late Monday, Sept. 21, 2015.  Canada's TSN sports network first reported the news earlier in the day.  (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Darryl Dyck) 
  
John Tortorella is prepared to make a comeback at coaching hockey — on a temporary basis, at least. 
 
Tortorella has been selected to coach the United States national team competing in the World Cup of Hockey tournament next year in Toronto. USA Hockey announced Tortorella's appointment following ESPN's Monday Night Football broadcast. 
 
""There's no greater honor than to represent your country, and I'm humbled to have this experience,"" Tortorella said. ""We'll have one objective, and that will be to bring the World Cup championship back to the United States."" 
 
The Boston-born Tortorella — renowned for his combative personality — has a Stanley Cup championship pedigree, along with more NHL victories than any American-born coach. He won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's coach of the year in 2004, when he also won the Stanley Cup title with the Tampa Bay Lightning. 
 
The 57-year-old Tortorella is 446-375-115 over parts of 14 seasons in his NHL coaching career, which included five high-profile seasons with the New York Rangers. He has been out of the NHL since May 2014, when he was fired after one season in charge of the Vancouver Canucks. 
 
Tortorella was chosen by Team USA general manager Dean Lombardi, who is also the Los Angeles Kings' general manager. 
 
""He knows what it takes to win at the highest level, and I know that our entire management group looks forward to working with him and his staff,"" Lombardi said. 
 
He has ties to USA Hockey, most notably coaching the U.S. team to a sixth-place finish at the 2008 World Championships. He was also a two-time national team assistant, most recently serving under Ron Wilson on the U.S. team that won a silver medal at the 2010 Vancouver Games. 
 
The NHL and NHL Players' Association are jointly organizing the World Cup, which will be played at Toronto before the start of the 2016-17 season. The tournament has been held twice previously, with the U.S. team winning the inaugural title in 1996. 
 
The tournament will feature eight teams. The U.S., Canada, Russia, Sweden, Czech Republic and Finland will field national teams, while the two remaining teams will be made of a mix of players. One will consist of North Americans 23 and younger, and the other will be filled with European-born players whose countries aren't represented, including Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Switzerland.

(Photo : TechloMedia) 

Amazon has listed the specs and color options for Google's unannounced Nexus 5X. The smartphone will ship with Android 6.0 Marshmallow and sport a 5.2-inch 1080p display. 
 
LG and Google are planning their answer to Apple's just-released iPhone 6s Plus in the high-end phablets market. LG is expected to announce the LG V10 at a press event scheduled for October 1. The device is rumored to include a secondary ""ticker"" display that will be used for shortcuts and notifications, separate from the main display. 
 
A few days before LG's event, Google is set to launch its latest Nexus smartphone and phablet, alongside the official release of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Google is believed to have partnered with Huawei – replacing Motorola – in building the Nexus 6P. Leaked images of the device have shown that it will be made of aluminum and have a slightly protruding rear camera, in addition to a 2560 x 1440 Quad HD display. 
 
While the Nexus 6P will battle it out with the iPhone 6s Plus, Google isn't forgetting about the segment of smartphone owners who prefer a more pocketable device. The Nexus 5X has already leaked several times and images have confirmed that LG has been chosen once again to build a Nexus smartphone for Google. 
 
Amazon has joined in on the leaks, listing the LG Nexus 5X on its site in India before quickly removing the page. 
 
The listing matches previous reports that claim the Nexus 5X will feature a 5.2-inch 1920 x 1080 Full HD display with a pixel density of 423 pixels per inch (ppi). The device will run Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box and will be powered by a 1.8GHz Qualcomm hexa core processor, 2 GB of RAM, and include 16 GB of internal storage (model listed). 
 
The handset will pack in a 12.3-megapixel rear camera and 5-megapixel front-facing shooter for selfies and video chat. The smartphone will reportedly be offered in Ice Blue, Charcoal Black and Quartz White. 
 
We'll know the full details of both the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P on September 29 — until then, we'll be sure to keep you posted on any new Nexus news.

The result, in addition to the trending #AskTrump -- on a day that Threshold Editions announced a forthcoming Trump book would be released Oct. 27 -- was a slew of negative questions. 
 
He began answer the questions around 1 p.m. EST with a series of short videos. He did not respond to the (many) derisive questions, though he did tackle a couple on the sillier side. 
 
For instance, to @MarketMavensInc's NFL query,  ""If Tony Romo is out for the season, what chance to the Cowboys have of a playoff,"" Trump said that the quarterback's injury was a terrible thing for the Dallas Coyboys,"" though he finds their defense to be ""excellent."" 
 
And for those unsure of Trump's connected circle, he included that Romo is ""a great guy. I know him."" 
 
Answering ""how would you fix the student debt crisis?"" (from @EliseChristine), Trump spoke in generalities,  saying, ""we are going to restructure it ... so it's very affordable,"" but not giving any specifics. 
 
He also approached a question about homlessness in the U.S. (from @mdmrestoration) vaguely, acknowleding it is a ""big problem"" that largely comes down to a loss of jobs to other countries. ""We're taking our jobs back,"" he said, without elaborating. 
 
He tackled a couple of more polarizing issues, including gun control and Israel. 
 
For the former, he stated, ""I am very pro second amendment,"" referring to ""just released papers"" on the subject at donaldjtrump.com . He then repeated that he's ""very. pro. second. amendment.""

""It depends whether and how rapidly we see some calming. Secondly, to detect an effect on the real side obviously depends on a data flow and 37 days could be a tight period in which to have enough evidence accumulate,"" said Lockhart, possibly pointing toward a December liftoff.

05ec5dc8-1a55-48c5-b9f2-7b7b958a5165,"Scores on the SAT have sunk to the lowest level since the college admission test was overhauled in 2005, adding to worries about student performance in the nation's high schools. 
  
The average score for the Class of 2015 was 1490 out of a maximum 2400, the College Board reported Thursday. That was down 7 points from the previous class's mark and was the lowest composite score of the past decade. There were declines of at least 2 points on all three sections of the test — critical reading, math and writing. 
 
The steady decline in SAT scores and generally stagnant results from high schools on federal tests and other measures reflect a troubling shortcoming of education-reform efforts. The test results show that gains in reading and math in elementary grades haven't led to broad improvement in high schools, experts say. That means several hundred thousand teenagers, especially those who grew up poor, are leaving school every year unready for college. 
 
""Why is education reform hitting a wall in high school?"" asked Michael J. Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a think tank. ""You see this in all kinds of evidence. Kids don't make a whole lot of gains once they're in high school. It certainly should raise an alarm."" 
 
It is difficult to pinpoint a reason for the decline in SAT scores, but educators cite a host of enduring challenges in the quest to lift high school achievement. Among them are poverty, language barriers, low levels of parental education and social ills that plague many urban neighborhoods. 
 
Cyndie Schmeiser — chief of assessment for the College Board, which owns the SAT — said she is concerned because the share of students prepared for college has stagnated for five years. Close to 42 percent of students who took the SAT reached a score of at least 1550, a benchmark for college and career readiness. The share was far lower for Hispanic students (23 percent) and African Americans (16 percent). 
 
""Simply doing the same things we have been doing is not going to improve these numbers,"" Schmeiser said in a statement. ""This is a call to action to do something different to propel more students to readiness."" 
 
Schmeiser cautioned against ""overinterpreting small fluctuations"" in average scores from year to year. 
 
Caveats abound when SAT scores are released. The students who take it are in most cases a self-selected sample, motivated to endure a grueling exercise of 3 hours and 45 minutes on a Saturday. (The test is offered during school days in all public high schools in the District of Columbia and a handful of states.) 
 
Some students take the SAT two or three times. Scores also track closely with family income, rising with affluence, so annual variations in who takes it can swing the results. That makes comparisons of scores among schools, school districts or states problematic. The lower the participation, generally, the higher the scores. 
 
North Dakota, for example, has a seemingly stellar score: 1791, about 300 points above the overall average. But just 134 North Dakotans in the Class of 2015 took the SAT; nearly all students in that state take the rival ACT exam. By contrast, the SAT average in Idaho is 1372. But nearly every graduate in Idaho this year — 17,695 in all — took the SAT. 
 
Since 2005, the SAT has included a writing section worth up to 800 points. That will change in March, when the College Board rolls out a new version that makes the essay optional, does not penalize guessing and contains fewer obscure vocabulary words. The perfect score will snap back to what many parents and teachers remember — 1600. 
 
Through the redesign, Schmeiser said, the College Board aims to ""deliver opportunities for students to succeed in college and careers. It will take time to improve these numbers, but we're deeply committed to making progress."" She cited a partnership with the nonprofit Khan Academy to offer free online tutorials for students preparing for the new SAT. College Board officials are hoping to level the playing field for students who can't afford expensive test-prep classes. 
 
About 1.7 million students in the Class of 2015 took the SAT, up 1.6 percent from the previous class. That total includes people taking the test overseas. The number tested in the 50 states and the District was roughly 1.5 million. The total who took the ACT in the United States was about 1.9 million. 
 
Many students take both tests and submit the one that gives them the best shot at college admission.",Falling SAT scores prompt an alarm over high schools,News,McLeansboro Times Leader,2015-09-04T21:00:00Z

Scott's Marketplace, an e-commerce marketplace for local business owners across the United States who want to affordably sell their products online, is now carrying KYVAN Foods , NFL pro Reggie Kelly's line of salsas, sauces, and seasonings. 

After a long career in the NFL that spanned 13 years with the Atlanta Falcons and Cincinnati Bengals, Reggie Kelly took on entrepreneurship . For years, Kelly and his wife Sheila put on free football camps in their hometown for kids who showed academic excellence. At these camps, Kelly cooked soul-food inspired dishes from family recipes. They were so well-received that Kelly decided to take these products to market, and his company, KYVAN, was formed. Named after his two children, Kylan and Kavan, KYVAN consists of everything from honey apple butter and jambalaya sauce to wing sauce and savory seasonings. 
   
In summer of 2015, KYVAN Foods was named as a finalist in the Martha Stewart American Made Awards contest. The contest highlights the best American-made products, and local business owners, of the year. In addition, KYVAN has received accolades from past teammates, current NFL players, hosts of Thursday Night Tailgate, Sports Talk Radio Network executives, and fans across the United States. 

By selling his products on Scott's Marketplace, Kelly is able to reach a mass amount of shoppers who actively choose to shop local stores over chains. Since Scott's Marketplace is the only e-commerce marketplace to disallow chains and big-box stores, shoppers are drawn to the distinct products and gifts available on the site. 

To open a store on Scott's Marketplace, sellers must be local business owners within the United States, and categories include clothes , beauty, accessories, home décor, jewelry, pets, specialty foods, and more. 

With no membership or per-item listing fees, there is no risk for sellers who open an online store on Scott's Marketplace. When an item sells, there is a 4.99% transaction fee. For consumers who want to shop local stores online, Scott's Marketplace has given them a more convenient way to support these independent business owners. 

Ashleigh Barlow, Scott's Marketplace's Vice President of Marketing says, ""Supporting local businesses like KYVAN is what makes Scott's Marketplace so unique. We are proud to have KYVAN join our rapidly growing list of local stores and look forward to a successful relationship.""

1959ee39-8e65-451a-8537-4d6a920f0e00,"High housing costs are pricing young graduates out of London, according to research. 
 
Those from poor backgrounds are most likely to miss out, potentially losing out on top jobs in areas such as law, the media and finances, it suggests. 
 
The study, published by the Sutton Trust, argues that there is a growing divide between those who can turn to their families for financial help to live in the capital and those that cannot. 
 
It suggests that new housing schemes should be considered, such as student-style housing to enable young people to get a foothold in the capital in the short-term and privately-rented developments targeted at young professionals. 
 
The research, by academics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, looked at the affordability and availability of housing for young people in the capital. 
 
It concluded that since 2001, London's population has risen by 12%, but during the same period housing stock has only risen by 9%. 
 
At the same time, the number of 25 to 34-year-olds living in shared accommodation in the city has increased by 28% over the last decade and last year, there were only two boroughs - Bexley and Barking and Dagenham - where the average house price was less than than eight times that of the average person's income. 
 
The study argues that the cost of living in London is also resulting in a gap between those who can ask their mums and dads for help and those that are unable to turn to their parents. 
 
""The extent to which parents are able to help young professionals - by paying (part of) a deposit, guaranteeing a loan or indeed living in London themselves - is clearly an important factor affecting social mobility,"" it says. 
 
""Those whose parents and grandparents do not own their own home cannot count on this kind of help. 
   Promoted stories   
""If in addition the young professional must pay rent in the private rented sector, their chances of saving for a deposit are further restricted. 
 
""Younger households with parents and grandparents in the rental sector have far less chance of being able to sustain employment in London and are thus excluded from many opportunities for social mobility for themselves and indeed their children."" 
 
Young professionals who are priced out of London may be missing out on jobs in industries that tend to be heavily based in the capital, such as law and the media, and this may be more likely to affect those from poor backgrounds. 
 
The report also says that just 6% of new graduates who move to London are from the most disadvantaged UK neighbourhoods, while 42% come from the most advantaged. 
 
Those from the South East find it easier to live in the capital, it adds, with fewer than 20% of university leavers moving to the city coming from outside this region. 
 
The authors urge candidates in the 2016 London mayoral election to consider new types of housing solutions to deal with the issue and recommends a series of options, including age-targeted housing developments, student-style housing and factory built pre-fabricated housing.

Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said: ""So many of our leading jobs are based in London yet the current housing situation is making it increasingly difficult for graduates from less advantaged homes to move here.

cbd338bc-272f-4aab-9554-b9c00aa7b76b,"It’s hard to believe that only a week ago, we were drinking beer on beaches, in deep denial that summer was about to end. Back then, before Givenchy’s favela , before Alexander Wang’s pole dancers , all we knew about what designers had in store for spring 2016 was a series of vague inspirational images and a few words. We were as innocent and wholesome as Lucky Blue , the Mormon wonder boy who is so perfect that rain cannot frizz his platinum locks. 
 
And just look at us now, living in a brave new world in which everybody seems to have the latest Apple Watches , fashion vapes, and dresses that react to your mood . Our panel of experts are busy weighing in on their favorite things each day . There are hot guys at runway shows and hot dogs at parties. There’s even a new “It” brand to pair with your Mansur Gavriel bags (trust us, we’re good at calling these things ). 
 
Read on for everything of note that’s happened since Fashion Week began.

Kanye, fashion’s most ubiquitous celebrity,  made the rounds this week. ( Overheard at Brother Vellies upon his entrance: “Oh my God, President West is here!”) After a glamorous entrance with Kim at Givenchy, he skulked into Alexander Wang’s Saturday night show alone, wearing a hoodie he refused to remove. Givenchy may have been the most star-studded show so far (actually, Givenchy may have been the most everything show so far), but the Wang front row also included Gaga, Kylie Jenner, Tyga, Miguel, and Nicki Minaj . 
 
On the less predictable end of the celebrity spectrum, we spotted Alicia Silverstone at Christian Siriano and Alyssa Milano’s baby at Marissa Webb. One of them gave us a gracious interview ; the other one refused to talk about Clueless . You’ll have to guess which was which.

Speaking of parties, there have already been at least a dozen and it’s only Monday.  Rihanna’s party had rain and Lindsay Wixson smoking pot with the Brothers Brant. Marc Jacobs’s party for the coffee-table book, Gloss , had a wildly demanding dress code and most people stuck to the mandate against matte surfaces . Notably, Alexander Wang’s tenth anniversary was sponsored by Hooters, whose brand placement included cocktail napkins under mini-burgers, and yes, pole dancers. 
 
Givenchy’s party might have had many VIP levels, but they opened their show to the public . Chanel also invited civilians to their Boyfriend Watch pop-up in the Meatpacking district, an interactive experience telling the story of a love affair between a woman and her watch. Like many a torrid N.Y. romance, the pop-up only lasted through Sunday night. 
       Photo: Billy Farrell/BFA.com  
Cathy Horyn has noticed the lace everywhere,  especially at Givenchy , where Ricardo Tisci’s stunning couture collection raised the bar for all the shows to come. She was less impressed by some of the younger American designers to show this week, though she liked the debut of Monse, designed by a pair of Oscar de la Renta veterans.

Many shows included elements of performance.  Opening Ceremony featured members of the New York City Ballet, who shocked the audience by falling (on purpose) only to get up and break into ecstatic moves. Rachel Comey’s models were modern dancers who wove through the tables at her dinner in powerful, confrontational patterns. Prabal began his show with a cadre of monks chanting against an arresting, marigold-orange wall of light. And Givenchy once again dominated by recruiting the dark princess of performance art, Marina Abramović, to direct several performers, including a live rendition of Ave Maria and a woman standing under an enormous faucet. 

       Photo: Imaxtree, Courtesy of Rachel Comey  
Designers also got creative with their sets, presumably for Instagrammability.  Tanya Taylor collaborated with yarn bomber Hot Tea on a rainbow ceiling installation at her presentation — bright, cheerful, and perfect for the 'gram. Jennifer Fisher’s first NYFW presentation involved a high-concept mechanical installation, with pieces moving up and down on minimalist platforms. And Rosie Assoulin presented her collection in an empty public pool  decorated with Keith Haring paintings, where the movie Kids was filmed 20 years ago. It was also the pool one member of our staff once saw two teenagers having sex in, FWIW. 

       Photo: Andrew Toth/  
And at least one designer decided to go full Instagram,  foregoing a show altogether.   
       Photo: Misha Nonoo/Instagram  
The beauty has been all over the map,  from eyebrows in peril at Wang to bold red lips at Jason Wu t o a graduate-level thesis on youth and artificiality at Hood By Air. HBA designer Shayne Oliver asked his makeup artists to give all the models nonblended contouring, so if you’ve been watching a lot of YouTube beauty videos, but giving up halfway through, you’ll be right on trend. 
       Photo: , Imaxtree  
The models have also been slightly more diverse. Though some shows could have done a better  job  on casting , others made a real effort . Chromat had many different body types , and at Hood By Air, the models refused to conform to anything even resembling a gender binary.

And, of course, the street-style arms race  grows ever more heated , and in addition to clicking through all the best looks , now you can even vote for your favorite in our Golden Peacock poll (here’s where to vote for day one , two , and three .) Whoever has the most votes at the end of the week gets crowned New York's style champion. Rachael Wang seems to be recruiting followers the old-fashioned way, and by old-fashioned we mean biblical — she keeps showing up in fabulous flowing robes in a style we've dubbed #cultcore.

1cc9b183-b07a-4721-825a-27753e58a2f8,"ACCORDING to a report published in the Journal of Medical Screening, more than half of people invited to take a new bowel cancer screening test didn’t take up the opportunity. 
 
The report from Cancer Research UK shows that those from poorer neighbourhoods were less likely to take up the bowel scope screening test, with only one third in the most deprived neighbourhoods going for their appointment compared to over half in the most affluent. 
 
In the most ethnically diverse area, 39 per cent decided to have the test compared to 45 per cent of people in the least ethnically diverse area. And more men (45 per cent) took the potentially life-saving test than women (42 per cent). 
 
Chief Executive of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, Mark Flannagan, said: “Bowel cancer is one of the most preventable cancers, especially when it’s caught early, and screening helps us to do exactly that. So such low initial take up rates for the new bowel scope screening are very worrying, as these show that people are even less willing to participate than with the current faecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) screening test. 
 
“ Screening is vital.  It saves lives as it can pick up cancer even before you have symptoms. The earlier cancer is detected the easier it is to treat and the higher the chance of survival. 
 
“ More needs to be done to promote the benefits of the test if we are to see far greater numbers across the whole country taking up their invitation by the time the programme is fully rolled out by the end of 2018.” 
 
The NHS Bowel Scope Screening Programme offers a one-off test to 55-year-olds that involves a specially trained nurse or doctor using a flexible tube, with a tiny camera on the end, to look inside the large bowel. The test helps prevent bowel cancer by finding and removing pre-cancerous polyps. It can also detect cancer that has already started to develop, before symptoms are noticed and when it’s easier to treat. 
 
The screening programme is being phased in across England and is due to be fully rolled out by 2018. It will run alongside and enhance the current bowel cancer screening programme which sends a DIY faecal occult blood testing kit (FOBt) every two years to people aged 60 to 74 in England. This test looks for hidden blood in stool samples, a possible sign of cancer. 
 
For the report, researchers looked at how many of the 21,000 people in six pilot areas of England, who were sent an appointment, didn’t go ahead with the new test. 
 
It is early days for the new bowel scope programme and there hasn’t been a publicity campaign about it yet so it is not as familiar to people as breast-screening mammograms or cervical-screening smear tests. 
 
Studies have indicated that bowel scope screening could reduce bowel cancer cases by up to 33 per cent and deaths by up to 43 per cent among those who took the test.

049ba090-5f8c-47f3-8031-106f309f00b8,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Talks over the minimum wage began this week here, with unions struggling to put forth a unified position while manufacturers said that the garment sector is unable to stomach a wage hike similar to the one enacted last year.
As the industry has expanded over the years, workers have begun demanding a higher minimum wage. In light of industrial action flaring up due to these negotiations — and even resulting in violence in previous years — brands sourcing from Cambodia have urged the government to institute a wage-setting mechanism.
Currently, the monthly wage, applied solely to the 700,000 garment and footwear workers in the $5.7 billion industry, is $128 — a 28 percent increase from $100 the year before.
This week, representatives from different unions met multiple times to try and obtain a consensus over the amount they will present to the Labor Advisory Committee (LAC), a governmental body composed of union members, employers and officials tasked with deciding on the wage. But there is still disagreement, said Kong Athit, secretary general of the Cambodian Labor Confederation.

59edd45a-ff28-4db1-96d5-123b7d5988f9,"Project Description Two new compact houses have introduced a modern, sustainable, infill-housing model to an old, urban neighborhood while providing two young families with open, efficient homes perfectly suited to their individual lifestyles. 
The Raleigh Architecture Company (RACo), a design-build firm in Raleigh, NC, acted as developer, architect, contractor, and, for one house, owner. 

The process started with land acquisition, followed by locating financing options, then working through variances in the subdivision before RACo could begin design work. For the construction loan, it was also vital to prepare a carefully balanced pro forma considering size and comps (minimum square footage plus three bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths) in this evolving neighborhood. 

Form and materials intentionally recall elements of the context. Front porches, for example: Cantilevered second floors cover front porches that are typical of every home in the old neighborhood. And by designing the houses in tandem, the homeowners can share limited outdoor space between the two slim lots as well as a parti/diagram for the interior floor plans. Yet each house is tailored to its owners’ specific spatial requirements. 

Locally available exterior materials are both sustainable (recycled) and familiar. For 554 Edenton Street, slate shingles from an old house in a historic district nearby provides a unique textural siding. At 556 Edenton Street, the exterior is clad in Corten® steel, which weathers to a warm, rusty patina that will never need painting. Both houses also feature reclaimed North Carolina cypress to add warmth to the decidedly modern forms. Similarly, white oak floors warm the all-white minimalist interiors. 

On these previously empty, narrow, downtown lots along a busy corridor and close to the city sidewalk, both houses’ “public” spaces – living, dining, kitchen – occupy the lower level, where abundant glazing opens the house to the neighborhood. Bedrooms are located on the upper levels where clerestory windows bring natural light into every space without compromising privacy. 

At 554 Edenton: In the house RACo partner Robby Johnston shares with his family, the two-story-clear kitchen is the literal and figurative heart of the house. Large skylights above it bring an abundance of natural light into the center of the house, where the family enjoys preparing meals together. A 10-foot by nine-foot custom fabricated steel-frame glass door at the rear of house opens the entire kitchen/dining area to the back porch, creating continuous public space for entertaining and physically extending the interior into the exterior. The roof’s extra-deep overhang shades the back porch. 

A 13-foot-tall, cast-in-place concrete wall anchors the rear elevation and serves as a guardrail for the second story porch. The concrete form’s ties were left in place to allow vines to grow on the wall, further connecting the house to the urban landscape. 

As the homeowners’ requested, every interior space in 554 Edenton is connected to the outside in some way: Both showers have skylights; the guest room has a view of the Raleigh skyline; the kitchen overlooks the shared green space; and three porches encourage the family to spend plenty of time outdoors. Very intentional window placement also allows Johnston’s children to play outside with the neighbor’s children while he and his wife supervise without intruding. 

556 Edenton: Though slightly larger to accommodate a home office, this house shared its neighbor’s challenge of fitting all the spatial needs onto such a tight urban lot. As a result, the home office became a partial third story. A deep roof overhang shades a porch off the office that affords a panoramic view of the Raleigh skyline since it rises above the roofline of the adjacent house. 

“Public” spaces – living/dining/kitchen, which flow into each other – are located on the first floor, along with both a screened-in and an open back porch. 

Like its neighbor, the kitchen is the literal and figurative heart of this house, too. A huge skylight above this central, two-story-clear space floods the core of the house with natural light. A dramatic, custom-fabricated steel staircase rises from the central space to provide vertical circulation. It is the single ordering element that connects all spaces and all levels. Painted black, it is also a sculptural element within the house’s white interior. The kitchen also features a custom-fabricated light fixture in North Carolina walnut above the central island. A similar fixture hangs in the master bedroom. 

The neighbors have warmly welcomed the new houses, and their occupants, and expressed their pleasure over hearing the sound of children’s laughter again.",Edenton Street Duo,News,Architect Magazine,2015-09-05T01:40:07Z

LAKEHURST  — If the New Jersey State Police know what was in the sky over this borough on Jan. 11, no one from the agency is offering an explanation. 

After a five month internal affairs investigation, its Office of Professional Standards ""failed to develop sufficient evidence to substantiate the allegation"" that one of its State Police helicopter pilots was intentionally buzzing the rooftops of houses in town. The State Police took the unusual step of announcing the end of its internal probe in a letter sent last month to a reporter at the Asbury Park Press. The letter was sent from Capt. Scott M. Ebner, chief of the Intake and Adjudication Bureau in the Office of Professional Standards. 

Last January, municipal officials and ordinary residents began to report unusual encounters with a State Police helicopter operating at low altitudes over the borough. Those in municipal government noticed a pattern — the homes of specific Lakehurst officials seemed to be targeted and the common thread between them was that they all had a role in disciplinary action against a local police officer who has a family member in the State Police Aviation Bureau. 

On Jan. 16, at the request of Mayor Harry Robbins, borough attorney Sean D. Gertner fired off a letter to the State Police superintendent in pursuit of an explanation. 

""I write this correspondence as several residents have reported uneasiness to the mayor regarding recent activities of a State Police helicopter within the borough,"" Gertner wrote to Col. Rick Fuentes. 

Gertner continued: ""Several residents have noticed a significant increase in activity. The mayor's concern is that this activity has not been reported to local law enforcement to our knowledge, and the mayor asked if I could ascertain if the increase in activity was related to any particular information. ... Thank you for your usual and expected courtesies."" 

After the Asbury Park Press first reported on the borough attorney's letter to Fuentes, an internal affairs investigation was initiated on Feb. 2 and completed on July 21. Ultimately, the investigation found no evidence of official misconduct. 

On Friday, Gertner expressed surprise that the State Police had taken the extraordinary step of sending a letter to the Press to announce that their internal affairs investigation had found nothing improper. He said no one in Lakehurst had received a similar letter, even though the request for an investigation originated with the municipal government. 

""No one at the borough has been informed of the status of the investigation,” Gertner said.

The American goes into the bout a perfect 48-0 and will equal the record of legendary heavyweight Rocky Marciano if — as expected — he sends Berto, who has lost three of his last six fights, packing. 

Mayweather, 38, insists this is the last fight of his career — few believe him — and he has faced criticism from fight fans who say he ducked the best in weight division in cherry-picking Berto. 

Britain's Amir Khan was among a host of fighters who wanted a go at pound-for-pound king Mayweather and the bout has failed to grab the interest of the public — tickets were still widely available at the MGM Grand three days before the showdown. 

""Berto is not a pushover. No matter who I choose, the media will have something to say,"" Mayweather said. ""Khan has three losses, Berto has three. No matter what the media say, when it comes down to it, it is two competitors and I know what I can do. 

""I can fight. When you talk about highest gates, I am that guy. Highest (television) pay-per-view, I am that guy."" 

He rejected talk from Virgil Hunter, Berto's respected trainer, that there was a personal beef between the two fighters, who engaged in a seemingly intense faceoff after the press conference.

By Nate Raymond 
 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A billionaire Macau developer arrested for lying to U.S. customs officials about why he brought $4.5 million in cash into the United States was subpoenaed in 2014 as part of a separate foreign bribery investigation, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
 
Ng Lap Seng, who was previously tied to a Clinton-era campaign finance probe, is being held without bail on charges filed in Manhattan federal court that he lied to U.S. customs officials about the purpose of the cash he brought into the country over a two-year period. 
 
In a criminal complaint made public on Monday, an FBI agent recounted serving a subpoena on Ng in July 2014 in connection with an ""unrelated investigation,"" which a prosecutor in court later said involved a probe based outside of Manhattan. 
 
That subpoena, which the complaint said Ng did not respond to, stemmed from a probe in Nevada involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits bribing foreign officials, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the case. 
 
The target of that investigation was unclear. But Ng's name has repeatedly surfaced in a private lawsuit against billionaire Sheldon Adelson's Las Vegas Sands Corp that the casino operator has said it believed prompted an FCPA investigation. 
 
Kevin Tung, Ng's lawyer, said on Thursday he did not know what the subpoena said and was still gathering information. The U.S. Justice Department declined comment. Las Vegas Sands in a statement said it is cooperating with the investigation. 
 
Ng, 68, heads Macau-based Sun Kian Yip Group, and has made much of what U.S. prosecutors called his $1.8 billion fortune on lavish developments in the former Portuguese colony. 
 
His properties include the Fortuna casino and residential complex Windsor Arch, which overlooks Macau's race course and the Cotai Strip. 
 
Ng also sits on the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an adviser to the government. 
 
He and his assistant Jeff Yin were arrested on Saturday for allegedly falsely claiming $4.5 million in cash they brought into the United States from China between 2013 to 2015 was meant to buy art, antiques or real estate, or be used for gambling. 
 
At a hearing on Saturday, U.S. prosecutor Daniel Richenthal said Yin told authorities after his arrest that the money was used to pay people ""to engage in unlawful activities,"" according to a transcript. 
 
Yin's lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, disputed that account, and Tung in an interview said the case was a ""misunderstanding."" 
 
Ng's name previously surfaced in U.S. investigations into how foreign money might have been funneled into the Democratic National Committee prior to the 1996 elections, when it was working to re-elect President Bill Clinton. 
 
A 1998 U.S. Senate report said that Ng collaborated with Little Rock, Arkansas restaurateur Charlie Tries to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign funds to the DNA. 
 
Tries later pleaded guilty. Nag, who prosecutors say stopped coming to the United States for five years amid that probe, was never charged. 
 
The 2014 subpoena cited in the complaint came after Nag's name first surfaced in a lawsuit filed in 2010 against Las Vegas Sands by the former CEO of Adel son's Macau casinos, Steven Jacobs. 
 
Macau is the only legal casino hub in China, and Sands China Ltd, a publicly traded unit of Las Vegas Sands, is one of six licensed casino operators in the southern Chinese territory. 
 
Las Vegas Sands has said it believes that FCPA investigations by the Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission were prompted by Jacobs' lawsuit. 
 
Jacobs contended he was fired after resisting Adel son's demands that Las Vegas Sands rehire a lawyer, Leone Elves, who was also a Macau legislator and who allegedly told the company Chinese officials had offered to resolve some issues facing it for a $300 million payment. 
 
Nag allegedly was Elves' contact with the officials, acting as what a lawyer for Jacobs described in a court hearing in May as a ""courier or messenger."" 
 
No evidence exists the payment was ever made, and the company denies wrongdoing. Testifying in May, Adel son said he did not know Nag and had never sent any messages to him or heard of his name until Jacobs' lawsuit. 
 
Lawyers for Jacobs did not respond to requests for comment. 
 
The case is U.S. v. Sen, U.S. District Court, District of New York, No. 15-mj-03369.

""Gold and oil are down, and when commodity prices are lower, the kiwi and Aussie suffer.""HiFX's Bodle said commodity prices have been ""whippy"" in recent weeks, and today's decline will probably be short-lived. The kiwi dollar has traded between 62 US cents and 64 cents since mid-August in a consistent downtrend, and Bodle said it's probably ready for a brief correction above 64 cents. 

The Reserve Bank continued to be a net buyer of New Zealand dollars in August, purchasing a net $81 million in the month, according to data released today. 

The bank bought a net $191 million in July. The central bank yesterday announced it would pay the government a $530 million dividend after a weaker kiwi dollar generated gains from its holdings of foreign currencies.New Zealand's two-year swap rate fell three basis points to 2.69 percent at 5pm in Wellington, and the 10-year swap dropped eight basis points to 3.48 percent. 

The local currency declined to 90.64 Australian cents from 91 cents yesterday, and fell to 4.0129 Chinese yuan from 4.0769 yuan. It dropped to 75.43 yen from 77.02 yen yesterday, and fell to 56.01 euro cents from 57.18 cents. 

The kiwi decreased to 41.58 British pence from 42.09 pence yesterday.

af443f9f-3424-4415-ae5f-0f05e01ee6ad,"Manchester United made Anthony Martial the biggest signing of transfer deadline day as two of the biggest moves failed to materialise. 
 
The striker  joined United from Monaco for £36million, a world-record fee for a teenager - and he will have a surprise team-mate at Old Trafford after the collapse of David de Gea's move to Real Madrid. 
 
Spain goalkeeper De Gea's planned £29million switch, which would have brought Keylor Navas in the opposite direction, was thwarted when the necessary paperwork was not submitted before Spain's deadline of 11pm on Monday - but the fall-out from that continued to dominate the agenda. 
 
In a strong statement on Tuesday, Real insisted they had done ""everything necessary"" to conclude De Gea's signing, after United said that they had already submitted their paperwork on time and can provide proof. 
 
Real may yet appeal to La Liga or FIFA, world football's governing body, but appear more likely to wait until January, or next summer, to end their long-term attempts to sign the talented goalkeeper. 
 
Berahino's failed transfer had similarly been building throughout the summer months and the 22-year-old striker became vocal in his criticism of West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace, appearing to threaten to never again play for the club after a third Spurs bid was rejected. 
 
""Sad how i cant say exactly how the club has treated me but I can officially say i will never play Jeremy Peace,"" he tweeted. 
 
West Ham failed to net one of Tottenham's existing strikers, with an apparent contract dispute with the White Hart Lane club preventing a move for Emmanuel Adebayor. 
 
The Hammers did, though, complete loans for Chelsea's Victor Moses and Alex Song from Barcelona while Nikica Jelavic and Michail Antonio signed permanently from Hull and Nottingham Forest respectively. 
   Promoted stories   
Aaron Lennon left Spurs for Everton in a move announced after the 6pm deadline. 
 
The 28-year-old former England winger signed a three-year contract to return to the Merseyside club, where he spent the second half of the past season on loan. His arrival followed that of Argentinian defender Ramiro Funes Mori from River Plate for £9.5million. 
 
Winger Matt Jarvis joined Norwich on loan for the season from West Ham but  Bradley Johnson left Carrow Road to join Derby for an undisclosed fee. 
 
Aston Villa loaned left-back Joe Bennett to Bournemouth but recruited fellow defenders Tiago Ilori and  Joleon Lescott. 
 
Bennett was joined at Bournemouth by central defender Tomas Andrade, on loan until the end of the season from River Plate, and striker Glenn Murray on a three-year contract from Crystal Palace.

The identity of captain Alastair Cook's opening partner is sure to have been the principal head-scratcher - in a likely list of 17 names - for national selector James Whitaker, coach Trevor Bayliss and their panel of colleagues. 
 
After an Ashes summer which has often confounded logic, few things can be said with certainty - other than England prevailed 3-2 against the odds, to regain the urn, and they face a greater test of their credentials in both the UAE and then South Africa this winter. 
 
All indications are the desert will be especially hazardous - against 'hosts' who defeated then world-beaters England 3-0 on their only previous visit, and have since gone unbeaten in series on their new patch. 
 
England will travel nonetheless under no illusions they must somehow get runs on the board and also have a spin contingent capable of keeping them in the equation. 
 
Those two objectives could yet centre on the same player. 
 
The elevation of Moeen Ali to open, and bowl plenty of overs of off-spin alongside Adil Rashid turning the ball mostly in the other direction, has been the talking point for much of the second half of England's home summer. 
   Promoted stories   
As Adam Lyth's failure to contribute against Australia extended to 115 runs in nine innings, the leap of faith required to back him at the start of a new assignment took on ever more fanciful proportions. 
 
Alex Hales was a contender, certainly before his equally paltry run in the Royal London Series, to make a Test debut in Lyth's place. 
 
After his 53 runs in five white-ball attempts, though, Moeen and Nick Compton - among the most solid of a statistically unconvincing bunch from the county season - have leapfrogged Hales as the most feasible options. 
 
Compton was the first alternative England turned to after Andrew Strauss' retirement three years ago left them needing someone to keep Cook company against the new ball. 
 
He was discarded after nine Tests in which he hit two hundreds and averaged in the low 30s, harshly some including Compton himself felt. 
 
Whether there is to be a return for him, a promotion for Moeen, a different kind of punt on Lyth or Hales - or a hunch for someone else - Bayliss was giving nothing away as he reflected on the one-day international series defeat against Australia, and what the future may hold. 
 
The suspicion was not of deliberate evasiveness on the coach's part, but more likely he simply he could not project the outcome of the next day's discussions. 
 
Assessing the merits of Hales, or the uncapped James Taylor further down the order after his encouraging ODI series, Bayliss said: ""You'd like to see them in form - whatever style of cricket you're playing. 
 
""Both guys have had reasonably good championship seasons, so I'm sure they'll be spoken about quite highly at the selection meeting. 
 
""If you're good player in one, you should be a good player in the other."" 
 
In a summer which so far has seen only four available Test openers - Compton, another former incumbent Michael Carberry, Hales and Mark Stoneman - pass 1,000 first-class runs, new options are far from obvious. 
 
Bayliss said: ""I think one of the things is there's no one out there who's actually putting their hand up saying 'I'm definitely the player to pick'. 
 
""There are good players who have had okay seasons - but I don't think anyone out there has made five, six, seven hundreds. If someone could do that, you'd be putting them in the team straightaway almost."" 
 
The squad m ay contain a third spin option in the uncapped Zafar Ansari, whose batting proficiency puts him at the head of that queue, but it should not be over-stocked with seamers. 
 
England picked only two frontline pace bowlers in the last two Tests in 2011/12, and this time have all-rounder Ben Stokes able to bowl as quick as anyone. 
 
They will include extra batsmen, with Jonny Bairstow - wicketkeeping understudy too - Taylor and Gary Ballance in the reckoning. 
 
Once all of the above is sorted, the selectors can turn their minds to picking ODI and Twenty20 squads - also set to be named on Tuesday, to take on Pakistan.

Caitlyn Jenner gives moving acceptance speech on July 15 at the Microsoft theater in Los Angeles. CREATIVE COMMONS 

Caitlyn Jenner was given the honor of receiving the Arthur Ashe Award for courage despite the displeasure of the general public. 

Over the summer, Caitlyn Jenner, formally known as Bruce, announced that she is transgender. Jenner later went through a series of gender reassignment surgeries to fully transition from man to woman. 

Other nominees for the Arthur Ashe Award included Lauren Hill and Noah Galloway. Hill is a 19-year-old basketball player from Indiana battling an inoperable brain tumor that claimed her life. Galloway is a double amputee Army veteran from Alabama who went on to compete on “Dancing With The Stars.” 

The legacy of Arthur Ashe lives on through those who choose to embody his way of life. 

Recipients show strength when adversity stares them in the face and the courage to stand up for what they believe. 

Few people saw these qualities in Jenner. 

43 students participated in a survey that asked them for their opinion about Jenner being honored with the award. 

60 percent of those surveyed said Jenner was not a worthy recipient for the award. When asked which of the other two nominees was more deserving of the award 50 percent voted for Hill while 41 percent voted for Galloway. 

“I believe there could be a more deserving candidate than Jenner,” Nick Vivian, sophomore early and special Education major, said. 

The struggles for the transgender community have existed for years, yet Jenner has essentially become the spokesperson for this community. 

However, she became this icon due to her involvement in popular social media. 

She had the access to major financial and moral support from her family to go on with her sex- change operation, which is not always obtained by many of the transgender community. 

“Even though Caitlyn Jenner did show courage through the transitions she made, there are people who struggle with trans-sexuality and are denied and thrown out for who they are,” Paige Wagner, sophomore graphic design major, said.","Jenner receives Arthur Ashe courage award, which causes controversy",News,Loquitur,2015-09-17T02:26:00Z

Field demonstrations continue to be an integral part of Canada’s Outdoor Farm Show (COFS) each year. For 2015, the demo lineup has been announced and planning is already underway. 

This year, field demonstrations will include large balers for corn stalks and planting demos with high speed, twin-row and drill planters. The demos will take place each day of the Show, which runs September 15, 16 and 17, 2015 in Woodstock, Ontario. 

“Planting is the most critical field operation for a good crop and effective seeding equipment is very important,” says Paul Roper, COFS field demonstration manager. “There is impressive technology to help ensure accurate seeding and that’s why we’re featuring the latest planters this September.” 

Gone are the days of throwing small bales by hand. Today’s hay, straw and corn stalks are handled as big bales. “The way these crops are handled has changed and so has the equipment,” adds Roper. “Today’s big balers handle a lot of crop in a shorter time and we’re pleased to feature this technology as part of our field demos this year.” 

The well-attended demos are just one feature that differentiates Canada’s Outdoor Farm Show. Each year, attendees have the chance to witness technology in action, in the field, under real conditions. The field demos, which will take place daily in the Southwest Demonstration Field from 12:30-2:30, typically draw between 1,000 and 1,800 attendees.

Some key players of this market include Bruker Corporation, Danish Micro Engineering (DME), FEI Company, Hitachi High Technologies Corporation, JEOL Ltd., Leica Microsystems, Nanoscience Instruments, Inc., Nikon Corporation, Olympus Corporation, Tescan Orsay Holding and Carl Zeiss. The extensively adopted strategic initiative by key players includes substantial investment in R&D of SEMs. According to the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative, public investment in nanotechnology grew from zero in 2000 to approximately USD 65 billion in 2011. New product launches such as outlens type thermalelectron gun scanning electron microscope by Hitachi High Technologies Corporation is also likely to serve as a viable sustainability strategy.

AKRON, Ohio -- Akron Zips football head coach Terry Bowden played no games this week with his quarterback carousel. He named sophomore Tommy Woodson the starter after Woodson came off the bench to lead the Zips to a resounding 52-9 victory over Savannah State last Saturday. 

Woodson, from Pennsylvania, will take the Zips' (1-2) first snap on the road against Louisiana-Lafayette (1-1), a team that had a bye week to prep for Saturday's 7 p.m. contest. 

""I think Tommy Woodson deserves to start,'' Bowden said. ""I don't know if we're ready to make a decision on Kyle Pohl (head injury) yet. How the rotation plays out, we'll see.'' 

That means sophomore quarterback Tra'Von Chapman, who struggled while starting the first three games, will be the likely backup for the 6-1, 228-pound Woodson, who was 12-for 20 for 207 yards with a touchdown pass and an interception. 

And Chapman (10-for-35, 157 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT for the season) could fall to third in line if senior Pohl is cleared by Wednesday. It would be a quick drop for Chapman, the hyped sophomore product of Kent Roosevelt who has fallen well short of expectations after first signing with Pitt, then transferring to Ashland and now with the Zips. 

""Chapman is a competitor, he doesn't like it,'' Bowden said.

c3e5a41d-5ca7-4f25-9dee-ea6f05050c1b,"Paddy Power and Betfair have agreed on a £5 billion merger to create one of the world's largest online gambling businesses, with more than 7,000 staff and £1.2 billion in sales. 
 
The companies confirmed details of the tie-up after revealing the plans last month, marking the latest in a string of deals in the industry as it faces new taxes on online gambling and the need to invest in marketing and technology. 
 
The combined group - to be called Paddy Power Betfair - will have its headquarters in Dublin and is set to maintain a ""significant presence"" in the UK and Ireland. 
 
They will continue to run separate brands in the UK, Ireland and Italy after the merger, which will see Paddy Power shareholders own 52% of the combined business, with Betfair investors owning the remaining 48%. 
 
But the firms warned of job losses under plans for around £50 million in annual cost savings after the merger. 
 
They said while no decisions have been taken, there was potential for cutbacks in some operational and support functions, which ""may involve some headcount reduction"". 
 
The deal - dubbed ""Betty Power"" in the industry - will bring together Paddy Power's 336 shops in the UK and 252 stores in Ireland with Betfair's online betting exchange. 
 
Around 80% of their combined annual revenues will be from online business, making it a force to be reckoned with in the gambling sector as it increasingly moves online. 
 
Gary McGann, chairman of Paddy Power, said: ""The merger of Paddy Power and Betfair will create a company of world class capability and people who will deliver substantial up-front synergies and a platform for very exciting business expansion."" 
 
Gerald Corbett, chairman of Betfair, added the deal makes ""huge strategic sense by bringing together two industry leading and successful businesses and providing enlarged scale, capability and distinctive, complementary brands"". 
   Promoted stories   
Consolidation in the gambling sector has been heating up over the past few months, with rivals Ladbrokes and Gala Coral agreeing a merger in July to create a £2.3 billion gambling giant, which is expected to overtake the UK's biggest bookmaker William Hill. 
 
The move will bring together 2,100 shops from Ladbrokes and 1,845 from Coral, although the deal is conditional on approval from the Competition and Markets Authority. 
 
And FoxyBingo owner bwin.party last week backed a £1.1 billion cash-and-shares offer from Sportingbet owner GVC after a protracted takeover tussle. 
 
Paddy Power Betfair will be listed in the UK and Ireland and will be headed by Betfair chief executive Breon Corcoran. 
 
He was previously chief operating officer at Paddy Power until he joined Betfair three years ago. 
 
The merged group will have customers from more than 100 countries, with aims for further international expansion across continental Europe, the US and Australia. 
 
The firms confirmed Paddy Power shareholders will receive a special dividend of 80 million euro (£58 million). 
 
Shareholders are expected to vote on the deal in December, with the merger due to complete in the first quarter of 2016. 
 
Paddy Power was founded in 1988 by the merger of three existing Irish bookmakers and it has become well known for its irreverent marketing style. 
 
Its rapid growth in recent years has seen it build more than 300 betting shops in Ireland and the UK, and it now ranks as the third largest online bookmaker and sixth largest online gaming business in Britain and Ireland. 
 
Betfair comes from a newer side of the bookmaking fence. 
 
In 1999, professional gambler Andrew Black and city professional Edward Wray joined forces to form The Sporting Exchange, which went on to launch the Betfair Betting Exchange the following year, offering the market something of a revolution.

The fierce rivalry between Apple and Microsoft has stopped being about ""winning and losing"" because the two technology giants need each other, an industry expert has said. 
 
		 
When Microsoft executive Kirk Koenigsbauer walked on stage at Apple's latest product launch in San Francisco, the relationship between the two firms changed, according to Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight. 
  Apple CEO Tim Cook discusses the new iPad during the Apple event in San Francisco (AP)   
At the event, Apple unveiled a third version of the iPad - the iPad Pro - which looks set to take on Microsoft's Surface Pro 3. 

			 
But despite the competition, Mr Wood said Microsoft needed to work with its rival. 



 
Mr Wood said: ""It is not about winning or losing - the new Microsoft has woken up to the fact it has to embrace all platforms to be successful."" 

He added that  it was ""extraordinary that Apple have got themselves into a position where Microsoft thought a public show of support was important"". 
  The new iPad Pro with a smart keyboard is displayed in San Francisco (AP)   
""A few years ago, hell would have frozen over before Microsoft endorsed Apple so publicly, but their business model is changing."" he said. 

Apple's chief Tim Cook called the iPad Pro the ""biggest news in iPad since the iPad"" as he unveiled the device live on stage. 

			 
The iPad Pro will have a 12.9 inch screen with more than five million pixels, a keyboard and a stylus called the Apple Pencil. 

A UK price is yet to be confirmed but it will go on sale in November. 

Mr Koenigsbauer's job was to show what Microsoft's Office software could do on Apple's new device, a move away from competing directly with Apple on hardware. 

Wired.co.uk editor Michael Rundle said: ""Apple and Microsoft are fierce rivals, but they need each other. 

			 
""Apple makes the most popular mobile hardware in the world, and Microsoft makes Office, the world's most-used enterprise software. 

""The reality in 2015 is that Microsoft's long-term survival as a major player depends on people using its products, on the devices they love."" 

Apple also unveiled the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which both come with a pressure-sensitive screen that uses technology called 3D Touch, where applying more or less pressure to a tap opens new shortcuts. 

The new iPhones will go on sale on September 25, with pre-orders for the devices beginning on September 12, starting at £539 for 6s and £619 for the 6s Plus. 

But some have been critical of this latest offering. 

			 
Mr Wood said: ""Apple is the powerhouse that keeps on rolling. 

""But its fair to say even Apple is struggling to meet people's expectations."" 

Mr Rundle agreed, saying: ""Anyone who watched the original iPhone announcement and thought to themselves, 'this is a moment in history' will be a bit disappointed by this latest launch. 

""But we can't expect massive technological advance every time, increasingly it has become about refinement: devices that are faster, have better cameras, but don't represent a huge change for consumers."" 

Apple may not be revealing advances that warrant front-page news, he said, but they continued to make headlines because people looked to them for leadership - whether willingly or unwillingly. 

""Apple launches have become a huge event culturally, although that might not always be the case,"" Rundle said. 

""But at the moment, Apple launches have a sense of style and panache that others struggle to match."" 

At the event, a much rumoured Apple TV revamp was also confirmed, with Apple's voice assistant technology Siri now integrated to use in searches.

A rare revival of Sharman Macdonald’s quietly haunting play reveals uncomfortable truths about the oppressiveness of family life and sexual attitudes in wartime Scotland Follow-ups are always difficult. Sharman Macdonald scored a big hit with her first play, When I Was a Girl I Used to Scream and Shout, but this piece, originally seen at the National Theatre in 1988, never achieved comparable success. On a rare revival it turns out to be a quietly haunting play that reveals a lot about the oppressiveness of family life and inherited sexual attitudes in wartime Scotland.

Macdonald’s heroine, Isla, is a young, working-class woman who is savvy, strong-minded and, like her dad, a bit of a drinker. Her misfortune is to run into Mackenzie, a naval petty officer and duplicitous romantic who instantly proposes to her. With some skill, Macdonald shows how Isla becomes a victim of traditional, patriarchal views: her father tells her that a woman gains position and social standing through marriage, while her mother argues that, even in times of trouble, “a woman has to cleave to a man”. 

The use of a big second-act revelation to expose the folly of such antediluvian attitudes strikes me as old-fashioned for such a deliberately non-linear play. But Macdonald captures well the cramping respectability of Scottish working-class life, the resort to religion in times of crisis and the love of country that underlies everything.

Eleanor Rhode’s production, jointly presented by Snapdragon and the Orange Tree, is strong on atmosphere. Abigail Lawrie, who made a big impression as Krystal in the BBC adaptation of JK Rowling’s The Casual Vacancy, offers a fascinating blend of defiance and melancholy; Lorraine Pilkington and Steve Nicolson are very good as the deeply protective but morally flawed parents; and Mark Edel-Hunt just about convinces us that the maudlin, self-pitying Mackenzie has enough charm to woo a strong spirit like Isla.

Even when it meanders, the play has a measure of truth.

Designing a website is no easy task to tackle. There are many aspects to consider, ranging from design to content to clarity. While an attractive and appealing website is of the utmost importance, it is crucial that your page is also clever and intuitive. Below are some common website design pitfalls and how to fix or avoid them. 

1.    Unclear purpose. Conveying your company's message is a vital aspect in the success of your website, and should be apparent immediately upon entrance. What makes you different? What does your company strive to do? Avoid making people play a guessing game by making assumptions about your company - clarity is key! 

2.    Not capturing customers. Every business should strive to develop long-term relationships with customers or users, and not limit them to one-time exchanges. Make sure your social media page's links are visible and prominent so that those who want to keep in touch and get updates from you can do so with ease. Also, incorporating multiple email sign-up spaces is a great way to capture customers and cultivate lasting relationships.  

3.    Nonexistent contact information. Customers are often looking for support, and keeping phone numbers and contact emails front and center is your best bet in alleviating customer questions or concerns. Keeping your customers happy and satisfied is the key to maintaining a successful business. 

4.    Frustrating fonts. It has been said that website content should be able to read like a book. Using large fonts is important to eliminate the struggle of making your main message clear and legible. Your text shouldn't be too long, but it shouldn't be too short either - you should be able to convey your message without having to write an entire novel about your company.

d0037a52-d01a-4425-bb47-ede8b5f34b38,"A federal judge ruled in favor of Tom Brady on Thursday, vacating an arbitration decision by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that upheld a four-game suspension for Brady’s role in Deflategate. 

While the decision by Judge Richard M. Berman in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York gives the Patriots quarterback and the Players Association a key win against the league, it certainly doesn’t signal the end of the case. Here’s a look at what’s next: 

What does the win mean? 

The NFL sought affirmation of its arbitration in Brady’s case — one that included a 10-hour hearing on June 23 — while the NFLPA asked Berman to vacate the award. That he did is noteworthy as federal courts overwhelmingly confirm arbitration decisions. 

PDF:  Read Judge Berman's decision 

A review  of arbitration decisions in the Southern District from 2005-11 conducted by three attorneys in a 2013 article in New York Dispute Resolution Lawyer found that in the 68 labor and employment awards they studied, only two were denied confirmation. 

What’s next? 

Given the strained labor relations between the league and the union, the NFL will seek to overturn Berman’s decision and will appeal the decision to the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. 

The league’s arguments centered on Article 46 of the collective bargaining agreement, which NFL attorneys said gives the commissioner wide latitude to rule on matters affecting the integrity of the game. The NFL will not let a decision like Berman’s stand as precedent without challenging it. 

Will Tom Brady play? 

Yes. Berman’s decision sets aside the four-game suspension, so Brady will be eligible to start in New England’s season opener on Sept. 10 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 

Can the NFL do anything to stop it? 

Technically, yes, but it’s not guaranteed the league would and that it would be successful even if the NFL tried. 

The NFL could ask Berman to stay his own decision – basically setting it aside while the case is on appeal. It would have to show a strong likelihood of success, irreparable injury in the absence of a stay, absence of substantial injury to the party opposing the stay and the public interest. 

That’s a tough test to pass for the NFL, as federal courts have held that a pro athlete missing games could constitute substantial injury. The league would also have a tough time arguing it would suffer harm if one of its most popular players on the defending Super Bowl champion team plays. 

If Berman denies a stay motion, the NFL could seek one from the 2nd Circuit but the same criteria would apply. 

From a pure business standpoint, it might be the best decision to not seek a stay. Should the NFL win on appeal, it can suspend Brady later. 

So when will this be over? 

The short answer is not soon. The NFL could seek to have its case expedited, but even if the 2nd Circuit would grant that there’s no guarantee the case would be resolved before the end of the 2015 season. 

It’s impossible to predict the timeline, but the median time from filing the notice of appeal to the final disposition of the case for a 12-month period ending March 31, 2015, was 10 months for the 2nd Circuit. 

Will it end when the 2 nd Circuit decides? 

Yes. The losing party could seek an en banc review by the entire 13-judge panel in the 2nd Circuit or appeal to the Supreme Court. Lawyers interviewed by USA TODAY Sports see no chance of either happening.",Deflategate Q&A: What happens next? 42 minutes ago,News,10connects.com,2015-09-03T15:37:11Z
1dffe23a-0648-441f-9854-27d52cd4a2a7,"WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Police say they arrested Purdue freshmen cornerbacks Evyn Cooper and David Rose for trying to stealing bicycles.

WLFI-TV and the Journal & Courier report Purdue University Police arrested Cooper for theft and Rose for attempted theft about 1 a.m. Wednesday on campus. The two players, both 18, were booked into Tippecanoe County Jail and released on bond.

Police Chief John Cox said Thursday he could not release any more details because it was an ongoing investigation.

It wasn't clear if either player has an attorney who might comment.

Purdue athletics spokesman Matt Rector said coach Darrell Hazell was aware of the arrests.

Rose, who is from Temple Hills, Maryland, has appeared in one of Purdue's two games. Cooper, from Buford, Georgia, hasn't played.

0b545923-f6d5-4a1b-b23f-68618811f3a5,"ST. LOUIS , Sept. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Peabody Energy ( NYSE: BTU ) today announced a 1-for-15 reverse stock split on shares of the company's common stock.  Authorization to implement the reverse stock split was approved by Peabody shareholders at a special meeting held earlier today.  

""We thank our shareholders for their continued support as we work through these challenging times,"" said President and Chief Executive Officer Glenn Kellow .  ""Peabody is advancing further initiatives across our global platform with an intense focus on operational excellence, lean organization, portfolio management and financial strength."" 
   
The reverse stock split is expected to become effective at the close of business on 
Sept. 30, 2015 (the ""effective time""), which would result in Peabody's common stock to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis at market open on Oct. 1 , 2015.  Upon completion of the reverse stock split, every 15 shares of common stock owned by a shareholder will be combined into one share of common stock, and the number of outstanding shares will be reduced from approximately 278 million to approximately 19 million.  

Peabody will not issue fractional shares in connection with the reverse stock split.  Shareholders who would otherwise hold fractional shares following the reverse stock split will receive cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) in lieu of such fractional shares.  The sum will be based on the net proceeds, after customary brokerage commissions and other expenses, resulting from the transfer agent aggregating and selling all fractional share interests into the market.  Such proceeds will be paid on a pro rata basis, depending on the fractional amount of shares owned.  

After the effective time, holders of certificated shares and registered book-entry holders of common stock will be sent a transmittal letter from Peabody's transfer agent, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (AST), regarding their stock ownership.  All questions regarding ownership should be directed to AST at (800) 937-5449.  Beneficial holders of Peabody's common stock are encouraged to contact their bank, broker, custodian or other nominee with questions regarding procedures for processing the reverse stock split.

6fbff256-bc51-49cf-83df-87ba3b81ed2e,"Dark Elegance can go well in the opener at Chelmsford City Racecourse this evening (Thursday), the mile-and-a-quarter handicap for apprentice riders at 5.40. 

The best of his four races to date was at Wolverhampton over a mile and half a furlong last Saturday night, when he not only blew the start but turned for home widest of all. Despite this, none of his rivals were finishing faster in the last 100 yards as he went fourth late on. 

Ancient Trade looks the one in the six-furlong maiden event for two-year-olds at 6.10. 

He ran encouragingly when fourth at Newmarket on August 29, challenging two furlongs out but unable to match the first three in the last hundred yards. 
 
Little Prairie didn't quite last home in her most recent race and the drop in trip will suit her in the Class 4 fillies' handicap over a mile at 6.40. 

Over a mile and a quarter at Lingfield on September 2, she held every chance on the bend but faded in the last furlong. She's preferred to the front-running Ajaadat, who might struggle to last home from the widest stall (seven of seven). 

The penny may well finally drop with Time Flies in the six-furlong maiden at 7.10. 

Having his fourth run, he looked gangly and as though he didn't know what he was doing when the jockey got serious at Windsor last time, wandering and unbalanced a furlong out  – this race is easier. 

In a competitive contest for the 14-runner six-furlong Class 4 handicap at 7.40, Encapsulated just gets the nod over Ryan Style. 

While  respecting the latter's storming effort here a week ago – finishing strongly to go second behind the front-running Ben Hall – marginal preference is for Encapsulated, who ran on very strongly from the back to pass most of the field when runner-up at Kempton last month. 

Falsify led from start to finish when beating Your Gifted here over five furlongs on August 17 and has the plum draw in stall one as she goes for the follow-up in the handicap over the same trip at 8.10. 

Ridden by season's leading jockey Silvestre de Sousa, expect the progressive three-year-old to smash the start and do the same again, while her rival is drawn on the outside in the eight-box and might struggle. 

Lastly Shifting Moon, twice a winner at Chelmsford, can make it three in the closing two-mile Class 6 handicap at 8.40. 

Main rival Grams And Ounces has won over hurdles on his last two runs, but hasn't raced on artificial surfaces for over five years.

0b1a5f88-6467-48a8-8dd5-f41d7d94f3d5,"With more than 1,800 cases and five deaths reported till September 12, Delhi-NCR is witnessing the worst outbreak of dengue since 2010. Public health professionals, however, said the worst is yet to come.       
 
“The disease normally peaks in the second and third week of October, so the numbers are going to go further up,” said Dr Ekta Gupta, additional professor at the department of virology, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. 
 
As many as 1,872 cases and five deaths have been reported in the national capital region so far, threatening to touch the high numbers of 2010 when mismanagement by civic authorities during Commonwealth Games pushed the death toll to eight with 6,259 infections reported. Of these, 1,933 cases were reported in the corresponding period, which means more than 4,300 people were infected in the peak October season. 
 
The Centre blamed the weather pattern, saying it was difficult to eliminate the disease as dengue mosquitoes get active with an increase in humidity. “An upsurge in dengue cases in many states was predicted this year because of the rain pattern, circulation of different dengue virus strains and other factors, which is why preparatory activities were started much before the transmission period in March,” said Dr Jagdish Prasad, director general of health services (DGHS), Union health ministry. 
 
The “preparatory activities”, however, seem ineffective as infections have been rising steadily with 613 reported last week compared to 428 the week before and 301 in the end of August. This year’s figures are also considerably higher than last year when 55 cases were reported till the second week of September. 
 
“The cases may be higher but the case-fatality ratio is much less… The only way to control the disease is by taking preventive measures,” Prasad said. 
 
The Delhi government, too, put the onus on the public. “As dengue mosquito breeds in fresh water, people need to be careful to not let water collect around them,” said health minister Satyendar Jain.

Former tennis star James Blake said Thursday he wants an apology from the NYPD  after he claimed he was thrown to the ground and handcuffed by several officers while leaving his Manhattan hotel .  
 
Speaking on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Blake said he was frightened during the arrest outside the Grand Hyatt Hotel on East 42nd Street Wednesday night in what the NYPD later said was a case of mistaken identity. Thursday, he said he wasn't hurt but is still ""a little shaken up."" 
 
""I'd like an apology,"" Blake said on the show. ""We all need to be held accountable for our actions, police as well."" 
 
He added, ""Most cops are doing a great job at keeping us safe, but when you police with reckless abandon, you need to be held accountable ... these that are doing police work the wrong way need to pay for their actions. They need to either be shown the door or be punished."" 
  James Blake Questioned in NYC After Identity Mistake   
Internal affairs detectives are investigating claims by former tennis professional James Blake that he was thrown to the ground and then handcuffed while mistakenly being arrested Wednesday at a Manhattan hotel, police said. Brynn Gingras reports. (Published Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2015) 
 
Blake said he has yet to be contacted by anyone with the NYPD since the exchange, which he called an instance of excessive force.  
 
""I'm happy that my reaction was that I was smiling at the person because I see if I put up my arms up or anything it could be seen as resistance and instead of a bruise I could have some broken bones or serious injuries,"" he said. 
 
He added, ""I'm lucky enough to be able to tell this story."" 
 
Blake, who is biracial, told ABC Thursday he didn't think the case was an instance of racial profiling. A day earlier, though, he told reporters he thought race played a role in the arrest. 
   Celebs in the Stands: US Open    
Undercover cops investigating a theft ring using fraudulent credit cards to make cellphone purchases were working with a delivery man to identify suspects, the NYPD says. 
 
The Daily News reported that after one of the officer's brought Blake down, he allegedly yelled, ""Don't say a word"" and commanded him to roll over. 
 
Several other cops swarmed and proceeded with the arrest until a retired NYPD officer who was working as a security guard told the cops, ""That's James Blake, the tennis player."" Blake, who was in town for the U.S. Open, told officers to look at his license and tournament credentials in their pocket.  
 
They still ran his license, Blake said Thursday. He said he told them ""the worst you're going to find is a speeding ticket.""

That's when the officers realized their mistake and apologized, according to the News, but the paper said the first officer who tackled him never said a word.  
 
In a statement to NBC 4 New York, NYPD spokesman Peter Donald said a cooperating witness had misidentified Blake and that internal affairs would investigate.  
 
""Once Blake was properly identified and found to have no connection to the investigation, he was released from police custody immediately. In regards to the alleged improper use of force, the Police Commissioner directed the internal affairs bureau to investigate,"" the statement said.  
 
Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said internal affairs detectives were sent to the hotel and have already identified ""a number of witnesses."" He says investigators are also looking to obtain surveillance video from the hotel that may have captured the arrest. 
 
One officer was placed on modified assignment following the confrontation.

744c7c46-b9d8-45db-8c83-23f82717f28e,"THE ruling CCM has vowed that if voted back to the office, will ensure land conflicts currently claiming a number of lives find permanent solution. Speaking to Mlandizi residents at Azimio Primary School grounds on Friday, the party's Presidential running mate, Ms Samia Suluhu Hassan, said 7,500 villages in 25 districts in the region have been earmarked for mapping and demarcation. 

Ms Samia said there will be land for pastoralists, farmers and reserved land and proper land use plans to end conflicts between farmers and livestock keepers. She said there's enough land but what's needed is proper land use plans in villagers whose implementation will be fully supervised if elected to form the 5th government. 

Ms Samia said the CCM presidential candidate, Dr John Pombe Magufuli, who does not entertain corruption or corrupt officials will reinforce the system and route out corrupt elements to end land conflicts. 

She noted that the land use plan, which will identify areas under pastoralists; those controlled by farmers and reserved should will be put in place by Dr Magufuli's government. 

On employment, Ms Samia said 40 per cent of youth employment in the country will come from industries. In Kibaha rural she said the Chinese Honey Industry, Energy Mill and the soon to be completed iron industry will provide a good number of employment opportunities to youth and the public in general. 

""These employment opportunities coupled with the 5th government's 50m/- to Saccos and vikoba and the 5 per cent each for women and youth groups from the district councils, we will be heading towards the right development direction and beating poverty, "" she said. 

She also promised that her government will support the council's efforts for Mlandizi to acquire a hospital and assisting with building a fence which are among needed conditions to have it upgraded as well as support other challenges. 

Earlier, the Kibaha Rural CCM parliamentary candidate, Hamoud Jumaa, said his constituency is faced with a number of challenges including meeting conditions to upgrade the health centre. 

""We have been able to build a mortuary and surgery room but we are appealing to you once Dr Magufuli is voted in to form the next government, to support build a fence to complete the conditions,"" he explained. 

Other challenges included land conflicts between farmers and pastoralists and a modern market whose budget is 5bn/- . 

On her part, the former Nkenge legislature Assumpter Mshama said the State House is not a place to hold prayer, stressing that CCM does note value voters according to religious denominations as is the case with one presidential candidate from the opposition party.",CCM Promises to Solve Mlandizi Land Conflicts,News,Individual.com,2015-09-14T13:59:50Z

e64b40da-e4ed-41ee-b8f3-ab62f1e082e0,"A shadow cabinet minister has insisted there is ""no virtue in opposition"" and warned Labour cannot change any lives without being in government. 
 
Gloria de Piero recalled the legacy of Keir Hardie in creating a political party to represent workers in Parliament as she pressed the need for Labour to return to power. 
 
Doubts have been raised over the possibility of Labour winning in 2020 following the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader, with Labour figures warning he may turn them into a ""party of protest"". 
 
Ms de Piero, t he shadow minister for young people and voter registration, told the party's conference in Brighton: ""We are Labour because we want to change people's lives. But we know we can't change a single life without being in government. 
 
""Conference debates and members' rallies, they energise us and they motivate us, but only by debating with the public and by rallying voters can we change lives. 
 
""Only by winning power locally and nationally can we change lives. 
 
""Keir Hardie died 100 years ago yesterday. His historic legacy was the creation of a political party that sought representation for labour in Parliament. Labour exists to win power, there is no virtue in opposition."" 
 
Ms de Piero also poked fun at Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour deputy leader Tom Watson. 
 
She joked: ""Lord Ashcroft has taught us a thing or two about the Prime Minister's upbringing. 
 
""It's fair to say David Cameron and I had different starts in life. Apparently he was sipping champagne on Concorde aged 11. My family were on benefits and I ate free school meals -  but we did have some things in common. 
 
""Both of us joined youth societies; he joined the Bullingdon Club, I joined Labour Students. 
   Promoted stories   
""The Bullingdon Club met at weekends to go shooting. Labour Students met at weekends to campaign in key seats. 
 
""They'd stay up all night at the Tory black and white ball. We'd stay up all night at Labour conference compositing. 
 
""They had some interesting initiation ceremonies, but I had to share a flat with Tom Watson.  I don't know who had the worst deal."" 
 
Shadow women and equalities minister Kate Green also insisted Labour would ""campaign and resist"" Government measures that ""hold back progress on equality"". 
 
She said: "" We will toughen up the law on hate crime. 
 
""We will not tolerate the abuse and contempt suffered by those who rely on our welfare state and are stigmatised as scroungers. 
 
""And we will call out the language of division - because we are a united country."" 
 
Ms Green also said: ""Parliament continues to be an institution designed by men, for men.  Securing equal representation at every level in elected office must be Labour's task.""

0f56383f-d469-44a9-baa3-2c603efc8b79,"NAPLES, Fla. - If last week was any indication, the First Baptist Academy football team will be fired up for Friday’s game at Southwest Florida Christian. 

Coming off a bye, the Lions bounced back from a 36-point loss in Week 2 by pouncing on Evangelical Christian last week. First Baptist went up 35-0 in the game’s first 16 minutes before winning 48-0. 

Lions coach Billy Sparacio said he saw a different demeanor from his team as it started its lengthy district schedule. Class 2A-District 7, including First Baptist, is the largest in Southwest Florida with seven teams, meaning league play began early in the season. 

The district schedule continues this week at Southwest Florida Christian. Sparacio said his team, three-time defending district champions, understands the importance of these games and acts accordingly. 

“The preparation and focus for these games (is better),” Sparacio said. “There’s more excitement, a little more energy. There’s more intensity throughout the week as the games get closer.” 

First Baptist was led by its defense, which earned its first shutout since Week 1 of last season. The Lions held Evangelical Christian to 79 yards. 

This week the Lions face a much more potent offense. Southwest Florida Christian (3-1) averages 283.3 yards and 32.8 points per game. 

Senior Tristan Upton has rushed for 279 yards and four touchdowns for the Kings, who run for 174.3 yards per game. Upton had 1,033 yards and 16 touchdowns last season. 

Though the Kings run the ball first, they can throw it, too. Quarterback Justin Vazquez has completed 27 of 63 passes for 436 yards and six touchdowns with one interception. 

Like First Baptist, Southwest Florida Christian also is coming off a 48-0 victory to open their district schedule. The Kings won at St. John Neumann last week. 

“Our defensive coaches do a really, really good job preparing the kids for Friday night,” Sparacio said. “Our defensive staff (coordinator Matt Jansen and defensive backs coach David Batiato) do a very good job getting kids mentally prepared for what they’re going to see.” 

The strength of the Lions’ defense has been its linebackers. Sophomore Joe Sparacio, the coach’s son, had 15 tackles last week, while fellow sophomore Rainer Schurig had 13. A two-way player, Sparacio also caught an 80-yard touchdown pass as a fullback against Evangelical Christian, and ran for a touchdown. 

The offense got a shot in the arm last week with the return of Dylan Cibelli. Cibelli is the leading returning rusher from last season, when he ran for 593 yards. However, he missed the first two games with injuries. 

Cibelli ran for 167 yards and three touchdowns last week on five carries. 

“He was fired up about getting back out there,” Sparacio said. “He showed he’s ready to go. He gives us more depth and another guy who can take it to the house.”",Football: FBA trying to build off blowout,News,Naples Daily News,2015-09-24T17:12:15Z

Allan McNeill, 66, of Greenock, has only months to live and asked for a move to Port Glasgow so his daughter can help care for him. 
 
But his traumatised wife Mary told the Tele that River Clyde Homes (RCH) took those hopes away — by putting the couple at the bottom of the housing list. 
 
Now they are pleading with the housing association to reconsider before it is too late. 
 
Despite getting letters of support from doctors, Mary and Allan have been told that they are not a priority. 
 
The couple — whose son Ryan was killed in a knife attack last year — say they feel they have been abandoned. 
 
In another cruel twist Mary told how she had even packed up her flat because she had been told that RCH had a place in Port Glasgow for them. 
 
Mary, 65, of Rankin Court, said: “I am begging them to give Allan his dying wish. 
 
“This is his last act to look after me before he dies. 
 
“He has everything else in order — but he wanted me to get help from my daughter while I cared for him in his final weeks. 
 
“I have my own health problems and he wants the peace of mind of knowing that I am alright when he is gone. 
 
“Our son Ryan was killed last year and he used to look after us both, and Allan is worried about how I will cope nursing him. 
 
“He thinks they are just waiting for him to die so they don’t need to do anything.” 
 
The couple say they were left reeling at the housing snub because they thought a move was on the cards. 
 
Mary added: “We have had doctors writing letters of support and Inverclyde Advocacy has been acting on our behalf. 
 
“They called me to say River Clyde Homes had a flat in Thistle Court in Port Glasgow for us. 
 
My family came round and we started packing. 
 
“An occupational therapist came to visit us and she said that she would do what she could. 
 
“She said that the flat in Thistle Court had a bath and she would see about getting a shower.” 
 
But after that visit Mary and Allan received a letter to tell them that their housing request had been turned down 
 
Mary said: “I feel totally and utterly betrayed. 
 
“I have begged them, I have bared my soul but nothing seems to work. They are heartless.” 
 
Allan, who suffered from heart and lung disease, was told in Feburary that he had terminal cancer that had spread to vital organs like his liver and into his bones. 
 
The family, already grieving over the horrific loss of their son Ryan, were devastated all over again. Allan decided that he wanted Mary to be closer to her daughter so that she was not alone in caring for him in his final months. 
 
They made a request to be placed in River Clyde Homes’ group one category — ‘an internal transfer to improve quality of life for the frail and mobility impaired’. 
 
But instead RCH officials put them in the lowest priority group six — ‘no assessed housing need but aspiring to locate to a new home’. 
 
Their daughter Karen Ward, 44, is furious at the stance the housing association has taken. 
 
She said: “I feel utterly helpless. 
 
“We need to be together. 
 
“We have all been to hell and back in the last year. 
 
“I have three children and I work, so I help as much as I can. 
 
“If they stayed in Port Glasgow I could pop in and out all the time. 
 
“I can’t believe how heartless River Clyde Homes are.” 
 
The family hope a final, last-ditch appeal can persuade River Clyde to change their minds but Mary is dismayed and not optimistic. 
 
She said: “It looks like it is too late for us but I hope this might shame River Clyde Homes and another family will never be put through this again. 
 
Julie Allison, Your Home Lettings Manager at River Clyde Homes, said: “We are aware of the McNeill family’s situation and are sympathetic to their case. 
 
“However, in terms of their housing need they are adequately accommodated in a home that meets their physical needs, and this is the over-riding factor in this case. 
 
“There are other applicants who are physically unable to live in their homes. 
 
“These people have a greater priority under our lettings policy; one that aims to be fair and equitable across the housing stock for all customers.” 
 
River Clyde Homes added that they have met with the family to discuss widening their choice of houses – but Mary and Allan told the Tele they dispute this point.

On Thursday, a federal judge finally put an end to Kim Davis's mission from God . Davis—whose crusade to prevent gay couples in her Kentucky county from receiving marriage licenses after the legalization of same-sex marriage—is now headed behind bars. 

The American Civil Liberties union filed two motions on Tuesday to hold Davis in contempt of court. Although they requested that the clerk only receive steep fines, US District Judge David Bunning ruled differently, sentencing her to jail, the Associated Press reported . 

""You can't be separated from something that's in your heart and in your soul,"" said Davis, who reportedly stood before Judge Bunning for 20 minutes before a US Marshal removed her from the room without using handcuffs.

a6a8cdea-33e7-46c2-a861-d404aae9c100,"While cities across the state pull red light cameras amid court challenges and complaints, Clearwater has continued its program for another two years under a revised system that may be tougher to challenge legally. 
     
The new contract approved Aug. 20 removed authority from RedFlex Traffic Systems so the company has no involvement in reviewing violations. Giving too much power to a for-profit-vendor was the crux of an October appeals court decision that ruled the red light cameras in Hollywood, Fla., were illegal. 
 
Until the renegotiated contract was approved last month, Clearwater's program functioned similarly to Hollywood's, with Redflex in control of prescreening possible violations before forwarding them to the Clearwater Police Department. 
 
""If somebody brings litigation against us now, they're going after the mere fact we're using red light cameras,"" said City Manager Bill Horne. 
 
Redflex is being sued by the city of Chicago for more than $300 million on allegations the company bribed city officials into a contract, but Horne said that litigation does not affect Clearwater's relationship with the company. 
 
About 26,000 tickets have been issued since Clearwater's two cameras went live in July 2012, monitoring both directions of Gulf-to-Bay Boulevard at Belcher Road and eastbound traffic at S Fort Harrison Avenue and Chestnut Street, according to city data. The violations have garnered $860,275 in revenue for the city as of Aug. 26, with $444,362 paid to RedFlex. 
 
Data also show that as cameras rolled, accidents at those intersections increased. 
 
In the 12 months before the cameras, there were 29 crashes at Gulf to Bay and Belcher, jumping to 120 between July 2012 and June 2013, 104 the next year and 65 between July 2014 and February 2015, the most recent data available. 
 
At Chestnut and Fort Harrison, crashes increased from two in the year before the cameras to nine between July 2012 and June 2013, 11 the next year and 14 between July 2014 and February 2015. 
 
Clearwater police Chief Daniel Slaughter said it is impossible to judge the safety of the cameras on accidents alone because many other factors contribute to vehicle collisions. In the three years since the cameras went live, the Gulf to Bay and Belcher intersection has been built up with development, adding driver distractions, Slaughter said. 
 
""The problem with trying to evaluate crashes is there's too many other factors,"" he said. ""There's no comparing apples to apples."" 
 
After a driver runs a red light and an image of the plate is captured, the data is transmitted to the Redflex system in Arizona, where an employee matches the tag to the Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles database. 
 
Redflex then forwards that information to the Clearwater Police Department, and a traffic enforcement officer determines if a violation occurs. 
 
All at-fault drivers can expect a $158 citation from RedFlex in the mail. 
 
Redflex software to be installed at the intersections Oct. 31 will automatically filter out false positives, like right-turns on red and cars that pass the stop bar, but come to a screeching halt without running the light. 
 
Under the old contract, Reflex employees screened false positives, creating a similar power dynamic to Hollywood's system that the courts ruled was illegal. 
 
Since the Florida Legislature authorized red light cameras in 2010, challenges to the programs have been steady. 
 
In March, two Broward County judges dismissed 24,000 red light tickets, ruling the program in Fort Lauderdale violated state law. This year Kenneth City, St. Petersburg and Brooksville voted to end their programs, and at least seven jurisdictions terminated their cameras before the end of fiscal year 2014, according to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles most recent report. 
 
Ted Hollander, a partner in the Ticket Clinic law firm, which has helped thousands of drivers fight citations, said court challenges have been successful because of the inherent flaws in the system. 
 
""Studies have shown that the red light cameras cause accidents,"" he said. ""They cause rear end collisions. Accidents go up. The safety benefit has been nonexistent. It's a money maker. It's a tax on people that live here and visit."" 
 
Slaughter disagreed, saying the cameras are no different than an officer writing tickets at an intersection, and if they prevent even one death, they are worthwhile. 
 
""It's simple,"" he said. ""If you don't run the red light, you don't have a problem.""

f57a1773-f932-49fd-847f-8daa293be415,"HARTFORD, Conn. -- Federal regulators are halting a five-year study of the risk of cancer in communities around six U.S. nuclear plants and a nuclear fuel site. 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Tuesday remaining work on a pilot study would take too long, at more than three years, and cost too much, at $8 million. It's already spent $1.5 million. Completing the pilot study and subsequent nationwide reviews could take eight to 10 years. 

The commission said radiation releases, when they occur, are too small to cause observable increases in cancer risk. 

Anti-nuclear power group Beyond Nuclear said halting the study is outrageous and that funding it is a legitimate cost.

“We are cognizant of the fact that we had implemented the new tariff for banks utilizing the ‘Additional Feature’ meaning the transfer of money from a bank account to third-party M-Pesa customer and shall revert back to the previous tariff’s effective 25th August 2015 The tariffs in force prior to 1st August 2015 shall continue to apply until 30 November 2015” wrote Rita Okuthe Safaricom’s Director of Enterprise Unit in a letter dated 25th August 2015 Safaricom also distanced itself from the introduction of the transfer of money from customers’ bank accounts to third-party M-Pesa wallets -which it now refers to as the “Additional Feature”

“Safaricom introduced the bank to M-pesa functionality primarily to enable customers’ access their bank accounts from their mobile phone However some financial institutions later introduced a new transaction arrangement that enabled their customers to send money from their bank accounts to the M-pesa accounts of third parties the “Additional Feature”” wrote Okuthe

On 1st of August 2015 Safaricom effected tariff changes for third party transactions for Equitel which had increased on a graduated scale from Ksh22 for amounts falling between Ksh50 and Ksh1000 Sh75 for customers sending 5001 to 7500 to a high of Ksh110 for amounts between Ksh20001 and Ksh70000

However the telecommunication company has now reverted to charging a flat rate of Ksh33 to Equitel customers till 30th November 2015 when revised charges will apply to all financial institutions

It is expected that from 1st December 2015 customers transferring cash from any bank account to third party M-Pesa accounts will incur additional costs for amounts exceeding Sh1 500 Safaricom has for example upped charges by 2666 per cent to Sh121 from Sh33 for those transferring Sh35 000 Those moving Sh70 000 from their bank accounts to M-Pesa will incur additional Sh77 which is a 2333 per cent increase

Equity Bank had written to Central Bank of Kenya objecting the increased charges by Safaricom terming the move as not only a discouragement to the adoption of viable alternatives but also a threat to ‘the deepening financial inclusion’ in the country

At the same time Equity Bank confirmed that money transfer from one mobile phone or bank account to another within the Equity ecosystem still attracts ZERO charges Equitel subscribers sending money to another mobile network are charged at 1percent of the transaction amount up to a maximum charge of Sh25

3b41c9ff-f196-4f54-a7cd-860519f83f79,"Rooney denies asking to leave Man Utd  
London (AFP) - Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney claims that he did not submit a transfer request shortly before Alex Ferguson retired as manager in May 2013. 

Rooney came close to leaving United in October 2010 and Ferguson has alleged that the England striker also asked to leave the club two years ago. 

Rooney sat out Ferguson's final two games as United manager, but in a new documentary, he says that he never explicitly asked to leave Old Trafford. 

""I went in to see him (Ferguson) and just said, 'If you are not going to play me, it might be better for me to move on,'"" Rooney says in Wayne Rooney: The Man Behind The Goals, which will be broadcast by the BBC next week. 

""Then, all of a sudden, it was all over the press that I had put a transfer request in, which I never did. I don't know what happened and why that came out that way."" 

Rooney, 29, admits that his relationship with Ferguson was occasionally strained, but describes the Scot, who is now a United director, as ""the best manager of all time"". 

Other revelations in the documentary include an admission that the burly striker wooed his wife Coleen, who is pregnant with their third child, by writing her poetry during the early days of their relationship. 

He also concedes that he was wrong to play for England at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, having fractured a metatarsal bone in his right foot six weeks before the tournament. 

""Before the World Cup in Germany I broke my foot at Chelsea,"" Rooney says. 

""You could feel the excitement building around the World Cup and it was touch and go as to whether I would be fit. And then Sven (Goran Eriksson, then England manager) put me in the squad. 

""Looking back, if I could have gone back in time, then I probably would have sat out the World Cup. It was a big ask to get fit after six weeks out. I was never going to have that match sharpness."" 

Rooney was sent off during England's quarter-final loss to Portugal for stamping on Ricardo Carvalho and clashed with his United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo after the latter seemed to urge the referee to send Rooney off. 

But the pair reconciled, inspiring United to three consecutive Premier League titles and the 2007-08 Champions League trophy, and Ronaldo says in the film that they may yet play together again. 

""We won every trophy together. He's a fantastic boy and he helped me a lot,"" says the Real Madrid forward. ""It was amazing to play with him. But the future, nobody knows. Maybe we will play one day together again.""",Rooney denies asking to leave Man Utd (AFP),News,Yahoo! News Australia,2015-09-29T10:05:10Z

Satellite images show the main temple in Syria's Palmyra has been flattened, confirming the worst fears for the ancient ruins held by the Islamic State group. 

The destruction of the Temple of Bel sparked outrage and international headlines, precisely the reaction the jihadist group may have been seeking, experts said.

The UN's cultural watchdog called it an ""intolerable crime against civilisation"". 

Dozens of relics remain at risk in the ruins of Palmyra, which IS jihadists seized from regime forces in May as they pursued their campaign for territory in Syria and Iraq. 

The extremist group's harsh philosophy condemns pre-Islamic religious sites and considers statues and grave markers to be idolatrous, but it has also been accused of destroying heritage to loot items for the black market and to gain publicity.

Satellite images taken before and after an explosion at Palmyra on Sunday ""confirm the destruction of the main Temple of Bel as well as a row of columns in its immediate vicinity,"" UN training and research agency UNITAR said. 

The 2,000-year-old temple was the centrepiece of Palmyra's famed ruins and one of the most important relics at the UNESCO-listed heritage site.

""The Temple of Bel was the most beautiful symbol of all of Syria."" 

""It was the most beautiful place to visit,"" Syrian antiquities director Maamoun Abdulkarim told AFP by telephone from Damascus. 

""And we have lost it forever."" 

IS fighters seized Palmyra from Syrian regime forces on May 21.

While antiquities staff evacuated most of the city's museum before IS arrived, the group destroyed an ornate lion statue outside the building and also mined Palmyra's ruins. 

Last month the jihadists beheaded the 82-year old former antiquities chief in Palmyra and destroyed the ancient shrine of Baal Shamin. 

' They have killed Palmyra '

On Sunday, activists and a monitor reported a large explosion at the site had destroyed the Temple of Bel. 

Abdulkarim said Palmyra's remaining ruins include ""dozens of the greatest grave markers, the amphitheatre, and the Temple of Nabu, which only has its foundations."" 

The city's grand Roman amphitheatre, which dates from between the second and third century, is not believed to have been damaged.

But it was the scene of a gruesome massacre shortly after IS seized Palmyra, with child members of the group killing 25 soldiers. 

""They have killed Palmyra. Now, they will terrorise it,"" Abdulkarim said. 

""It's the last warning before the complete destruction of Palmyra."" 

Cheikhmous Ali of the Association for the Protection of Syrian Archeology described the razing of the ruins as ""a way to pressure and torture the local population - to suppress their history and their collective memory."" 

It was also an attempt to ""remain in the headlines"", he said, warning: 

""The more we give IS's savage actions media attention, the more they will repeat this.""

UNESCO chief Irina Bokova expressed ""deep distress"" over the temple's destruction, but vowed it would ""not erase 4,500 years of history"". 

Washington added its voice to the chorus of condemnation and warned countries and individuals against supporting IS by trafficking and selling looted Syrian treasures. 

""All those who destroy important cultural property must be held accountable,"" said State Department spokesman Mark Toner. 

' Symbolic power' in destruction 
 
Gruesome violence and the destruction of priceless artefacts have become hallmarks of IS as it expands its so-called ""caliphate"" straddling Iraq and Syria. 

In addition to damaging sites in Syria, IS has destroyed statues, shrines, and manuscripts in the Iraqi city of Mosul, and demolished the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud. 

Charlie Winter, an analyst with the London-based Quilliam Foundation, said the destruction ""makes sense with the jihadist worldview, because these temples are symbols of polytheism."" 
Islamic State militants have blown up one of the most important temples in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra, accelerating their relentless campaign of destruction against the historical treasures Photo: SANA via AP 
""They are pre-Islamic and are considered by IS not to be worthy of existence,"" Winter said. 

He agreed IS may be seeking to reclaim headlines at a time when its gruesome killings no longer receive the same media attention as before. 

The militants have used sophisticated media techniques to gain publicity and lure thousands of foreigners to join their ranks. 

""The videos IS publishes of people being burned alive don't grab headlines anywhere near as much as headlines about Palmyra do,"" Winter said. 

IS ""has recognised the symbolic power of destroying these ruins.

""If there's anything IS revels in, it's condemnation"" of its actions, he said. 

Regime forces have launched an offensive to retake the ancient city and as they edge closer the jihadist group may be looking to sow as much destruction as it can. 

""The more likely it looks that IS will end up losing Palmyra, the more likely it will destroy what's left there,"" Winter said.","It's official, the Palmyra temple has been blown up",News,Yahoo! News Australia,2015-09-02T02:01:21Z

American Airlines Flight 1284, which departed from Miami, ended up landing in Indianapolis. 

The female passenger became unruly during the flight, according to an Indianapolis Airport Authority spokesman. 

“She was disoriented through the entire flight,” passenger Marian Frendt told ABC station WLS-TV in Chicago. “She started kicking the seat of the passenger in front of her, and he apparently turned around to complain … and she hit him.” 

When a flight attendant intervened, the woman allegedly grabbed the attendant’s face and kissed her, then punched her in the face. 

Authorities said the woman also kicked a police officer while being arrested. 

The woman — who has not been identified — was escorted off the plane in flex-cuffs. Passengers filmed the scene as officers helped her into the back of a patrol car. 

She was charged with battery with injury, battery without injury, battery of a public safety officer, criminal recklessness, disorderly conduct and disruption the operation of an aircraft, authorities said. 

The disruption caused the flight to arrive in Chicago about 90 minutes late.

(Renuka Rayasam is a Berlin-based writer. The opinions
expressed are her own.) 
 
By Renuka Rayasam 
 
Sept 30 (Reuters) - There is no shortage of jokes about the
German language. Mark Twain practically has the crowded market
cornered, but Richard Porson, an 18th century English classics
scholar, summed up the prevailing sentiment with his quip ""Life
is too short to learn German."" 
 
Now the German language is turning out to be more than just
the butt of jokes. In a country desperately in need of workers,
it is proving to be a stumbling block that prevents German
companies from taking advantage of the flood of new arrivals,
from the Middle East and elsewhere in the European Union. 
   
Last year the country became the second-most popular
destination for permanent migration, ahead of Canada and the
United Kingdom. Dismal economic conditions in other European
Union member states such as Greece, Spain and Italy have
prompted residents of those countries to try their luck finding
jobs in Germany. With the vast numbers of migrants fleeing war
and arriving on Germany's doorstep, migration to the country
shows no signs of slowing. 
 
Yet more than 30 percent of German employers surveyed by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2013
said that the reason they didn't look to foreign workers to fill
job openings was potential candidates' lack of German language
skills. These skills are both a legal and cultural requirement:
while workers in the EU don't need a visa to work in Germany,
they often need to know the language to get through the
bureaucratic hurdles like certification exams and to fit into
German workplace culture. 
 
""Many migrants with the needed skills would like to come to
Germany to work, but there are high barriers to overcome. The
German language itself is one obstacle,"" Yves Leterme, the then
deputy secretary-general of the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development said at a Berlin conference two
years ago. 
 
Blame the lingering effects of British colonialism or
perhaps American pop culture, but language is far less of a
problem in long-standing English-speaking immigrant destinations
such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. 
 
In some sectors of the German economy, English is also the
lingua franca. German is rarely spoken in Berlin's start-up
technology sector, for example. Among Germany's major
international companies like Bayer, German may be spoken in the
halls and cantina, but English is the official work language. 
 
In the country's so-called ""Mittelstand,"" or mid-sized
companies, however, business is often done in German, which has
so far prevented them from tapping international talent. 
 
Unlike technology start-ups, which tend to be clustered in
international cities like Berlin, Mittelstand firms are
scattered in small towns throughout Germany. And unlike major
international companies, they are often family-owned and
historically have rarely looked outside Germany to hire
employees. 
 
But as Germany overtakes English-speaking countries to
become a leading destination for immigrants, that attitude is
starting to change. With an aging population and low birthrate,
these ""Mittelstand"" businesses, often heralded as the engine of
Germany's economic growth, see the swell of workers from abroad
as a potential boon that can keep the economy humming along by
filling jobs. 
 
These days construction firm Josef Hebel GmbH, in the
southern German town of Memmingen, regularly recruits
non-German-speaking workers from around the world in order to
fill jobs that would previously have been filled with native
German speakers. About 52 of the company's 430 workers and
trainees are from other countries, including six employees and
trainees from Italy through Memmingen's partnership with the
city of Teramo and one trainee who fled Sierra Leone. 
 
Josef Hebel chief executive Wolfgang Dorn told me that he
started offering more language classes for these new hires.
After a year of German language classes, Hebel's foreign workers
can speak at a high enough level to get around construction
sites and effectively perform their jobs, but not well enough to
pass certification exams they need to stay and work in the
country. 
 
German policymakers have long realized that learning German
could be a major hurdle in matching immigrants to open jobs, and
have taken the approach of fostering language learning among new
arrivals. A major immigration overhaul, implemented in 2005, not
only loosened up restrictions for people from abroad seeking
work in Germany, but also offered free language and integration
classes to immigrants. 
 
In 2012 Germany adopted the European Union's Blue Card,
which grants work visas to immigrants with a university degree
and a job offer guaranteeing a certain minimum salary of between
36,000 euros and 47,000 euros ($40,500 and $52,900) depending on
the sector. It also waives the language requirement of other
German work visa categories, which can require proof of
intermediate language ability. 
 
Many of the steps that the German government has taken to
welcome immigrants are to correct the mistakes that the country
made when it invited guest workers from Turkey and other
countries in the 1950s and 1960s, according to Dr. Jochen Oltmer
at the Institute for Immigration Research and Intercultural
Studies at the University of Osnabrück. Back then, Germany
didn't bother to invest in language and integration classes
because policymakers and companies never expected them to stay,
and the work they were doing required little more than basic
German. With uncertain visa statuses they also often had no
incentive to invest in language learning. 
 
Because many of these immigrants didn't learn German very
quickly, they had trouble getting more permanent visas and
filling openings for skilled workers even if they were educated. 
 
Still, even though the number of free German classes has
blossomed since the 2005 immigration law, Oltmer says that there
are limits to what they can accomplish. ""There are a lot of
disadvantages to these German classes,"" he said. ""The German
they teach is very formal, very textbook and not always
relevant."" 
 
Josef Hebel head Dorn agrees that learning the language is
important for his employees to conduct basic business, but that
they don't need to have the native proficiency required to get
German certifications. He believes instead that the local
Bavarian state government should start offering the
qualification exams in the employee's mother tongue to help keep
trained workers on the job and in the country. 
 
""We offer more and more German lessons, but after a full day
of work it's hard for them to sit in a language class,"" said
Dorn. ""It's not so easy to learn German - it's a huge
challenge.""

4b4e29e0-6e43-4e1d-87c6-d65af5489872,"Last week’s first live televised forum of the governor’s race on Louisiana Public Broadcasting snuck up on most political observers, says Jeremy Alford. 
 
“Even those tracking the race closely didn’t know it would be on TV until the week prior—and few cared until they discovered U.S. Sen. David Vitter would not be participating,” Alford writes in his latest column, noting the Vitter camp insists it never agreed to be on the stage, so technically it didn’t miss the gathering. “Still, it certainly doesn’t look good that Vitter wasn’t present to field questions from students, who organized the event.” 
 
Regardless of why Vitter was absent from last week’s forum, there are sure to be plenty more opportunities for him to take the stage with the other leading candidates before this fall’s election, says Alford. But even if that happens, he says, don’t hold your waiting for a truly unscripted exchange between the candidates. 
 
“To secure all of the serious players for a televised forum the event organizers will likely have to reveal the questions ahead of time and limit opportunities for the candidates to address each other,” Alford writes. “This is not a new trend and we’ve seen it repeatedly in recent election cycles.” 
 
The art of the political debate is dead in Louisiana, says Alford, especially for top-tier contests like governor. 
 
“Candidates do not discuss opposing points of view. They don’t question each other or draw distinctions,” he writes. “Instead, politicians more times than not participate in forums that are as scripted as soap operas.” 
 
WRKF radio in Baton Rouge actually hosted an unscripted event during the final week of August, says Alford—and all of the candidates backed out except Dardenne. 
 
“It doesn’t really matter to the candidates if they miss such events,” he writes. “After all, voters can still see them in commercials if their campaigns can afford statewide buys on broadcast and cable. It has created an environment where the most memorable moments from forums are not substantive exchanges on policy, but rather the rapid trading of words that candidates tuck into their responses.”

2992b88d-917d-41d6-8f73-b64abfb1faf8,"Days after area residents bemoan forest dept's lack of action, migrant labourer mauled while returning from work through densely forested shortcut; villagers struck by fear 
Days after it was reported that panicked Wagholi residents had beseeched authorities to do something about the leopard on the prowl in their area, the same animal has mauled a man. 

On Saturday evening, a labourer was attacked by a leopard while returning home from work. While he did not sustain any serious injuries, he was rushed to Sassoon hospital, where he was vaccinated and kept under observation till Sunday morning. 

Victim Jaiprakash Dwivedi, covered with angry red scratches, said he had stopped to answer nature's call on the way, when the incident occurred. ""It was a leopard cub that attacked me. There was no one in the vicinity and shouting would not have helped. I somehow escaped and ran back home. Had it been a full-grown beast, I would not have survived. Once home, people took me to the hospital,"" he said. 

Several other such migrant labourers regularly march through the same, forested route — covered in trees and dense grass — because it is an easy shortcut for them to return after work in the city. While the attack on Dwivedi has struck fear in their hearts, they are largely helpless about route options. 

""The shortcut is a straight route through the foliage-covered area — a half hour's walk to our workplaces nearby. If we took any other route, we would have to take a detour from Chokhi Dani, adding at least three or four kilometres to the walk. If we go late to work, our employers pull us up. We have no option other than this route. Now, we are very scared but will try to be extremely alert when we walk from there,"" said Arun Kumar Pande, Dwivedi's neighbour in the little community full of migrant labourers. 

Villager Shravan Pande offered, ""Despite our fear, we cannot come and go together, because all our duty timings are different. We have to walk alone through this area."" 

Mirror had reported on September 10 about frequent sightings of leopards by villagers at Awalwadi in Wagholi as well as a dog being picked up from a gated compound, which a leopard entered from an adjacent tree. At the time, the forest department had also said that chances were high that this was the same female leopard and her two cubs that had been recently reported as sighted at Sinhagad; the family was predicted to move to Daund gradually. 

Usman Dilawar Sayyad, the watchman at the farmhouse where a leopard entered earlier this month and picked up a puppy, said, ""We have been insisting that the forest department trap the leopard, but all they have done is kept an empty cage in the grass. It is not just me — many other villagers have sighted the animal. But the authorities are still not taking us seriously."" 

Local resident Anwar Khan told Mirror,""We have even offered the forest department to put our own bait in the empty cage. But they have just asked us to wait. These days, people stay at home unless absolutely necessary to venture out."" 

Kesharbai Awale, another local, claims to have seen a leopard attacking her cattle a week ago. ""The forest department officials came on Sunday morning and I told them whatever I knew. I have lived here for many years, but have never seen a leopard attack. When I came out to see what the commotion was when my cattle made some noise, I saw a leopard and froze. Now, I constantly fear for my life,"" she said. 

Range forest officer Devyani Punde Ruplag said, ""Although we have not seen the pugmarks yet, we think it could be a leopard, evidenced from scratches on the tree that was climbed to get into the farmhouse. We have kept a cage there and applied for permission from the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) to trap the animal. The wounds on the victim are not deep and there are no bites, so it was probably a leopard cub. Meanwhile, villagers have been told to stay alert.""",Leopard attacks Wagholi labourer,News,Pune Mirror,2015-09-13T21:50:32Z
d3efcc6f-19cb-4d2d-b3ea-e3ad6c3d7c2e,"Katherinites set to take flight for first time since 2004. 

KATHERINE’S embattled airport will welcome a commercial flight for the first time in more than a decade on October 19.

Transport Minister Peter Chandler announced this morning that the Northern Territory government had signed an air services agreement with regional operator Airnorth that will link Katherine with Darwin, Tennant Creek and Alice Springs during a two-year trial.

The government flagged the trial in August 2014 in a bid to “test the market” and reintroduce a regular passenger transport service to provide a road alternative to access towns on the Stuart Highway.

Airnorth will operate the service using an Embraer E120 aircraft on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

Mr Chandler said the long-awaited “milk run” represented the final piece of the puzzle to connect the NT.

“Look, I am excited, because it connects the Territory,” he told the Katherine Times after he made the announcement on September 10.

“I know everyone talks about the Stuart Highway and driving … and I really think [an RPT service] is the final bolt-on that we need.

“You’ve got planes that fly over all these places but to actually connect the towns is the icing on the cake.”​

He added that the government had budgeted for a full two-year trial, irrespective of its success, but said he believed daily commercial flights could be landing in Katherine well before it concluded.

“We’ve already budgeted for it, so the two years is a commitment ,” he said.

“It won’t take more than two years to establish itself as a rock-solid service and it’s possible it could end up running five days a week.

“I want the government to support it by making sure their own public servants use it wherever possible.”

Member for Katherine Willem Westra van Holthe said the trial would boost economic opportunities for the region, adding that the long-term future of the RPT service would hinge on how well it was supported by the community.

You’ve got planes that fly over all these places but to actually connect the towns is the icing on the cake. - Transport Minister Peter Chandler 

“The Katherine community has been crying out for this route for some time,” he said.

“This is the first regular air service for Katherine and Tennant Creek since 2004, when the previous service became commercially unviable.

“I’d encourage residents and business owners to support the service, cementing its place in the region for years to come.”

The announcement has been welcomed by Katherine’s tourism sector.

Nitmiluk Tours general manager Tony Clementson said he believed the RPT service could be a “game changer” that had the potential to put the region on the doorstep of tourists who did not have the time to undertake a traditional driving holiday, especially during the wet season.

“I think it’s great news,” he said.

“I think it opens up the region to a whole new audience.

“It will make a big difference to people who are time poor, or who are holidaying in the Top End and aren’t driving.”

Despite the celebration surrounding the announcement, the future of Katherine Airport still hangs in the balance as Katherine Town Council waits to make a decision on whether or not it will cease operation of the facility, which it described last year as being in a “rather dilapidated condition”.

Prior to a backflip at its June 24, 2014 ordinary meeting, the council had voted to withdraw immediately from running the embattled facility, described by the NT government as having “vital importance” to both Katherine and adjacent communities.

While the council has undertaken considerable consultation with other stakeholders over the past 14 months, including the Department of Defence and Department of Transport, it is yet to finalise its plan for the future of the facility.

5b776f1e-bb5c-49a6-8fb3-af2c31fbf20d,"COSTA MESA, Calif., Sept. 29, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TTM Technologies, Inc. ( Nasdaq:TTMI ), a major global printed circuit board (""PCB"") manufacturer, today announced that it plans to close three facilities in order to improve total plant utilization, operational performance and customer focus. Manufacturing operations in Cleveland, Ohio and Milpitas, California will be combined with nearby TTM locations in North Jackson, Ohio and Silicon Valley, California, respectively. TTM's electronic manufacturing solutions (E-MS) facility in Juarez, Mexico will be closed. The plant closures are part of a comprehensive integration plan that the company commenced following the acquisition of Viasystems on May 31, 2015. 

TTM will offer customers of the affected plants uninterrupted support at its remaining 25 manufacturing sites worldwide. 
   
""Following our acquisition of Viasystems, we initiated a thorough evaluation of utilization rates, technology mix and customer requirements at all our facilities,"" said Tom Edman, President and CEO of TTM Technologies. ""We expect the actions we are announcing today will improve total plant utilization and reduce the geographic and manufacturing capabilities overlap of our PCB facilities in North America and will allow us to increase the focus of our E-MS business through coordinated consolidation. We will be working with our customers to transfer as much business as possible to other facilities in our footprint.""    

""These are extremely difficult decisions, and we realize these actions will have a significant impact on the lives of our dedicated employees at the Cleveland, Milpitas and Juarez facilities. We will work with our employees to assist them through the transition."" 

Over the next three to six months, TTM will close the three affected sites and, where appropriate, transfer employees to other facilities nearby. Separation and other benefits will be extended to those employees who are not transferred to another TTM facility. The company expects a total headcount reduction of approximately 550 employees in conjunction with the plant closures and consolidation.  

The company expects to record between $15 and $20 million in separation, asset impairment and disposal costs related to this restructuring primarily between now and June 30, 2016. Approximately 50% of these costs will be in the form of cash expenditures and the rest in the form of non-cash charges. These actions will have no impact on TTM's non-GAAP third quarter 2015 results and the company remains on track to achieve its previously reported third quarter 2015 guidance of revenue in the range of $640 million to $680 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.14 to $0.20 per diluted share. Today's actions are expected to yield annual cost savings of approximately $16.5 million and the company believes it remains on track to achieve its annualized synergy goal of at least $55 million associated with the integration of Viasystems. 

Investor Conference Call and Webcast 

TTM will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, September 29, 2015 at 8:30 AM Eastern Time to discuss the plant combinations and closure. The conference call may include forward-looking statements. 

Telephone access is available by dialing domestic 1-888-428-9480 or international 1-719-325-2429 (ID 623020). The conference call also will be webcast on TTM's website at www.ttm.com .

6704c8fd-e344-4087-9356-5f244be77d5f,"Queen Elizabeth II thanks supporters around world for 'touching messages of great kindness' but was determined to make as little of the occasion as possible. 

London: ""A few seconds ago the Queen entered the history books as the longest-reigning monarch in British history…""

Britain loves a bit of royal pageantry: yacht flotillas, glittering carriages, marching bands and rows upon rows of fuzzy hats and glinting bayonets.

But one of the more remarkable moments in Queen Elizabeth II's reign passed on Wednesday afternoon (early morning in Australia), with little more than an awkward pause on BBC television, followed by the above announcement by the presenter.

Queen Elizabeth II has now ruled the UK (and, of course, Australia) for 63 years, seven months and two days, beating Queen Victoria's record.

Though it is impossible to be sure when the record was passed – Elizabeth's father King George VI died in his sleep at Sandringham – the country decided to mark the exact moment at 5.30pm.

Elizabeth, now 89, was 25 at the time she became Queen.

It was not immediately clear where the Queen was at that moment in time.

Buckingham Palace had made it clear that she did not want to make a fuss, and wanted it to be a normal working day for the royal family.

According to some media reports at 5.30pm she was at Balmoral, her summer residence in Scotland, accompanied by her husband and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their two children, among other dinner guests.

It can only be speculated that she marked the moment with her favourite daytime drink: a gin and Dubonnet (according to royal watchers, she calls it a 'gin-and-it' and likes to have one before lunch).

Earlier on Wednesday she carried out a day of engagements in Scotland, re-opening the Borders Railway in front of cheering crowds.

At the railway station at Tweedbank she told the audience, ""Prince Philip and I are very grateful for the warmth of your welcome on this occasion. Many, including you first minister, have also kindly noted another significance attaching to today, although it is not one to which I have ever aspired.

""Inevitably a long life can pass by many milestones. My own is no exception. But I thank you all, and the many others at home and overseas for your touching messages of great kindness.""

Some in the bigger-than-usual crowd noted a little touch in her outfit: the diamond Bow Brooch, part of a set made for Victoria.

There was a touch of celebration down in London, where Tower Bridge lifted to let through the royal barge Gloriana in a flotilla down the Thames in the Queen's honour.

At St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle prayers marked the historic day, and special photo exhibitions of her reign were opened at Buckingham Palace, Edinburgh's Palace of Holyroodhouse and Windsor Castle.

David Cameron led MPs in paying tribute at Westminster, saying her reign was a ""golden thread running through three post-war generations"".

""Her selfless sense of service and duty have earned her unparalleled respect and admiration not only in Britain but around the world,"" he said.

However, the Queen was clearly determined to make as little of the occasion as possible – partly, some have speculated, because she would much rather her father had lived a long life, rather than died young giving her a chance at Victoria's record.

6d27bfae-1bab-4c8b-950c-74981a9ba00b,"The likelihood of Australia's two-Test series against Bangladesh getting underway - in Bangladesh, at least - appeared remote after Islamic State claimed responsibility for the slaying of an Italian aid worker in that nation's capital on Wednesday. The likelihood of Australia's two-Test series against Bangladesh getting underway - in Bangladesh, at least - appeared remote after the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the slaying of an Italian aid worker in Dhaka on Wednesday.

The death occurred as some members of Steve Smith's Test squad have said they don't want to tour Bangladesh, a nation that has struggled with a series of attacks on bloggers who've been critical of religious extremism.

Aid worker Cesare Tavella was ambushed by three men who fired at least three shots at him as he jogged through the city's diplomatic quarter.

His death follows Cricket Australia's decision on Saturday to delay the tour after receiving advice from ASIO and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding concerns for Australian ""interests"" in Bangladesh.

CA's three-man delegation returned from their fact-finding mission on Tuesday night. They are reporting to the CA board and it was expected the earliest a decision would be made was on Thursday.

The team is split over the fate of the tour. Some players are keen to go, others are worried.

One option that could be put to Bangladesh is they follow Pakistan's lead and play the games in Dubai, although the Bangladeshis could fear that would condemn them to forgoing international cricket in their nation, as happened to Pakistan.

Pakistan became a no-go zone for international teams after terrorists attacked the Sri Lankan squad, coached by Australian Trevor Bayliss, in 2009. Five policeman were killed and seven cricketers injured in Lahore when terrorists opened fire on the team bus.

While CA chief executive James Sutherland and his Bangladesh Cricket Board counterpart Nizam Uddin Chowdhury were in contact on Wednesday, former Australian Test cricketer Gavin Robertson said while CA had handled the situation intelligently it would be a big call to send the team after the aid worker's death.

""If DFAT say this is a worry and then you find the people who you're talking about make a claim they've killed somebody, how do you send them?"" said Robertson.

""How do you as a member of the board and knowing what happened to Trevor Bayliss [and the Sri Lankans], and aware of what DFAT have said, make the decision to go?""

Hours before Tavella's execution the British government advised its officials in Bangladesh ""to limit attendance at events where Westerners may gather"".

After the shooting, the US embassy in Dhaka ordered its employees to ""shelter in place"" and to avoid ""large gatherings in Bangladesh"". The American International School in Dhaka was closed while security was tightened in the diplomatic quarter.

On Wednesday Australia's 15-man squad was told to re-join their state squads. It's expected the likes of Smith, Mitchell Starc and Glenn Maxwell will re-enforce the Matador Cup one-day competition that starts for NSW on Monday when they play a CA XI, made up of the game's ""best of the rest"" young players, at Bankstown Oval.

It's an exclusive group of former prime ministers who can empathise with how Tony Abbott must be feeling the morning after the night before. But both Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, themselves ousted from the leadership following bitter internal party division in recent years, have publicly congratulated Australia's incoming prime minister Malcolm Turnbull following his dramatic ascension to power on Monday night.

Mr Rudd, who is currently in Europe after speaking at a weekend conference in Switzerland, took to Twitter in the early hours of Tuesday morning to offer his ""best wishes"" to the man who is set to become Australia's 29th prime minister. 

Best wishes to Malcolm Turnbull becoming Australia's 29th Prime Minister Huge job with huge challenges.Therese and I wish he and Lucy well.— Kevin Rudd (@MrKRudd) September 14, 2015

The comparison between Mr Rudd and Mr Turnbull has already been drawn by some within Mr Turnbull's own party.

In an extraordinary spray on national television on Monday afternoon, former Victorian Liberal premier Jeff Kennett suggested the pair shared the trait of ""extreme egotism"".

""This act by Malcolm Turnbull is one of gross disloyalty, extreme egotism and he is, without a doubt, the Kevin Rudd of the Liberal Party,"" he told ABC News 24.

""He might be smart, he might be wealthy but the one thing he never has been and never will be, he's never been a team man and teams win, individuals don't.""

Ms Gillard, who was toppled in a leadership spill in June 2013, also tweeted her congratulations to Mr Turnbull late on Monday night. 

Congratulations to Malcolm Turnbull on becoming Prime Minister - a great honour and responsibility. JG— Julia Gillard (@JuliaGillard) September 14, 2015

Perhaps one of the most bizarre social media responses came from eccentric billionaire MP Clive Palmer, who recorded a farewell video for Mr Abbott as he travelled in the back seat of a vehicle on Monday night.

He sent the video, which was similar to previous clips he had made for politicians Bronwyn Bishop and Campbell Newman, to media outlets and other politicians, after a single tweet saying simply: #Twidleytoo

""Goodbye Tony, goodbye. Goodbye Tony .. Tony time to go. Goodbye. Roll over, Malcolm's hopping into bed,"" "" Mr Palmer says in the video.

cefcc3b6-8cf8-497a-9517-8b239651af32,"Priscilla and Maria Ivette Chavez, twin sisters from Thornton, Colo., have faced numerous challenges together in their lives. Growing up with a single mom who had been diagnosed with cancer, the sisters helped take care of their younger siblings while attending school and preparing for graduation. Now, after being awarded the prestigious Daniels Fund Scholarship, the sisters are taking on life’s next challenge together: college at the University of Denver. 
 
The Denver-based Daniels Fund awards scholarships to high school seniors who have demonstrated exceptional engagement in their community, in academics and in leadership roles. Priscilla and Maria are among 232 students selected as Daniels Scholars this year. They have decided to attend DU’s Daniels College of Business , named, coincidentally, after the fund’s founder, cable TV pioneer Bill Daniels. 
 
The sisters say they never expected that both of them would receive the scholarship. 
 
“We went in thinking that only one of us was going to get it,” Maria says. “So when we applied, we said, ‘We should apply to other scholarships just to be prepared in case one of us doesn’t get it.’ When both of us got it, we were super excited.” 
 
Priscilla and Maria graduated this spring from Mapleton Early College, a Thornton high school designed to prepare students for college. At Mapleton, they were encouraged to volunteer and participate in extracurricular activities and community events. 
 
While pursuing the Daniels Fund scholarship, the sisters received guidance from advisors, Mapleton alumni and previous Daniels Scholars. But it was their mother who served as their biggest motivator. 
 
“Our mom only went to school until sixth grade, so she’s not the person you can go to for help with your math homework. But when she sees us struggling, she’s always the source of our motivation,” Priscilla says. “Even though she can’t help us, she believes in us firmly to let us know that we can do it. And any time anything’s going wrong, she’s there for us to cry to and to express ourselves to. You could say she’s one of our best friends.” 
 
The twins say they feel honored to have been chosen for the scholarship. 
 
“The values that Bill Daniels had are extraordinary, and we lived up to them before, because that’s what led us to this, but now we have to embody them even more and keep the reputation of the Daniels Fund alive,” Priscilla says.

Like most avid golfers, Nicole Criscone has a lifelong dream of visiting Augusta National, home of the Masters tournament. 

That her life has spanned less than 10 years isn't significant. 

""It's like the Disneyland for golfers,"" said Criscone, a Clifton Park resident who will be on golf's hallowed grounds in April, the Sunday before the Masters. 

Criscone, who won't turn 10 until March 22, is one of 80 youngsters who qualified for the national Drive, Chip and Putt contest to be held in Augusta, Ga. 

She advanced through local, state and regional qualifiers to earn her Augusta ticket. She started at Van Patten in Clifton Park, then moved on to the Turning Stone Resort , and had the final competition Sunday at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., site of the 1999 Ryder Cup. 

""That's what makes my job incredible,"" said Saratoga National golf pro Anders Mattson , who has been working with Criscone the past 17 months. ""The hard work that she puts in, and to see it pay off is just awesome."" 

She made it to the regionals last year but fell just short of earning a spot in the finals. 

""She was heartbroken,"" said her father, Craig. ""She came up four points short, so she vowed for this year to practice harder and come back, and she did."" 

The competition starts with three drives on a 40-yard-wide grid. Golfers then execute a 15-yard chip, with points awarded based on how close it rests to the pin. It finishes with putts of 6, 15 and 30 feet. 

Putting was her downfall last year, so Criscone worked on that this time. 

""This year we worked really hard on her 30-footers, from all kinds of breaks and speed, and Anders also worked with her,"" Craig Criscone said. ""She put it less than two inches away from the hole this year for her 30-footer, which won it for her."" 

Nicole has been golfing more than half her life 

""One day my dad took me to the range because my mom (Tammy) was at work,"" she said. ""I watched him hit a couple, and I asked him if I could drive. I was only 4 or 5. He said sure. I rented clubs, and a couple of days later he got me my own set and got me a coach and we went on from there."" 

Criscone's success isn't limited to specialty-skills events. She won her age group the past two years on the Northeastern New York PGA's Junior Golf Tour, winning every tournament this summer. 

""I love hitting the ball,"" she said. ""I love winning. Second of all, I like that it's quiet because all of the other sports, everybody's screaming. 'Yay!' It's a sport you can take your time on and you don't need to rush."" 

Former LPGA star and Saratoga Springs resident Dottie Pepper called Mattson about giving Criscone lessons. 

""When Dottie calls you, there might be something to it,"" Mattson said. ""I was certainly intrigued as soon as she called me. ... It's golf, and it's highly rewarding to watch somebody else succeed, certainly more rewarding than watching myself succeed. She's a lot of fun, has a lot of energy, and I'm excited for her. 

""I can't wait to go down to Augusta and watch her down there and watch the rest of her career, because it certainly has a lot of potential.""",9-year-old from Clifton Park earns ticket to Augusta National,News,Times Union,2015-09-17T06:06:11Z

When: Premieres 9 p.m. Sunday through Nov. 22. 

Where: PBS SoCal. 
    
Despite its innocuous title, “Indian Summers” develops some real heat as a political thriller. 

Be warned, though, the nine-part series, which begins airing tonight on PBS “Masterpiece,” unfolds slowly. 

Set during the last days of the British Raj — the same period covered in the beloved 1980s miniseries “The Jewel in the Crown” — “Indian Summers” boasts a large cast, and it does takes awhile to get them into place. 

The place is the Himalayan hill town of Shimla, where the British civil servants who run India in 1932 can retreat for a holiday in a cooler climate. While the country is chafing under English rule, ex-pats at the social club run by Cynthia Coffin (Julie Walters) can feel like royalty. Membership is strictly white (“no Indians or dogs”), the locals are servants. 
  
The well-coiffed racist matriarch is also a facilitator, making sure everything is taken care of for a young, ambitious diplomat Ralph Whelan (Henry Lloyd-Hughes), who may rise to become viceroy of India, and his sister, Alice (Jemima Whelan). 

Also staying at the club are the viceroy himself, Lord Willingdon (Patrick Malahide), an American brother and sister (Edward Hogg and Olivia Grant), and an Englishman (Alexander Cobb) visiting his alcoholic uncle (Richard McCabe). 

There is also a missionary (Craig Parkinson), who runs a school for abandoned half-caste children. His wife (Fiona Glascott) is terribly unhappy and jealous of the school’s teacher, (Amber Rose Revah), who is a half-caste. 
  
As the Brits are smugly ensconced in their club, India’s Congress party led by Mahatma Gandhi is pushing for independence. Rather than an upstairs-downstairs dynamic of “Downton Abbey,” “Indian Summers” tells its story from the perspective of both the English and Indian characters. 

One is Whelan’s man Aafrin (Nikesh Patel). His sister, Sooni (Aysha Kala), is angry at him for working for the British. All he wants is to marry Sita (Ellora Torchia), but he must keep her secret because they are of different sects. 
  
“Indian Summers” soon enough reveals some nasty secret goings-on meant to undermine the Congress Party. Then murders jack up the stakes. 

Created by Paul Rutman, the sumptuous-looking series lures us in with sex, the exotic and mystery to explore themes of racism and injustice. Be patient, “Masterpiece” fans, you will find “Indian Summers” an entertainingly good time.

	Jennings said; “I look forward to continuing the excellent work of my predecessor Hugo Wynn-Williams in providing a robust and cost-effective reinsurance programme for the international shipping industry.

4be4e1c6-b2ee-41d0-847e-52430d2ef4bd,"A former Navy SEAL who was severely injured in a failed attempt to rescue Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl says the former Taliban captive now accused of desertion deserves punishment for endangering the lives of those who tried to save him. 
 
“The guy should be held accountable. He left, he risked lives and he pulled assets from other parts of the war,” said retired Senior Chief Petty Officer Jimmy Hatch, who added he knew someone would get “killed or hurt” as a result of Bergdahl’s decision to leave his unit. 
 
“Sure enough, days later I was shot, lying in a field screaming my head off,” said Hatch, whose femur was shattered, the bone blasted out of the back of his right leg by an AK-47 round in the effort to rescue Bergdahl from the Taliban. 
 
Hatch spoke to the Herald yesterday as Bergdahl’s commanding officer testified at Fort Sam Houston in Texas that his unit searched for the missing sergeant for weeks. Bergdahl — who disappeared from his post in 2009 in Afghanistan and was held by the Taliban for five years — is facing a military tribunal to determine whether he should undergo a court-martial on charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. He could face a maximum penalty of life in prison. 
 
Hatch, a 48-year-old Bronze Star recipient, said he’s speaking out now because the Bergdahl hearing needs more media attention. 
  
Similar news 
    
The latest on Bergdahl hearing: Hearing begins to see if Bergdahl should face court-martial 
   
“I think it’s telling that this hearing isn’t a blip on the radar of today’s news,” he said. “It’s all about Donald Trump and the political circus.” 
 
“My injuries, I took a bullet — people had to risk their lives to come and save me. A helicopter had to fly back into a very active gunfight,” said Hatch, who suffered debilitating depression because he felt he failed the mission. “I struggled hard after I got hurt.” 
 
Bergdahl’s defense attorneys plan to argue that their client has already suffered enough in his lengthy captivity. 
 
But Hatch said Bergdahl shouldn’t get a pass because his careless actions placed numerous American lives in harm’s way. 
 
“What’s amazing isn’t that Bergdahl walked off, it’s amazing that we went out to rescue him. ... I want, as a person who paid a bit of a price for his decision, I want him to be held accountable,” said Hatch, who underwent 18 surgeries on his leg and still walks with a limp. 
 
“Hostage rescue missions are very, very difficult and Mr. Bergdahl’s decision created a situation where a lot of Americans had to risk their lives,” he said. 
 
While rescuing Bergdahl, Hatch said he didn’t think of him as a deserter, just as a comrade in arms who needed to be saved. 
 
“He’s an American, and he’s got a mom, he’s got people who are close to him,” Hatch recalled. “I just didn’t want his mom to see his head chopped off on YouTube.” 
 
Hatch suspects that the “bad guys” who captured Bergdahl were prepared for the two-helicopter rescue mission — citing the high number of men and force of firepower Hatch faced. 
 
“We were very, very fortunate that a whole lot of Americans weren’t killed. I think that the people who had him captive were probably thinking that someone was going to get him,” Hatch recalled. 
 
“This wasn’t a typical two or three guys with AK-47s. There were crew-serviced machine guns and suicide grenades. They weren’t your average Taliban guys, and there were a lot of them” said Hatch. 
 
The bottom line for Hatch is that Bergdahl should face a court-martial. 
 
“The military will do the right thing,” he said. “I have faith that they are going to examine everything. I want him to be accountable.”

b5df7bb1-4969-41ff-9b02-c1096606ee91,"SANTA CLARA, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/25/15 --  Jasper, a global Internet of Things (IoT) platform leader, hosted a panel of industry leaders from AT&T, ChargePoint, GM and LoJack for a discussion on IoT's role in the acceleration of Connected Car innovation across the ecosystem. The group, which gathered yesterday in downtown San Francisco, shared insights on the state of the Connected Car industry and how IoT is enabling companies across industries to create an ecosystem of high value, revenue-generating services around the connected vehicle. 

""Over a decade ago, the auto industry was one of the first to recognize that a manufacturer's relationship with their customer doesn't have to end with a product sale. Introducing safety and security services enabled them to stay connected with customers long after they drove off the dealer's lot,"" said Macario Namie, Jasper's Vice President of Strategy. "" Since then, with the widespread growth of IoT, Connected Car business models have undergone a significant transformation. The car has become a hub that enables the delivery of a host of new, dynamic services -- from in-vehicle Wi-Fi to the location of electric vehicle charging stations to stolen vehicle recovery -- throughout the car's lifetime. Last night's panel pulled back the curtain on the scope and scale of these initiatives as well as how players from multiple industries are collaborating to make the promise of the Connected Car a reality for customers worldwide."" 

The discussion, moderated by Namie, included a distinguished group of panelists: 

Panelists shared the lessons they learned from successfully deploying IoT services that fulfill customer needs and enhance the driving experience. As leading innovators in the Connected Car ecosystem, they examined critical hurdles facing the industry, such as identifying the killer app to drive mass consumer adoption of connected vehicles, and offered predictions on the trajectory of Connected Car innovation. 

Primary takeaways from the conversation included:

476471f7-d50e-499d-ba8e-ecc35692ce4e,"A crash that killed four people and injured dozens in Seattle on Thursday may have been caused by a mechanical issue on one of Seattle’s Ride the Ducks amphibious tour vehicles, police said. 

The amphibious vehicle, known as a duck, was headed north on the Aurora bridge around 11:15 a.m. when it collided with a charter bus that was going south, according to the Seattle Police Department. Two passenger vehicles were also involved in the crash. 

Witnesses told investigators that the duck vehicle may have been dealing with a mechanical issue shortly before the crash, according to a Seattle Police Department news release . 

Four people were killed in the wreck, Seattle Fire Chief Harold Scoggins said in a news briefing. 

“We’ve had a terrible tragedy,"" Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said during the briefing. ""There’s been a terrible loss of life.” 

Scenes broadcast by local media showed the crumpled front end of the white duck vehicle against the side of the charter bus. Shattered glass, metal siding and a tire littered the roadway, and the side of the bus appeared to have been sheared off in the collision. 

Officials did not immediately identify the dead. It remains unclear which vehicle was at fault in the crash, but police officials said there was no evidence that drivers were intoxicated or otherwise impaired. 
 
Approximately 45 students and staff members from North Seattle College's international program were aboard the bus, according to the college . They were traveling to Safeco Field as part of a student orientation program. 

It was not clear whether any of the students were among the dead or injured. Murray said his staff was in the process of contacting their countries' consulates. 

Earlier in the day, Fire Lt. Sue Stengl told reporters that two of those killed were aboard the Ride the Ducks vehicle. 

At least 50 people were extricated from the damaged vehicles and evaluated for injuries, Stengl said. 

Seventeen people were taken to Harborview Medical Center, the hospital said shortly before 3 p.m. Eight of those patients were in critical condition, eight were in serious condition, and one remained in satisfactory condition, the hospital said. 

The injured suffered face and head injuries, according to the hospital. 

Three of those patients were in surgery, it said. 

The youngest patient was a 17-year-old girl, and the oldest a 61-year-old man, the hospital said. 

Thirty other people were taken to area hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, according to Harborview. 

The Aurora Bridge, which spans Lake Union and connects the city's Queen Anne and Fremont neighborhoods, is to be closed for several hours. 

Treating injuries from the crash severely taxed the local blood supply, according to Bloodworks Northwest, which put out an emergency call for donors after receiving numerous requests for blood components from local hospitals. 
  
According to Ride the Ducks' website , the company has been operating its DUKW vehicles, nicknamed ducks, since 1997. The vehicles can traverse both land and water, and they came to prominence during World War II, when they were used to move items from offshore supply ships to military units on land. 

The company has not been the subject of any unsafe driving or vehicle maintenance violations in the last two years, according to data made public by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. 
 
However, it has been involved in several accidents in the city, according to the Seattle Times . A pedestrian was struck by a Ride the Ducks vehicle in July, and the company was also involved in crashes in 2010 and 2011, the newspaper reported. 

One of the company's vehicles was also involved in a crash last February, according to the safety administration database. Two people were injured, and police issued a citation to the bus driver. Additional information was not available. 

Ride the Ducks has a fleet of 28 vehicles and 35 drivers, according to the safety administration. The company’s website says all of its drivers are required to hold both a U.S. Coast Guard master's license and a commercial driver's license. 

A Ride the Ducks spokeswoman said the company would release a statement later in the day.

f90e1177-0083-4b84-8423-195afecb04f6,"Angus Young stood defiantly onstage, wearing the schoolboy outfit that he's sported for decades and striking his signature pose, with one hand holding the guitar, the other reaching for the sky. 
  
Forty-four thousand fans erupted in approval, knowing that the mere first sight of the legendary ax man assured one thing: AC/DC would rock AT&T Park in San Francisco on Friday. 
  
And that it did, delivering a two-hour show packed with hard rock classics. The Australian band also performed solid versions of newer songs, most of them from its 17th studio album, ""Rock or Bust,"" which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 in December. 
  
It was an amazing effort for a band that has gone through many significant changes during its 40-plus-year career. The biggest change was in lead singers, when the great Bon Scott died in 1980 and Brian Johnson quickly took over the microphone. Then there was last year's retirement of Malcolm Young, who was diagnosed with dementia. 
 
 
  
The only constant throughout the years has been Angus Young, and he continues to be enough. 
  
Following an opening set by the L.A.-based R&B-rock act Vintage Trouble, AC/DC kicked off the main event with an adrenaline-rich version of the new album. Then the group moved into a stellar ""Shoot to Thrill,"" the best track on 1980's phenomenally popular ""Back in Black."" 
  
Young -- and vocalist Johnson, bassist Cliff Williams, guitarist Stevie Young and drummer Chris Slade -- just kept the peddle to the metal, mixing new songs, like the single ""Play Ball,"" with old favorites such as the title track to 1976's ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap."" 
  
Johnson's vocals aren't as sharp as they once were, but he still can convey a range of emotions with his lines. He remains a very powerful and moving frontman. Of course, being a frontman in AC/DC means taking a back seat to Young. 
  
The 60-year-old guitarist was the dominant force as the group continued with a booming ""Thunderstruck,"" from 1990's ""The Razor's Edge,"" and then an electrifying ""High Voltage,"" the title track from the band's stellar 1976 international debut. The rest of the group was right on target, giving the master a sturdy musical canvas on which to paint. 
  
A little beyond the halfway point in the show, AC/DC forgot about the new stuff to concentrate on the classics, hammering through ""Sin City, ""Shot Down in Flames,"" ""T.N.T.,"" ""Whole Lotta Rosie"" and other longtime favorites. 
  
The crowd was multigenerational, with grade school-age kids, great grandparents and everyone in between singing along to ""Hells Bells,"" with gusto. This band continues to hold onto its longtime fans while attracting new ones. 
  
The show featured a really cool stage design, as well as great lighting, special effects and props, such as a giant inflatable ""Rosie."" Of course, big cannons were fired during the encore of ""For Those About to Rock (We Salute You),"" and fireworks followed. (The cannons seemed a bit muffled this time, compared to past tours -- probably a good thing for the neighbors.) 
  
AC/DC brought the show to a triumphant close gems such as ""T.N.T.,"" ""Highway to Hell"" and ""Let There Be Rock,"" which featured a lengthy spotlight on Young's guitar heroics. 
  
In all, it was a great night for one of rock's great legendary acts.

7fd6c462-e5fd-461b-ba9b-097cff0787b9,"Talented European stayer Arod, third favourite for this year's Group One Cox Plate at Moonee Valley, could be in doubt following a positive weather pattern for next Sunday's rich Arc de Triomphe meeting in France. 

Talented European galloper Arod, the third favourite in early betting for this year's Cox Plate at Moonee Valley, could be in doubt following a positive weather pattern for next Sunday's rich Arc de Triomphe meeting.

Arod, owned by one of Europe's most influential owners, Sheikh Fahad, went into quarantine last week in preparation for a tilt at this year's group 1 Cox Plate, a race for which he was immediately anointed as the third favourite and the most popular import.

However Sheikh Fahad and his two brothers who control Qatar Racing, one of the world's most powerful racing operations, have until Wednesday to decide whether the four-year-old goes to France or remains in quarantine and heads to Australia's most important weight-for-age event, to be held on October 24.

The sticking point is that Arod relishes firm ground and the long-term forecast for France this Sunday is fine and mild, which has led to the debate on the horse's next start.

Arod, a winner of four races from 10 starts and who is trained by Peter Chapple-Hyam, would be unable to compete in the Cox Plate if he comes out of quarantine for his French engagement.

Apart from Fawkner, the Australian line-up for weight-for-age contenders for this year's Cox Plate is far from strong.

And Sheikh Fahad could have another interest in the race if his group 2-winning mare Noble Protector can strike the form that took her to such heights during the autumn.

The imported mare, who is trained by Robert Smerdon at Caulfield, worked strongly on Monday at Moonee Valley over 1200m, finishing her work powerfully.

Noble Protector, always a long-range Cox Plate hopeful, will either start in Friday night's Stocks Stakes at Moonee Valley or be reserved for the group 1 Toorak Handicap on Saturday week.

Smerdon said that he would weigh up which race would best suit the mare in the coming days.

""She was disappointing at Flemington, there's no escaping that, things didn't go right for her as the race panned out,"" he said of Noble Protector, who resumed from a spell when finishing 13th in the Let's Elope Stakes on September 12.

""She had a good break between runs and I can't fault her work since. I was happy with what she did on Monday morning. It's now a matter of weighing up what race best suits her.

""She's a group 2, 3 and a listed winner. We just hope things will be back on track for the next time she goes round.""

And, his one-time Blue Diamond Stakes and Golden Slipper favourite, Fontiton makes her spring return against a field of open-age sprinters in the $450,000 Moir Stakes on Friday night.

Last autumn Fontiton showed blistering speed to be promoted as Victoria's finest two-year-old with three straight wins, however luck was against her on the most important day when she finished fifth in the group 1 Blue Diamond Stakes.

""She looks well, she's had two jump-outs and has looked bright and alert. On the other hand, the Moir Stakes won't be an easy assignment,"" he said.

""But she's very fit and she has great natural speed. She has 51 kilos but, as you would expect for a group 1 race, there's loads of depth and talent in quite a few of her own age looking to start so it won't be easy.""

Craig Williams will take the ride on Fontiton. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",Spring racing carnival: Major Cox Plate hope Arod in doubt,News,Liverpool Champion,2015-09-28T09:14:41Z
274dbddd-ed83-4cc7-ba5f-d451aaa7a072,"Prepare to be transported to a village known as the “Kingdom of Girls”  
Sep 23, 2015 
    
""Ibapyntngen with lipstick"" portrays the air of adultness many of the Khasi girls exude 
 
There’s something different about the girls of Mawlynnong. In this tiny village of 500 inhabitants tucked away in the jungles of northeast India, women rule. Mawlynnong is home to the indigenous Khasi tribe - one of the few matriarchal and matrilineal societies on earth. Here, women inherit land, children take their mother’s surname, and men marry into their wives’ family homes. In her series,  Mädchenland , which translates to “Kingdom of Girls,” German photographer  Karolin Klüppel seeks to capture “ the outstanding role of the females ” in Mawlynnong. 

 
 Khasi girls embody an air of self-confidence that's visible in their portraits  
 
 Klüppel sought to capture the Khasi girls in their everyday environment  
 
Klüppel’s arresting portraits are not intended to be a statement on the girls’ social, familial or societal context. Rather, by capturing the Khasi girls in their everyday physical environments,  Kluppel portrays their “ strong self-awareness and pronounced air of self-sufficiency .” 
 
In an interview for Fotografia , Klüppel notes how women’s special standing and exceptional role in this society produces a great self-confidence in the girls. She adds “I was so impressed by their self-assured appearance, and thought that this must be how matrilineality becomes visible.” 
 
 Wanda stands at the stairs of a treehouse in the village where girls rule 
 
There’s no doubt, Khasi girls are different. In a society where women are revered and respected, self-confidence flourishes, self-sufficiency blooms, and maturity thrives. And here’s the photographic evidence to prove it.

5018bae1-ea2d-4c7f-a13f-87ab6c257840,"Ms. Barra, meeting this week with top managers at a test facility near GM's headquarters, said the nation's largest auto maker emerged from recent trials with a fresh eye on improving its performance in certain markets and countries rather than trying to be all things to all people. GM for decades aimed to be the most ubiquitous auto company in the world, leveraging a large stable of brands and manufacturing operations across the globe. 
 

     GM recently pulled out of manufacturing operations in Southeast Asia and is planning to shutter a factory in Australia. In Russia, meanwhile, the company responded to regulatory requirements and economic pressure by ending most of its sales and manufacturing operations there. 
 

     ""We've got to decide where we can make a sustainable return, where we should deploy the capital,"" Ms. Barra said during an interview. When setting goals, she said it is very important ""do it in terms of margins, not market share."" 
 

     The comments come as Volkswagen AG, one of GM's biggest rivals, is 
 

     engulfed in a scandal related to emissions software. The crisis has cost the German company's Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn his job, and threatens to require billions of dollars of capital to resolve. 
 

     Ms. Barra declined to comment specifically on Volkswagen's emissions-testing scandal. Unlike GM's recent strategy, Volkswagen had been pursuing ambitious sales goals and sought to wrestle the top spot in annual sales volume from Toyota Motor Corp. 
 

     GM's chief executive spent much of her first year in office overseeing one of the U.S. auto industry's biggest scandals--faulty ignition switches that led to millions of vehicle recalls and dozens of deaths and injuries. Last week, GM agreed to pay $900 million to settle a criminal charges levied by the Justice Department. That settlement, she said, serves as a bookend to the ignition-switch crisis. 
 

     That settlement also proves the company has made progress, she said. By cooperating with the government and regulators, GM was able to settle the matter with the Justice Department relatively quickly and is now moving past what is likely to be the costliest part of the crisis. 
 

     Still, Ms. Barra faces plenty of other challenges ahead, including recent attempts by rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne to force the company into discussions on a merger. 
 

     She said her management team and board--working with external experts--""thoroughly reviewed"" Mr. Marchionne's proposal, but the group believes GM is better suited to achieving its goals operating on its own. 
 

     ""We have scale and there comes a point where more scale becomes a diminishing return,"" she said. Again referring to past decisions to chase volume over profit, she said focusing on the current strategy ""is in the best interest of our shareholders versus doubling down on the past."" 
 

     Still, some Wall Street analysts have said GM shares appear to have little upside, and they have instead been bullish on automotive startups, such as Silicon Valley's Tesla Motors Inc., which makes pricey electric cars, and ride-sharing company Uber Technologies Inc. Both have valuations near GM's $47 billion market cap, but have only a fraction of the revenue and fixed costs. 
 

     Mr. Barra says she has been able to keep the Detroit-based company focused on growth objectives and on meeting the challenge of rapidly changing automotive technology by practicing ""ambidextrous"" leadership. 
 

     She said the company had a dedicated team of executives working on the ignition switch situation, so the rest of the company could focus on its plan for future products that are powered by batteries or can run via autonomous-vehicle technology. 
 

     Ms. Barra said she views its prime potential growth markets as including India, China, and the U.S. luxury car business. In recent years, GM has benefited from a sharp increase in U.S. demand for trucks and sport-utility vehicles, which is helping fund future projects, such as ride-sharing applications or autonomous-driving vehicle technology. 
 

     In addition, she said the company has grown nimbler since its bankruptcy, able to respond rapidly to market changes. For example, in China executives have implemented three ""efficiency up, cost down"" plans since the beginning of the year to respond to economic softening as Ms. Barra demands the region hit the promised results despite market conditions. 
 

     Ms. Barra said the company needs to deliver on what it promises if it hopes to get Wall Street to give it more credit. GM's stock price hasn't grown during her tenure, closing at $29.44 on Thursday, below the company's $33 initial public offering price in 2010. 
 

     She also said GM needs to prove it can perform well during a downturn, delivering consistent results from the ""peak to trough"" of an economic cycle.

c451cf6f-04ba-42b8-a5b0-5b9e26dec5fd,"The band said that the show was meant to tease the rival University of Kansas by depicting the other team's mascot, the Jayhawk, being struck by the starship Enterprise from the ""Star Trek"" science fiction franchise. 

NEW YORK: A US marching band has landed in unexpectedly hot territory after social media users spotted a giant phallic shape in its halftime show. 

Kansas State University on Tuesday apologized and announced a self-imposed $5,000 fine over the performance during its American football team’s season opener on Saturday. 

The band said that the show was meant to tease the rival University of Kansas by depicting the other team’s mascot, the Jayhawk, being struck by the starship Enterprise from the “Star Trek” science fiction franchise. 

But Twitter and Facebook users quickly posted pictures of the formation, charging that the supposed spacecraft looked more like the male anatomy. 

“It is unfortunate that the band has been criticized on social media for a portion of the show which was taken completely out of context,” university president Kirk Schulz said in a letter to band members released Tuesday. 

“As many of you know, I love social media; however, it is also an opportunity for people to post hurtful and uninformed comments,” he said. 

He said that the university decided on the fine, to be paid to the Big 12 Conference of university sports, for violating sportsmanship guidelines by attacking another team. 

Kansas State beat the University of South Dakota 34-0 in Saturday’s game, but will not play rival University of Kansas until November 28. 

Kansas State band director Frank Tracz will serve a one-game suspension during that game, and the university said it would approve all future band halftime shows — a popular part of college American football games — in advance. 

Tracz said he had received thousands of supportive emails but also some threats and therefore he understood the need to avoid the University of Kansas game. 

“Some fanatics on a website and the electronic world… take this to the edge and to a new level that causes problems,” he told KMAN, a radio station in his university’s hometown of Manhattan, Kansas. 

The game will be played at the University of Kansas, 85 miles away (135 kilometers) away in Lawrence.",US marching band rapped after ‘phallic’ halftime show,News,Free Malaysia Today,2015-09-09T00:05:33Z

 Painting as a reference to painting; painting as a riposte to painting; painting as a critical reflection on the act of painting itself. Painting is an increasingly complex business these days. In an era in which the medium, on its own, is widely considered a kind of vestige, Rick Amor may well be something of an anachronism. But that's OK. Painting is what Amor does and has done for the best part of half a century. He creates studies with charcoal, then he paints them.

98b4a296-53e6-4bda-90e9-bf9052e135af,"Tamarack Resort announced Tuesday that it is reopening its Wildwood trail system for skiers and riders as “hike-to” terrain. 

This series of trails in the most northern section of the resort’s boundary includes 100 acres of long-time skier favorite slopes. Guests will now have the ability to ski the trails with a short hike in and out of the trail system. 

The Wildwood area originally closed in 2009 due to the removal of a lift in that section of the mountain. In October 2014, Tamarack came under the guidance of Replay Resorts, a resort operator who specializes in reinvigorating destination resort properties. The Replay Resorts’ team recognized the potential of the area, and is reopening the trails to the public. 

Guests will access this trail system by skiing to the top of a trail called Enigma, then taking a 5-minute hike to the top of Wildwood. From there, guests can ski approximately halfway down the trails before being directed back to the resort’s main trail system with a short hike. Guests can then ski back to the established lift network via the Waltz ski trail. 

“The Wildwood trails have been mostly untouched by skiers and riders for nearly six years. Reopening this terrain to guests willing to take the short hike and ‘earn their turns’ is a great way to create a new ski experience that is unique to Tamarack,” says Brad Larsen, General Manager of Tamarack Resort.

TRAVERSE CITY, Michigan — Michigan's U.S. senators are calling for a ban on shipments of crude oil by vessels on the Great Lakes. 
 
Sens. Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow introduced legislation Wednesday that would prohibit such shipments. They don't happen now, but Peters says the idea of using barges or tankers to move oil on the lakes has been raised. 
 
The bill also would require federal studies of risks posed by pipelines that run through the Great Lakes and other waterways in the region. The studies would consider alternatives to an oil pipeline beneath the Straits of Mackinac owned by Enbridge Energy Partners, which is conducting a spill response exercise with government agencies Thursday. 
 
Additional provisions in the measure would require improving spill response plans and giving the public more information about pipeline risks.",Senators want ban on vessel shipments of oil on Great Lakes,News,Greenfield Daily Reporter,2015-09-23T20:50:05Z

Other provisions include requiring written rental agreements and having a fire extinguisher and smoke detectors.

4b667542-e48d-431f-a4ae-4030265c448a,"The brains behind Fox's Minority Report  want you to know that you can still watch their show even if you never saw the film of the same name starring Tom Cruise. ""We tell you everything you need to know, and you'll enjoy the show without ever seeing the movie,"" executive producer Max Borenstein tells TVGuide.com . But when you see the movie, it fills in all this rich backstory... that is invaluable and really tells the story.""Indeed, the new Fox drama (premiering Monday at 9/8c) is a sequel to the film and, despite the exposition dump that explains how the two properties share a timeline and some characters, really has very little relation to the movie. Instead, in 2065, the PreCrime program that was at the center of the film has now been abolished and the three child pre-cogs, people who get visions of the future, that powered the program have since grown up in hiding. Fall Preview: Check out all the must-watch new shows However, when one of those kids, Dash ( Stark Sands ), can no longer tolerate standing aside and watching people die, he turns to a cop named Vega ( Meagan Good ) to try to use his fragmented visions to save lives. ""Vega provides that extra piece of the puzzle,"" Borenstein says. ""She has both the access that a police person will have, but also the sort of wit and the investigative ability and the tools to put pieces together. So, they make a kind of perfect complementary team."" But accomplishing their goals is anything but a perfect science. ""Vega is operating inside the lines and so they're doing [this] in the margins,"" Borenstein says. ""That makes it a challenge. How do you prosecute? You can't go in there with an arrest warrant. You have to figure out creative ways to stop crimes, which makes the show really fresh because we don't start with a dead body. We start with a vision of a dead body. So you have this great ticking clock which is built in the show."" In many ways, the show seems more like a sibling to Person of Interest than the child of a Spielberg movie. Like the CBS procedural, Minority Report is ultimately an exercise in vigilantes racing against the clock to save lives. And just like Person of Interest, the heroes won't always see eye to eye on how to use their special skills. Everything You Need to Know About Minority Report ""They're going to be partners, but there's always an unease about it,"" Borenstein says. ""It's this very, very uneasy alliance. Their perspectives on the world are totally different. She wants to catch the bad guys. He wants to save lives. Well, sometimes in order to catch the bad guy you may need to wait to catch them in the act, which means you're putting lives at risk. So, that argument is going to always be there. No matter how close they get, that argument is at the center of the show."" Complicating matters is Dash's strained relationships with his siblings and fellow pre-cogs, foster sister Agatha ( Laura Regan ) and twin Arthur ( Nick Zano ). While Agatha repeatedly warns Dash that his abilities will once again be exploited if he shares them with the world, Arthur takes a much more cynical approach. ""Arthur knows that the only thing these people have in their lives is their visions,"" Borenstein says. ""That's their gift. It's a curse, but that's their gift. He knows that the only thing that will keep them from being exploited ... is leveraging that gift for their own power. So, he is not evil; he has a vision of society that's a lot more realistic frankly."" However, it's the contrast between the two twins that perhaps suggests the true heroism the show hopes to explore. ""The superhero archetype is that someone is gifted with a power that allows them to act,"" Borenstein says. ""In this case, [Dash's] power is only to know, and he actually is limited because he doesn't have that social understanding and he hasn't had a healthy, normal life. So the fact that he acts makes him that much more heroic. Exclusive First Look: How Minority Report is ""picking up the pieces"" after the movie ""He's seen murders every day all of his life,"" Borenstein continues. ""You would think that he would have a cynical outlook towards the world. You would think that he would say because society imprisoned him for all those years, society be damned. The fact that he doesn't speaks to this part of his character that's heroic and fundamentally optimistic about people."" But could that heroism have a dark side? ""If by enslaving three people who could see the future you could prevent every murder in the city, how many people do you think would immediately vote to enslave those three people?"" Borenstein says. ""Morality and ethics would go out the door, and maybe that's the right decision. It's very difficult to say, and we want to lean into that. There is no black and white there."" And if it meant saving the world, would Dash ever willingly let himself once again be put into the milk bath? "" When that moment comes to pass, you can bet that's going to be a question he would ask,"" Borenstein says. Minority Report premieres Monday at 9/8c on Fox.

49934f7c-854c-4c26-a94c-c6d32bda44fd,"WASHINGTON , Sept. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The organic opportunity has never been greater.  But realizing that opportunity will not be easy. A group of organic thought leaders looked into the future on Thursday and agreed that major challenges need to be overcome for organic to fulfill its potential and move significantly beyond its position of nearly five percent of the U.S. food supply.   

""The next three to five years are going to be mission-critical for what happens in organic 15 years from now,"" said Melissa Hughes , General Counsel of organic dairy cooperative Organic Valley and President of the Organic Trade Association (OTA) Board of Directors. ""We have to figure out how to meet the needs of organic farmers now so they will be able to meet the needs of the future."" 
   
Hughes was part of a panel discussion on the current and future state of organic which kicked off OTA's two-day All Things Organic educational conference program at the Natural Products Expo East show in Baltimore . Moderated by OTA Executive Director and CEO Laura Batcha , the panel also included Danielle Nierenberg , founder of Food Tank, and Lynn Clarkson , President of Clarkson Grain . 

The panel saw demand for organic products continuing to grow in the future. Several factors play into this scenario for continued strong organic demand: a growing awareness of the importance of eating healthy food, an increasing desire to know more about the source of our food and how it was produced, a generational shift in consumption and buying trends, and heightened concern about the environmental impacts of the practices of large-scale conventional and industrial agriculture. 

The U.S. organic sector has exploded in the past two decades. Sales of organic in the United States broke through another record in 2014, totaling $39.1 billion , up more than 11 percent from the previous year, according to OTA's latest survey on the industry. Organic demand now cuts across all regions, all ages, and all income groups. 

New information on the U.S. organic agricultural sector released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Thursday showed that sales of organic crops and livestock at the farm-gate level reached $5.5 billion in 2014, up 72 percent from 2008. In the third survey of U.S. organic agriculture since 2008, USDA also said the industry shows potential for growth, with some 39 percent of organic farmers surveyed reporting that they intend to increase production over the next five years. 

A resource-constrained environment 

The fact that a good portion of organic farmers intend to boost their production is welcome news for the sector. Panelists in Thursday's All Things Organic session said not having enough organic supplies to meet demand is the number one issue in the rapidly growing organic industry. 

""At the rate organic is growing, organic demand could double in six years,"" said panelist Clarkson, who is president of Illinois -based Clarkson Grain , an organic corn and soybean supplier. ""By 2030, organic could be 10 percent of the U.S. food supply, but how are we going to do that if we lack the raw organic materials? We need to have more organic production in the U.S."" 

Clarkson noted that despite higher prices for organic crops than for conventional, American farmers have still been slow to switch to organic. Because of that, the U.S. is importing organic soybeans and corn and other organic ingredients, and is ""turning over its best markets to foreign suppliers."" 

""So much of the organic sector is living in a resource-constrained environment now,"" said Hughes. Hughes called on the organic industry to begin building the foundation to enable a supply cushion that could fill future demand and also guard against crop losses caused by extreme weather events and climate change. 

Shift in organic buying habits 

OTA's Batcha and other panelists noted how patterns in organic buying have changed significantly over the years. Organic is no longer mainly bought at farmers' markets or specialty food stores, and traditional supermarkets and the big box stores are now huge players in the organic sector. 

""New organic buyers are flexible about where they buy organic,"" said Batcha. ""Millennials have no problem going to the farmers' market for organic produce in the morning, then driving to their favorite big box store later to pick up paper towels and, while they're there, buy some organic cereal."" 

Another change in food buying – and most pronounced in the organic sector – is buying food online, pointed out Nierenberg, who said, ""It will be exciting to see in the next 15 years how organic can reach more consumers, and how it can scale not just up but out."" 

The Organic Trade Association (OTA) is the membership-based business association for organic agriculture and products in North America . OTA is the leading voice for the organic trade in the United States , representing over 8,500 organic businesses across 50 states. Its members include growers, shippers, processors, certifiers, farmers' associations, distributors, importers, exporters, consultants, retailers and others. OTA's Board of Directors is democratically elected by its members. OTA's mission is to promote and protect ORGANIC with a unifying voice that serves and engages its diverse members from farm to marketplace.

    This story  
SANTA CLARITA, CA 
(Marketwired - September 29, 2015) - BioSolar, Inc. (OTCQB: BSRC), developer of breakthrough energy storage technology and materials, today commented on the potential for the Company's Super Cathode technology to benefit the booming utility-scale storage market by lowering cost and seamlessly integrating its patent pending cathode manufacturing process into existing Li-ion battery manufacturing processes. 

Utility power companies, often challenged in managing the grid during peak electricity demand, are now installing battery storage solutions as an alternative to adding expensive generation capacity. Battery storage offers several benefits over traditional power sources, such as being cleaner and responding faster, as well as possessing the flexibility to be located directly at load centers. Of perhaps greatest importance, battery storage solutions are becoming increasingly less expensive than other options for tackling peak electricity demand, further generating interest from utility providers. 

According to TriplePundit, while the residential energy storage market is still considered to be in its early stages in terms of adoption, the utility-scale market is booming. U.S. energy storage capacity grew by 40 percent from 2013 to 2014, with 90 percent of that new capacity deployed in front of the meter (i.e., utility-scale). The article also states that storage in all markets combined is expected to grow another 300 percent in 2015. While residential, commercial, and industrial (C&I) storage may represent just 10 percent of the overall market today, a recent GTM research report predicts behind-the-meter storage (residential, commercial, education, military or nonprofit) will account for 45 percent of the market by 2019. 

An integral aspect of energy storage technology relates to how battery technology fits within existing manufacturing process infrastructure. New and innovative battery technologies often require their own set of manufacturing processes and resources. This requires additional cost and time that can make potential partners averse to a new technology, since they will need to rethink their entire manufacturing process. BioSolar's patent pending manufacturing process, which takes full advantage of its unique cathode material properties, is compatible with current battery manufacturing processes, allowing battery manufacturers to more easily replace their cathode fabrication processes with BioSolar's high capacity Super Cathode materials and processes. 

""Energy storage within the utility sector has become one of the most popular areas for technology innovation and adoption,"" said Dr. David Lee, CEO of BioSolar. ""We believe our high capacity low-cost battery technology can be at the forefront of this high-growth market. We intend to demonstrate that our cathode manufacturing is compatible with current battery manufacturing processes, and project a clear path of how we will overcome the $100/kWh cost barrier needed for mass market adoption of battery technology. As we progress through development, we are confident that our Super Cathode will stand on its own as a technology with the potential to impact energy storage applications across many sectors."" 

The Company recently announced that it has jointly filed a patent application with the University of California, Santa Barbara (""UCSB"") in order to protect intellectual property rights which forms the basis for the company's super battery technology. 

About BioSolar, Inc. 

BioSolar is developing a breakthrough technology to double the storage capacity, lower the cost and extend the life of lithium-ion batteries. A battery contains two major parts, a cathode and an anode, that function together as the positive and negative sides. Today's state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery is limited by the storage capacity of its cathode, while the anode can store much more. Inspired by nature, we are developing a novel cathode based on inexpensive conductive polymers and organic materials that can fully utilize the storage capacity of conventional anodes. By integrating our high capacity, high power and low-cost cathode with conventional anodes, battery manufacturers can create a super lithium-ion battery that can double the range of a Tesla, power an iPhone for 2 days straight, or store daytime solar energy for nighttime use. Founded with the vision of developing breakthrough energy technologies, BioSolar's previous successes include the world's first UL approved bio-based back sheet for use in solar panels.

ec0e9b28-d4cc-4d0f-8b6c-ace3dbde0978,"A Lebanese man has slashed his throat in an attempted suicide at the Christmas Island detention centre, according to reports. A Lebanese man has slashed his throat in an attempted suicide at the Christmas Island detention centre, according to reports. The man, believed to be in his 20s and previously living in Melbourne, made the attempt at about 8pm local time on Friday.

It is understood he was a criminal deportee staying at the centre's White Two high security compound.

Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said he believed it was the man's third suicide attempt in 10 days.

""You have a punitive regime [at the White compound] that is reminiscent of a penal colony,"" he said.

""The kind of brutality, the kind of submission and the kind of disciplinary [tactics] that are dealt out... it simply beggars belief.""

Mr Rintoul said the man had lost a lot of blood, but the centre's officers had since taken him out of the compound and his condition was unknown.

The Immigration Department confirmed a ""self-harm incident"" had occurred at the North West Point Immigration Centre on Friday evening.

""The detainee is receiving appropriate medical and mental health support and care,"" a spokeswoman said.

She would not comment on the man's condition or where he had been transferred.

""It would be inappropriate to go into further detail about the incident or the individual circumstances of the detainee,"" she said.

Mr Rintoul said the detention centre was in lock down after the incident.

He said he believed the man was transferred from Melbourne about five months ago, but did not know what crime he had committed.

""Frankly, I think it's immaterial,"" he said.

""People can be 501s (criminal deportees) for a whole range of misdemeanours.

""The migration system allows for an extrajudicial form of punishment because people may be migrants or they may be asylum seekers or refugees.""

Under section 501 of the Migration Act, a non-Australian citizen's visa may be cancelled and the person extradited or held in detention for a number of reasons, including failing a character test or receiving a jail term of at least one year.

Mr Rintoul said the incident came two days after an Iraqi asylum seeker sliced his hand in a self-harm incident at the centre.

""Detention centres are not the places where people can get real support, real treatment for mental health difficulties that plague [them],"" he said.

Mr Rintoul called the conditions in the facility ""inhuman"" and not congruent with the criminal justice system.

""There needs to be a proper investigation,"" he said.

A spokesman for Secro, which manages the facility, said the private company would not comment and referred the matter to the department.

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton's office did not respond to Fairfax Media's calls. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","Lebanese man cuts his throat in third suicide attempt at Christmas Island, say refugee activists",News,Albury Border Mail,2015-09-19T02:55:15Z
370a83cb-7a89-4911-ac8c-e06566684d7f,"Transportation officials are finalizing agreements with two companies to build a $97-million streetcar line in Downtown El Paso, which was approved by City Council last year. 
  
The state-funded project will also refurbish and put back into use the historic streetcars, sometimes called trolleys, which were part of life and work in El Paso until the 1970s. 
 
The board of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, which is overseeing the project, selected the top scoring bidders from a shortlist at its Aug. 26 meeting. They are Paso del Norte Trackworks and Brookville Equipment Corp. 
 
Paso del Norte Trackworks, a joint venture of California-based Granite Construction Co. and New York-based RailWorks Track Systems, would be responsible for building the infrastructure, including tracks, maintenance and storage facilities, power stations and overhead wires. It outbid local company Jordan Foster for the job. 
 
Pennsylvania-based Brookville Equipment, one of only a handful of companies in the country that remanufactures PCC-type streetcars, would be responsible for resurrecting El Paso’s old streetcars, which sat for decades in the desert. 
 
If all goes according to plan, work could begin on the 4.8-mile streetcar route as early as January, Todd Keller, a vice president and regional manager for Granite Construction in Tucson, Arizona, told El Paso Inc. last week. 
 
Granite Construction, which describes itself as one of the top 25 largest construction companies in the U.S., had revenues of $2.3 billion last year. A publicly traded company (NYSE: GVA), Granite Construction has built massive bridges, freeways, dams and tunnels across the United States. 
 
Its partner, RailWorks Track Systems, said it has not received official notification that the company was the highest scoring bidder and could not comment. 
 
Last year, the joint venture completed a $197-million modern streetcar line in Tucson, Arizona, which began service in July 2014. The streetcars there sparked a Downtown renaissance, spurring $1.5 billion in private and public development along the route, Tucson city officials and business groups have reported. 
 
“If you look at the city of Tucson Downtown five years ago versus now, it is a night and day difference for economic development opportunity,” Keller said. 
 
The El Paso streetcar project is supported by $97 million in state funding. It will provide service from the Paso del Norte Port of Entry to the West El Paso neighborhood that is home to a campus of El Paso Community College, the University of Texas at El Paso and several hospitals. 
 
At the peak of construction, the Granite Construction joint venture will have as many as 170 workers on the project, Keller said. 
 
“Coordination with all the businesses and stakeholders will be very important,” he said. “That is one of the key considerations.” 
 
Construction will be tricky as the route passes through the busy arts, business, government, entertainment and shopping districts in Downtown, said Raymond Telles, executive director of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, which is overseeing the project. 
 
“We are going to affect a lot of people with this project, so we want to make it as painless as possible,” Telles said. 
 
Six of El Paso’s old streetcars will be transported to Brookville Equipment’s facilities in Pennsylvania and remanufactured. Originally, plans called for seven streetcars, but the cost of restoring the streetcars was greater than expected, $3.1 million per car, officials said. They hope to add a seventh car later using contingency funds that may be freed up when the project is done. 
 
“They will be completely remanufactured, taken down to their base components,” Telles told board members at the Aug. 26 meeting. 
 
Vehicle No. 1511, which was painted by the renowned artist Jose Cisneros, will be restored – art and all, according to Telles. 
 
The goal is for them “to run like new but look much the same as they did when they were running in the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s,” he said. 
 
They will be air conditioned, come with a three-year warranty, detailed operating manuals and an inventory of specialized spare parts. The company will also provide training. 
 
Board members expressed concern at the meeting that there was very little room in the budget for the price tag to grow and there are a lot of unknowns building in one of the oldest parts of the city, where underground utilities and basements aren’t always where they are expected. 
 
“The biggest enemy to this entire project, as we have all discussed and the public is aware, is change orders,” said Joe Wardy, a former El Paso mayor and vice chair of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority. 
 
Board members alluded to the long-delayed project to redo San Jacinto Plaza in Downtown, which has been plagued by change orders that have inflated the cost. 
 
Workers have combed sidewalks with ground penetrating radar where holes will be dug – 500 of them – along the streetcar route. 
 
“We’ve done a very thorough job of trying to identify what could possibly get in the way to make sure it is addressed in advance to minimize those risks, but they will happen. Downtown is 400 years old, and the infrastructure is a couple of hundred years old,” said Chuck Berry with engineering firm AECOM, which designed the system. 
 
No completion date has been set, but building the streetcar system is a years-long project, officials said.

db0f2642-4cf3-4b8c-982c-eee29530eed4,"Albion's failure to score for the first time this season at Wolves emphasised the one factor evidently occupying the hierarchy if a challenge for automatic promotion is to be maintained. 
 
Has Chris Hughton got enough goals in his squad? 
 
The Seagulls attempted to add another firepower option to their armoury at the end of the transfer window via their interest in Argentinian Jonathan Calleri and English-based Czech Matej Vydra. 
 
Glancing at the current Championship table, with Albion sitting proudly on top, there appears no reason for concern. 
 
Closer inspection reveals the goal tally could be a worry, recent history contrastingly suggests it need not be. 
 
Albion have found the net 11 times so far in their eight-match undefeated run. 
 
It should have been more. Hughton highlighted the need to be more clinical following last week's 2-1 home win against Rotherham. Tomer Hemed missed a penalty at Molineux, where Albion failed to break down ten men. 
 
It is a healthy enough haul, although they are being outscored by second-placed Middlesbrough and four others. 
 
They are also being matched by Fulham and Brentford, both languishing in the bottom half of the table. 
   Promoted stories   
As has always been the case in the Amex era, a sound defence is serving Albion well. The five goals conceded is the joint-lowest with Boro. 
 
The eighth match last season was also a 0-0. Interestingly, at that stage under Sami Hyypia, although 12 points fewer had been gathered, the Seagulls had only scored two goals fewer. 
 
Encouragingly for Hughton, five different players have found the net in the Championship. 
 
Hemed has raced to five, Kazenga LuaLua three. Sam Baldock is off the mark and Hughton will be particularly pleased his central midfielders, Dale Stephens and Beram Kayal, have contributed as well. 
 
Ironically, considering Lewis Dunk finished overall top scorer last season, Albion are waiting for their first goal from a defender. 
 
Does it really matter? Is success in the Championship determined by the number of goals you score? Apparently not. 
 
In 2012-13, when Albion reached the play-offs under Gus Poyet , they accumulated 69 goals. 
 
Every other team in the top six scored more, with one notable exception. Hull hit only 61, yet still went up automatically as runners-up. 
 
The case against goals governing where you finish was strengthened further by the manner in which Oscar Garcia's Albion sneaked into the play-offs the following season. 
 
A modest tally of 55 was better only than six of the bottom seven. The key was having the second-best defence, with just 40 goals conceded. 
   
 Share article  
   
So it is possible to thrive if, like Hull, Oscar's Albion and Hughton's Seagulls to date this season, you keep the back door locked and keep on coming out on the right side of the tight games that clutter the Championship. 
 
It is just a lot tougher on the nerves.",Talking Point: Concerned Albion do not score enough goals? Worry no more,News,Brighton & Hove Argus,2015-09-25T12:00:00Z

Unique application of electronics and photonics drives down cost per bit and power consumption

PASADENA, California 

Rockley Photonics, innovators in optical solutions for next-generation networks, has demonstrated breakthrough technology that will enable operators to create a new generation of mega data centers using optical switching within the heart of the network.

Experts predict that data traffic in cloud data centers may require 1000 times more bandwidth than that deployed today in order to keep up with demand for Internet services over the next 10 years.

Many believe that current network technologies within existing data centers have reached their economical scaling limits; they are incapable of supporting the future needs of the data center market - a sector valued in excess of $10bn 

Engineers at Rockley Photonics are applying integrated solutions in electronics and photonics to get the best out of each technology in a way that will transform the design of future data centers, supporting higher data rates at significantly lower cost and power.

""Major operators tell us that they are on 'red alert' when it comes to scaling the network to support their future data center requirements,"" said Andrew Rickman 

We have now demonstrated the ability to combine photonics and electronics in a unique architecture, which will enable us to simplify switch design, create vastly more scalable networks using much larger switches, and drive down the cost per bit while substantially reducing power consumption.""

Rockley Photonics is now prototyping its architecture using programmable chips (FPGAs) and custom photonic devices to prove the concept of scalable optical packet switching in a realistic system environment. Once it has fully evaluated the scalable system architecture, the company will move the design from its prototyping platform to system chips for production purposes. Commercial availability of these products is scheduled in 2017. Rockley Photonics Rockley Photonics (http://www.rockleyphotonics.com) was founded in August 2013 

It helps customers achieve next-generation bandwidth requirements economically by providing more scalable and lower-cost data center networks that keep pace with Moore's Law and the growth in data processing speeds.

The growth of the global solar PV market is expected to remain robust, with installations expected to expand by 23 percent year-on-year, in 2015 and then continuing to grow at a CAGR of 14 percent through 2018.

Even with this expected rapid growth, the global cumulative solar PV-based electricity generation capacity by the end of 2018 is expected to add up to less than 7 percent of the total global electricity generation installed capacity, accounting for less than 4 percent of global electricity generation.

According to the Stifel report, “With one of the leading cost structures and manufacturing capabilities, we expect Canadian Solar to continue to deliver mid- to high-teens gross margins.”

In addition, the company has strengthened its downstream development operations with the acquisition of Recurrent Energy, with its late-stage project pipeline expanding to 2.4GW.

The Portland Press Herald reports the Massachusetts Medical Examiner’s Office plans to perform an autopsy on the 59-year-old’s body. The Coast Guard says it received a distress call around 7pm Friday saying the woman had fallen overboard the Seabourn Quest when the ship was about 10 miles off Cape Ann. They say the ship left Boston Friday afternoon and was bound for Bar Harbor, Maine. An FBI spokeswoman says her agency has nothing more to say until the autopsy is completed.

They are proud to announce this affiliation and are looking forward to servicing all international shipping needs. 

Importing and exporting are key components for many lucrative businesses. International shipping could present great business opportunities for so many, but may also seem daunting. 
   
The process, paperwork, and regulations involved in international trade may seem intimidating. However, anyone can be a successful international shipper without getting caught up in the logistics of logistics. 
That's what a freight forwarder is for. 

What is a freight forwarder? 

A freight forwarder ( http://worldwidelogisticsltd.com/ ) is a company that arranges importing and exporting of goods. 

So what does that actually mean in terms of what a freight forwarder does? 

What does a freight forwarder actually do? 

There is a lot that goes into arranging international shipping. While the freight forwarder handles the details of international shipping, it is important to know what a freight forwarder does not do in order to understand what a freight forwarder actually does. 

A freight forwarder does not actually move the freight itself. 

The freight forwarder acts as an intermediary between a shipper and various transportation services such as ocean shipping on cargo ships, trucking, expedited shipping by air freight, and moving goods by rail. 

A freight forwarding ( http://worldwidelogisticsltd.com/ ) service utilizes established relationships with carriers, from air freighters and trucking companies, to rail freighters and ocean liners, in order to negotiate the best possible price to move shippers' goods along the most economical route by working out various bids and choosing the one that best balances speed, cost, and reliability. 

Freight forwarders handle the considerable logistics of shipping goods from one international destination to another, a task that would otherwise be a formidable burden for their client. 

About Worldwide Logistics Ltd. 

Worldwide Logistics Ltd. was formed with a single goal. That is to create a logistics company that could offer competitive and comprehensive solutions without compromising personal service.

4ab7bb83-6f7e-46b8-af23-a954d372a6ac,"When the curtain came down Friday night on Smuin Ballet's season opener -- Dance Series One -- it was clear that ""Broken Open,"" by company choreographer-in-residence Amy Seiwert, had more heft and complexity than the rest of the evening combined.

The first thing one notices in Seiwert's work is her keen craftsmanship. She has the dancers slip in from the curtains upstage as well as wash in from the sides to a silky mix of driving strings and bass heartbeats, provided by composer and cellist Julia Kent. 

Employing the traditional male-female partnerships, the choreographer keeps our eyes trained on couples whose rapidly angled limbs by turns break open, gather, then explode across the stage in razor sharp turns, before they disappear. 

The splatter of color on the men's shirts and women's leotards, as in a bouquet of wildflowers, gave Seiwert's cool, organic movements and architecture the heat of a well-designed garden, though the bathing tank-style leotards for the women (designed by Sandra Woodall) made them appear shorter than they are. The designer's concentration of color on the dancers' torsos, though, was inspired. And Brian Jones' lighting for this work added a wonderful luminosity to the action.

Choreographer Ma Cong's ""French Twist,"" which opened the evening at the Dean Lesher Theater in Walnut Creek, was catchy and athletic, if predictable. Conjuring up the punchy athleticism and pop sensuality of ODC and Twyla Tharp, ""French Twist"" flowed from devilish couplings -- multiple duets, male quartets and large ensembles -- that slurped and exploded. Susan Roemer and Weston Krukow gave ""French Twist"" its keen edge.While physically clever, fast moving and cheeky, the movement was not helped by the decor -- a pale gray drop with triangles, squares and rounds reminiscent of children's building blocks, which drained the stage of color. Noir fog further blurred any sense of time and place, and the costumes, featuring white button-down shirts, undercut the cartoon sensibility of the steps. The music, by Hugues Le Bars, only confused the picture further, making it seem as if this gray dance should have been in Technicolor.

Company dancer and budding choreographer Ben Needham-Wood premiered ""Maslow,"" which he dedicated to Abraham Maslow, the noted psychologist, and his concept of human potential. Set to an original score by Ben Sollee, this work is essentially a New Yorker-style cartoon depiction of a man's search for self. Had ""Maslow"" come first in the program, rather than third, it might have mattered less that the protagonist (Robert Kretz) doesn't actually locate his potential, but does find an entire crowd in his psyche.

Michael Smuin's ""Bouquet"" (1981) offered a bit of classicism with music by Shostakovich. But on the same program with Seiwert's ""Broken Open,"" it felt pointless. 

""Open"" was not perfect, but its visual, kinesthetic and musical aliveness made it the sister who, dressed in Prada, makes her plainly dressed siblings look shabby.

The logic of leaving the best dance for last, so audiences will remain captive and be enticed to return for the next program, works sometimes -- especially when the program is balanced. But Dance Series One lacks that balance, and some tinkering with the lineup could perhaps make all the works shine brighter.

d9fad4cb-ed52-4184-a56a-f0fc82d6c80c,"HONG KONG (CNNMoney) – Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan cut interest rates for the fourth time this year on Tuesday, a policy change made possible by slowing inflation in Asia’s third-largest economy. 

The RBI cut the rate at which it lends to banks by 0.5 percentage points to 6.75%, a larger reduction than economists had expected. Two of the bank’s previous cuts — made in January and March — were unscheduled surprises. 

“With the Fed hesitating to cut rates, the Reserve Bank of India now has a window of opportunity to ease its policy rate once more this year before opting for a pause,” economists at Societe Gererale said in a research note. 

Investors cheered the news, sending Mumbai’s Sensex into positive territory. But Rajan sounded a note of caution about the health of India’s economy. 

“In India, a tentative economic recovery is underway, but is still far from robust,” Rajan said in a statement. The central bank governor said that global financial markets had become more unstable in recent months, and took note of increased economic risks in China, Brazil, Russia and South Africa. 

As a result, he said, the RBI’s policy stance “will continue to be accommodative.” 

Unlike some other central banks, the RBI is not legally independent, and can be more susceptible to shifting political whims. Rajan, a former IMF chief economist, has been under intense political pressure to cut rates. 

But analysts see other reasons for this rate cut. 

“We believe the move will come as result of the easing path of inflation, and not because of increased government pressure,” the Societe Gererale economists said.",Reserve Bank of India slashes interest rates,News,997WTN.com,2015-09-29T06:14:43Z

94f91920-9dca-412f-b6d3-935675ec2f3a,"HOUSTON — Collin McHugh went 7 2-3 innings and Hank Conger hit a grand slam as the Houston Astros beat the Minnesota Twins 8-0 on Friday night. 

McHugh (15-7) gave up seven hits and struck out six in picking up his second straight win. McHugh has allowed two runs or fewer in each of his last six starts. 

Colby Rasmus had two hits, including a monstrous two-run homer into the upper deck in right field in the second inning to give the Astros a 3-0 lead. 

Conger upped the lead to 7-0 with the grand slam in the fourth into the Crawford Boxes in left field. After Evan Gattis, Jed Lowrie and Carlos Gomez led off the inning with singles, Mike Pelfrey (6-9) struck out the next two hitters to set up Conger's second grand slam of the season. 

Conger, who had not hit a grand slam before this season, hit his first career grand slam Aug. 1, against Arizona. He added an RBI single in the eighth. 

Carlos Correa's RBI fielder's choice in the first gave Houston a 1-0 lead. 

Lowrie had three hits and scored twice, and Gattis had two hits for Houston. 

Pelfrey was tagged for seven runs and eight hits with five strikeouts in four innings. It was Pelfrey's second straight outing of four innings or less — both against the Astros. Pelfrey lasted just 3 2-3 innings in his last start against the Astros on Saturday, allowing four runs in a 4-1 loss. 

Joe Mauer had two hits and the best chance to score for Minnesota but was thrown out at home by Gomez trying to score on Miguel Sano's single in the first. The Twins did not get a runner past second base the rest of the way. 

TRAINER'S ROOM 

Twins: RHP Phil Hughes (lower back inflammation) is expected to throw off a mound in Minneapolis this weekend and will join the club in Kansas City for a simulated game next week. 

Astros: OF George Springer was activated from the 15-day DL on Friday and started in right field. Springer went on the DL with a right wrist fracture on July 2. He went 1 for 4 with a single. 

TEN ASTROS WITH TEN HOMERS 

The grand slam was Conger's 10th home run of the season, giving the Astros 10 players with 10 or more home runs, breaking the franchise record of nine set in 2000. The major league record is 11 players with 10 or more home runs set by the Detroit Tigers in 2004. 

UP NEXT 

Twins: RHP Ervin Santana (3-4) goes Saturday in the second game of the three-game series. Santana threw seven shutout innings with 10 strikeouts in his last start Sunday against the Astros. 

Astros: RHP Lance McCullers (5-5) matches up for a second straight start against Santana after taking the loss Sunday, giving up three runs in six innings.","McHugh, Conger lead Houston to 8-0 win over Twins",News,Boston Herald,2015-09-05T03:01:00Z

f6e42f7e-5619-4ef7-87f4-ae4c32cc7d39,"Same issue. Different year. 
 
A bill that would restore funding diverted in 2011 from the state’s four newest cities – all in Riverside County – has landed on Gov. Jerry Brown’s desk. Again. 
 
Officials in Eastvale, Wildomar, Menifee and Jurupa Valley, stung by Brown’s two previous vetoes of bills that would have restored state funding to them, were pragmatic about whether the governor would sign SB25 into law. 
 
“I hold out very little hope, but I pray every night that he does,” said Wildomar Mayor Ben Benoit. 
 
Brown has 30 days from Sept. 8, the day SB25 got to his desk, to either sign the bill or veto it. If he takes no action, SB25 becomes law. 
 
SB25, which was introduced by state Sen. Richard Roth, D-Riverside, is virtually identical to SB69, which was Brown vetoed in September 2014. Roth also sponsored SB69. 
 
In his veto message, Brown cited concerns about the “long-term costs to the general fund that this bill would occasion.” 
 
Eastvale City Manager Michele Nissen said the state’s financial picture has improved markedly over the past year. 
 
“Now he’s got a revenue surplus,” Nissen said. 
 
Eastvale and Jurupa Valley have written letters signed by their respective mayors urging the governor to sign the bill to ease the four cities’ financial hardship. 
 
Eastvale, Menifee, Wildomar and Jurupa Valley have lost millions annually since June 2011, when state legislators voted to divert vehicle-license fee revenue from cities to law enforcement grants. 
 
All California cities lost vehicle-license fee revenue, but the four newest cities received a greater share to make up for property taxes that cities formed after 2004 don’t get. 
 
All have had to cut back on services, including law enforcement, but none have been affected as badly as Jurupa Valley, which became a city two days after the vote. 
 
SB25 would return the estimated $16 million per year to the four cities in property tax money that normally goes to education. 
 
Because state law requires full funding for education, that money would have to be repaid from the general fund. 
 
Jurupa Valley has lost an estimated $25 million over the past four years and has taken an initial step toward disincorporation. 
 
Although Jurupa Valley’s financial situation has improved, the city still owes more than $18 million to Riverside County in unpaid transition year costs, law enforcement costs and revenue neutrality payments. 
 
Menifee Mayor Scott Mann said Brown has had multiple opportunities to restore vehicle-license fee funding rescinded as part of his public safety realignment plan in 2011. And there has been no indication from the governor, or his staff, that he will approve it this time either, Mann said.

Fifa president Sepp Blatter has pledged his support for US and Swiss criminal investigations into the organisation. 
               
Sepp Blatter has urged Fifa to support American and Swiss investigations of corruption in football, even as both criminal cases may target him. 
 
The embattled governing body should cooperate ""no matter how close to home those investigations get,"" Blatter wrote in his weekly Fifa magazine column. 
 
This is the difficult path we must follow if we are serious about change,"" the Fifa president said. 
 
 READ MORE:  Ranieri shows serious side  
 
His magazine column was published the day after Switzerland's Attorney General Michael Lauber pressured Fifa to stop blocking the requested handover of Jerome Valcke's emails. 
 
Fifa suspended Valcke as secretary general last week, hours after he was linked to a proposed deal for black-market World Cup ticket sales. 
 
""We need to show that we understand the severity of this situation and that we are ready to take the right steps to fix it,"" Blatter wrote. 
 
US Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Lauber said last week at a shared news conference in Zurich that their respective cases implicating senior Fifa officials are expanding, and could yet indict Blatter. 
 
The US case alleging bribery and racketeering among Fifa vice presidents and longtime executive committee members has indicted 14 people and taken guilty pleas from four others. 
 
A Swiss case that started with Fifa's complaint last year of possible money laundering in the 2018-2022 World Cup bid contests is now looking for evidence of criminal mismanagement across Fifa's day-to-day business. 
 
Blatter has denied wrongdoing and blamed corruption on individuals outside Fifa's control. 
 
In his column, Blatter linked the criminal investigations to the need for reforming Fifa when his 18-year presidency ends in February, after a previous round of modernising changes fell short. 
 
""However, the highly regrettable events this year have made it painfully clear those changes have not been enough,"" he wrote. 
 
Failing to approve reforms at the February 26 election congress in Zurich would be a ""betrayal"" of Fifa by the 209 member federations, Blatter suggested. 
 
Some reforms, including term limits for top officials, were rejected by those same members last year in Brazil after Blatter told them that rules forced upon Fifa would later apply worldwide. 
 
Still, Blatter reminded that ""millions of fans around the world ... rightly expect the highest standards from those managing the game.""","Fifa boss Sepp Blatter urges support for US, Swiss criminal cases into corruption",News,Taranaki Daily News,2015-09-24T17:49:32Z

GEORGE BEATO, an Army veteran of World War II, was delivering pies in Fairmount for a baking company after the war when he made an observation that would change his life: 
 
The blue-collar neighborhood had practically no sandwich shops. 
 
George decided he would remedy that deficiency. He borrowed $500 from a butcher with whom he had become friendly, and in 1954 opened Beato's Pizza, on Parrish Street. 
 
George Beato, who died Sept. 16 at age 91, almost immediately won the hearts of fellow business people and the hard-working folks in blue-collar Fairmount with his ebullient personality, his wit and his generosity. 
   
""He never said no to people and would provide a meal to anyone, regardless of their ability to pay,"" his family said. ""Having grown up poor, George knew what it was like to go to bed hungry and he never wanted to see anyone ever go through that, especially a child. 
 
""Patrons weren't just customers, they became his friends, regardless of race, creed or social status. Beato's became the hangout for several generations of Fairmounters over the years. 
 
""People always knew when George was there, as his meticulously kept Cadillac would be parked out front, and would often stop in just to say hello."" 
 
Beato's became famous for its cheesesteaks, and word spread throughout the city. Soon, people were driving in from the outskirts. 
 
Among customers were the late Mayor James H.J. Tate, former District Attorney Lynne Abraham, Police Commissioner and later Mayor Frank Rizzo and his brother, Joe, the fire commissioner. Boxer Jimmy Young and ""the Geator with the Heater"" Jerry Blavat were customers. 
 
George's cheesesteak won the first Philadelphia magazine ""Best of Philly"" award, and several more after that. 
 
On one wall of his eatery was a photograph of George with Frank Rizzo. Another was of Patrick Ward, a Fairmount boy who worked for him and was killed in Vietnam. 
 
George was a big supporter of police and firefighters, and donated annually to the Hero Scholarship Fund supported by the Police and Fire Thrill Show. 
 
To show his gratitude for the first-responders, he never charged them for meals. If they insisted on paying, he charged them $2. He was made an honorary member of the Police and Fire departments and proudly displayed his badges. 
 
George died suddenly at his home in the Northeast. 
 
He was born in Philadelphia to Italian immigrants Philip and Carmela Beato. He was raised in South Philadelphia and dropped out of South Philadelphia High School in the 11th grade to go to work to help his family in the Depression. 
 
He met his future wife, Phyllis Romano, at a neighborhood dance when he was 18 and she was 17. They eloped and married in 1942. 
 
George worked for a butcher shop in the Italian Market and drove a cab before being drafted into the Army. 
 
He served from 1943 to 1945 as a military policeman. Because he was fluent in Italian, he was assigned to interrogate Italian prisoners. 
 
In 1990, after nearly 37 years in the restaurant business, often working 18-hour days, George decided to call it quits. He sold Beato's and retired. 
 
Besides his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Marie Marandolo and Phyllis Faith; seven grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. 
 
Services: Funeral Mass 10:30 a.m. Thursday at St. Matthew Church, 3000 Cottman Ave. Friends may call at 6:30 p.m. tomorrow and at 9 a.m. Thursday at the John F. Givnish Funeral Home, 10975 Academy Road. Interment will be private.

An overturned tractor-trailer that wrecked Thursday morning on State Route 109 northbound in northern Wilson County near Cherokee Dock Drive and the Sumner County line has been cleared. 

The crash, which occurred around 10:40 a.m., has partially blocked traffic in both directions for much of the day. The clearing estimate was first set for 3 p.m., and then extended. It was cleared according to the Tennessee Department of Transportation's SmartWay map before 3:30 p.m. 

Serious injuries weren't immediately reported from the wreck, according to Highway Patrol dispatchers.

109a289d-1727-43da-bbc4-72eb246a4258,"The London market surged 2.6% higher today after a profit upgrade from supermarket Sainsbury's and gains from hard-hit miner Glencore, but still slid to its worst quarterly fall in four years. 

The FTSE 100 Index added 152.4 points to 6061.6 - after losing 200 points over the previous two sessions - amid a global market fight-back as equity volatility shows no sign of abating. 

Markets rose overnight on Wall Street and Asia, with Europe following suit. In London there was only one faller in the top flight. 

The Dax in Germany and France's Cac 40 were around 2.5% higher. In New York the Dow Jones Industrial Average is around 200 points up in early trading. 

But experts said global markets had hit their worst quarterly performance for four years after a lengthy rout that started in August as fears emerged over China's slowing economy. 

The top flight is 7% down compared to the previous quarter, its sharpest fall since September 2011. 

In London, the rally was also helped by economic cheer as the latest national accounts figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the UK economy emerged from recession more strongly than previously thought. 

The ONS said growth was stronger between 2011 and 2013 than first estimated as it also confirmed second quarter growth of 0.7%. 

The pound was a cent up against the euro at just over 1.35, but was slightly lower against the US dollar at just over 1.51. 

Among stocks, Sainsbury's saw its shares soar by 14% or 31.7p to 261p after it said full-year profits would now be ""moderately"" ahead of City expectations after narrowing sales declines in its second quarter. 

The chain posted a 1.1% drop in like-for-like second-quarter sales, excluding fuel - its seventh quarter of falling sales in a row. 

But the decline was better than the 2.1% fall seen in the previous three months and Sainsbury's said it saw the number of sales and transactions rise, while it added that lower average basket spend in supermarkets continued to stabilise. 

Other supermarkets followed it higher, with Tesco 11.9p up at 183.2p and Morrisons 10p ahead at 166.1p. 

Glencore was the biggest blue-chip riser after a dramatic 29% slump on Monday after reissuing a statement first released late yesterday assuring it was ""operationally and financially robust"" and pledging to slash its 30 billion US dollar (£19.8 billion) debt pile by a third. 

Its shares rose by another 14%, or 11.3p to 91.6p, following a 17% bounce-back yesterday. 

Energy giant SSE also gained strongly after a bullish update, lifting 4% or 59p to 1496p after saying it expected to earn around a third of its full-year profits in the first half after a robust performance from its wholesale arm and ""relatively good"" half-year for its residential energy supply business. 

The biggest risers on the FTSE 100 index were Glencore up 11.3p at 91.6p, Sainsbury's up 31.7p at 261p, Tesco up 11.9p at 183.2p and Morrisons up 10p at 166.1p.

Republicans in the US Congress opposing the Iran nuclear agreement are not giving up despite losing to Democrats this week, they are plotting additional attacks to undercut the deal, a report says. 

On Thursday, Senate Democrats blocked a Republican resolution to reject the historic Vienna accord between Iran and the P5+1 group of countries, ensuring that the deal can be implemented without Obama having to use his veto power. 

“This vote is a victory for diplomacy, for American national security, and for the safety and security of the world,” President Barack Obama said after the vote. 

Republican senators, who only a few months earlier vowed to muster 67 votes to override a presidential veto, fell two votes short needed to break a Democratic filibuster. 

But, in the House of Representatives, Republicans succeeded to pass a resolution against the Iran agreement by 162 to 269 votes on Friday. 

Disgrace in the House 
Former Democratic Senator Mike Gravel 
The House vote, however, is symbolic that will have no consequence for the implementation of the nuclear agreement, reached between Iran and the P5+1 -- the US, Britain, Russia, China, France, and Germany -- in Vienna in mid-July. 

“The fact that the House voted for this, all they have shown is their political opinions, it has no validity in law and it’s a disgrace,” Former Democratic Senator Mike Gravel told Press TV on Saturday. 

“It is clearly led by the AIPAC’s influence on the House members and the Congress,” added Gravel, a candidate in the 2008 US presidential election. 

'We’ll use every tool' 
John Boehner (L) with Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel 
According to the Washington-based The Hill newspaper, Republicans in both chambers are now conspiring to launch new attacks to either undermine the accord or force Democrats to cast the same vote all over again. 

“This debate is far from over and, frankly, it's just beginning,” House Speaker John Boehner, Republican from Ohio, vowed this week. 

“This is a bad deal with decades-long consequences for the security of the American people and our allies,” he declared. 

“And we'll use every tool at our disposal to stop, slow and delay this agreement from being fully implemented,” added Boehner, who earlier this year even invited the Israeli premier to Washington, DC to speak against the Iran deal. 

One more vote on Tuesday  
US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell 
In the Senate, minutes after Democrats filibustered legislation opposing the agreement, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said senators will vote on the Iran deal one more time on Tuesday. 

“We’ll revisit the issue next week, and see if maybe any folks want to change their minds,” the visibly shaken McConnell said on Thursday. 

And his deputy, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn told reporters, “It will be all Iran next week.” 

“There are going to be more votes,” he said. “There will be other opportunities for people to change their mind next week, hopefully after they hear from their constituents. 

Lawsuit threat against Obama 
US President Barack Obama 
Speaking with reporters on Thursday, Boehner threatened to sue Obama in order to stop him from finalizing the Iran deal. 

He said during a news conference on Capitol Hill that legal action is “an option that’s very possible.” 

“If you read the provisions in [the congressional review law], it’s pretty clear that the president has not complied,” the Republican said. 

Republicans hollow posturing

Analysts, however, say that Republicans cannot stop the historic Vienna accord now; they are only hollow posturing to gain money from the Israel lobby. 

Republican attempts such as holding a secondary vote or suing Obama are “all just hollow posturing on the part of the Republicans for money from the Israel lobby primarily, but also trying to create some type of issue for the upcoming presidential election,” E. Michael Jones told Press TV on Thursday.

Jones, former professor and editor of Culture Wars magazine, also revealed that the European states involved in the nuclear negotiations with Iran warned Congress to approve the agreement or the Europeans would lift sanctions unilaterally. 

“The European component to this deal sent a delegation to the United States’ Congress and said ‘if you do this [disapprove of the agreement], we’re leaving, we’re out of here, we’re going to lift the sanctions unilaterally,’” he stated. 

“And that carried the day with these people because they know that the United States can’t continue this without them… Republicans know this, they were in on the briefing” he noted. ",GOP hatches new plot against Iran deal,News,PressTV.com,2015-09-13T02:38:30Z

This sets a dangerous precedent in the abuse of law and property rights. He contends that Senate Bill 443 would allow criminal organizations to benefit from the law but he doesn’t mention that current asset forfeiture laws allow the taking of property from individuals with no ties to criminal organizations and without a conviction. 
 
The taking of property without due process of the courts and a conviction heretofore, amounts to nothing short of legalized theft and should be illegal. As a constitutional conservative, I believe it is high time for this reform.

Battery-powered cars cause more pollution 
 
Staff columnist John Seiler provided some excellent information on electric, battery-powered vehicles [“Past efforts to promote electric cars ran out of juice,” Opinion, Aug. 26], but he neglected to mention the most important one. That is that the California Air Resources Board has been lying to us all these years. Since the system efficiency of battery-powered vehicles is less than for gasoline-powered ones, they must pollute more as long as we obtain electricity by burning gas, coal, oil or whatever else goes into the generator furnace. The system efficiency of a gasoline engine is 20 percent, a power plant is 35 percent, and a diesel engine is 40 percent. The system efficiency of an electric vehicle is less because of the batteries, in spite of the higher power-plant efficiency, but what is an electric vehicle without batteries? From the thermal efficiencies given, it is obvious that the most efficient, i.e. least-polluting, vehicle would be a diesel hybrid. Where are they? Even more important is: Why has CARB been lying to us all these years?

These higher prices have been driven by shrinking cattle supplies and generally good demand from feedyards with excess feeding capacity. 
 
Recent cattle on feed reports have indicated that cattle feeders have been placing more lighter weight calves on feed as available supplies of feeder cattle have decreased. As discussed in last week’s  article , placements of calves weighing less than 600 lb were 10% higher in May compared to a year ago. As a result of this trend towards placing lighter weight calves on feed, the value of gain for these light weight calves is quite high. For example, during the first half of June, 350 lb steer calves in South Dakota averaged $274.96/cwt or $962.36/head. Steer calves weighing 450 lb averaged $280.17/cwt or $1260.77/head. Thus, the market’s valuation for the additional 100 lb of weight was $298.41/cwt. 
 
Similar calculations reveal that the market’s valuation for the next 100 lb of weight gain (from 450 lb to 550 lb) drops substantially to $156.64/cwt. Another 100 lb of weight (550 lb to 650 lb) currently costs $107.56/cwt at market prices. The market’s lowest valuation for cost of gain is from 650 lb to 750 lb: $70.88/cwt. Beyond that weight, the market’s value for weight gain increases to $103.21/cwt (750 lb to 850 lb) and then is $81.81/cwt for 850 lb to 950 lb. 
 
Considering these market valuations for additional weight on feeder cattle is particularly useful in the context of actual feeding cost of gain. While cost of gain varies across feedyards due to differences in feed rations, purchasing and hedging decisions, and other production and performance variables, many feedyards currently would have a projected feeding cost of gain around $87-93/cwt for yearling placements. At an average feeding cost of gain of $90/cwt, the market value of incremental weight is higher for all weights except from 650 lb to 750 lb and 850 lb to 950 lb. In other words, for all weights (particularly lighter weight calves), feedyards are better off purchasing lighter weight calves and putting the weight on them rather than buying the additional weight at current market prices. The exception to that (at least during the first half of June) was that it would have been more economical to purchase a 750 lb steer instead of a 650 lb steer or a 950 lb steer instead of an 850 lb steer. 
 
While these relationships do change as market conditions change, it does help explain why cattle feeders have been aggressively placing light weight feeder calves. Additionally, they are likely targeting better seasonal fed cattle prices in early 2015 by placing light weight calves rather than lower late-summer and early fall markets that heavy weight yearlings would have been placed against. Another consideration is that lighter weight feeder cattle cost fewer total dollars per head than heavier weight yearlings. At near record high feeder cattle prices and fewer outside investors interested in feeding cattle, a feedyard’s working capital needs are very high and the incentive is there to spend fewer dollars per head to obtain feeder cattle.

The order was given after intelligence reports revealed that the Islamic State terror group was planning a chemical attack on Kurds in the east of the country. 

Last night a team of 60 SAS soldiers were accompanying a US chemical warfare team in the hunt for the chlorine warehouse, said to be situated in a heavily fortified ISIS stronghold 50 miles from the Iraq border. 

According to Kurdish sources, the weapons may have been placed in an underground bunker to protect them from Nato air strikes. 

However, air strikes would not have been used against this target for fear of releasing the gas.

THE documents filed on Thursday state prosecutors would pursue the death penalty against Dylann Roof, 21, because more than two people were killed, and that others' lives were put at risk. 

Prosecutors also said they intended to present evidence on Roof's mental state, adult and juvenile criminal record and other conduct, as well as his apparent lack of remorse for the killings. 

Roof faces state charges including nine murder counts in the June 17 slayings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. 

He is expected in court again on those charges in October. 

He also faces federal charges including hate crimes and obstruction of the practice of religion, some of which are also eligible for the death penalty in that system.

7f419970-2e78-4635-bcd7-55d2091f74fd,"Days before a stop in Cuba on his way to the United States, Pope Francis on Thursday told young people from both countries that government heads who fail to plant the seeds of future leadership are ""worthless ... dictators."" 
 
Francis, who was elected in 2013, has been credited for being the chief advocate for renewing diplomatic ties between Washington and Havana. 

The Pope on Thursday responded from the Vatican to questions from students in Havana and New York during a CNN en Español teleconference on his Scholas initiative, which seeks to bring young people together via sports, art and technology. The event was held in partnership with the United Nations Children's Fund. 

Asked by a Cuban student about the example of his leadership, Francis said, ""I will tell you one thing, a good leader is one who is capable of bringing up other leaders. If a leader wants to lead alone, he is a tyrant. True leadership is fruitful. Each one of you has the seed of leadership."" 

He added, ""The leaders of today will not be here tomorrow. If they do not plant the seed of leadership in others, they are worthless. They are dictators."" 

Francis, the first pope from Latin America, earned praise from both U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro for helping restart relations between the neighboring countries. 

In July, the two countries reopened embassies in Havana and Washington. 

Pope Francis' whirlwind tour to Cuba and the United States begins Saturday, when he arrives in Havana for a trip that includes mass at Revolution Square, a meeting with government officials and a visit to the Shrine of Our Lady of Charity del Cobre, the island's patron saint. 

The Pope will be the third consecutive leader of the Roman Catholic Church to visit Cuba. St. John Paul II stopped there for several days in 1998, and Pope Benedict XVI visited for three days in 2012. 

Relations between the Vatican and Cuba, strained during the 49-year rule of communist dictator Fidel Castro, have improved since the younger Castro replaced his sickly brother as president. 

Cuba was officially atheist from 1962-1992, and an annual State Department report issued last year said religious activity there is only allowed ""if explicitly authorized"" by the government. The Catholic Church estimates between 60% and 70% of Cubans are baptized. 

Another Cuban student Friday urged the Pope to remember the poor and marginalized and to pray for a lifting of the longstanding U.S. embargo against Cuba. 

Francis said he would do ""all that is possible"" to ""build bridges"" and foster communication leading to friendship.

The post appeared first on Digital…  
The 55-year long hunt for the Porsche 550 Spyder that actor James Dean famously died in might finally be over. 

24-year old Dean died on his way to a race in Salinas, California, on September 30th, 1955. His tiny 550 Spyder — which he had nicknamed Little Bastard — collided head-on with a much larger Ford Tudor that turned left right in front him at an intersection. 

The totaled 550 was sold for parts and, after bits and pieces of it were fitted to other Porsches, it eventually wound up in the hands of George Barris, a world-renown customizer and builder whose work includes the 1960s Batmobile. When Barris ultimately decided not to rebuild the car, he loaned it to the National Safety Council so that it could be used to raise motorists’ awareness about highway safety. The 550 was often displayed next to a sign that read “this accident could have been avoided 

…” 

The 550 mysteriously went missing in 1960 while it was being transported from Miami, Florida, to Los Angeles, California. Since then, many have claimed to know what happened to it but none of the reports and rumors have materialized. 

In 2005, the Volo Auto Museum located on the outskirts of Chicago, Illinois, publicly offered to buy the car for $1 million. The museum got its first promising tip last spring when a man called to say he knows exactly where the car is located because he was present when it was stashed away.

Almost two million people are expected to take part in this year's pilgrimage, undeterred by a crane collapse in Mecca earlier this month that killed 109 people and injured nearly 400 at Islam's holiest site.

This year's pilgrimage begins against a backdrop of increased militant violence, a surge of the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus and with Saudi Arabia at war in Yemen.

The first day of the haj is known as Tarwiyah Day, when pilgrims traditionally watered their animals and stocked water for their trip to Mount Arafat, about 10km south-east of Mina. Nowadays, pilgrims spend their time there in prayer and reciting the Quran.

The climax of the haj season is on Arafat Day, today.

If you’ve been feeling a little uninspired today, we can’t quite blame you. It is Tuesday, after all. 

Luckily, we’ve got just the shot in the arm you need to propel you in your after-school workout, sports practice, or even just through the assigned English reading. The WNBA ’s new “Watch Me” campaign launched today, to coincide with the third game of the playoffs, and provides all the girl power you could possibly want. 

The first spot opens with, “I know what you’re thinking. You think I can’t,” calling out each and every naysayer who has had a discouraging or disparaging comment for the basketball players. With footage from both on the courts and off, the WNBA shows that these women are not only extremely powerful in their jerseys (look at those dunks!), but also in their everyday lives. They’re shattering the idea that women’s sports only appeal to women or that strong women can’t also be feminine, while showing that there’s so much more to these amazing athletes than their hoop skills (though, those are pretty spectacular). 

The minute-long video features current superstar players like Brittany Griner and Candace Parker, as well as six-time WNBA all-star Becky Hammon , who happens to be the first female full-time regular-season assistant coach in the NBA for the San Antonio Spurs. 

We’re all about badass female athletes telling their haters to step aside and we’ll definitely use this video as inspiration any time someone tells us that we can’t do something. Especially if the reason is our gender. 

Watch the video above, and get pumped up. And catch the rest of the campaign as the WNBA playoffs (tonight: Washington Mystics at New York Liberty and Los Angeles Sparks at Minnesota Lynx) continue.

269e0851-679c-4d76-abbc-78569690d511,"Frustration. Joy. Hope. They’re not always found in the same place. But all three were clear to see at a rally for developmental services funding today at state Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León’s district office in Los Angeles. 

The frustration was obvious in what people like Darryl Goodus had to say he waited in line outside the office, with quite a few of his staff members and clients, for his turn to speak his piece to the senator’s representative. He’s the director of adult day programs at Villa Esperanza Services in Pasadena, where he’s had to deal with staff turnover between 60 and 75 percent each year because his workers get paid just $9 or $9.50 an hour, even though many of the clients they help are medically fragile. It’s very difficult to attract and retain a quality staff with that sort of pay range. And staff turnover is frustrating and counterproductive for clients. 
  
The joy was clear in the faces of the developmental services clients who were there to advocate for themselves and their families. There was laughter and camaraderie as they waited patiently with their service providers to share their own stories with the senator’s staff member. 

Hope, of course, was what brought more than 200 people out to the rally. They want the senate president to hear their arguments for the Lanterman Coalition’s plea for a quick 10 percent hike in the state rates paid to regional centers and service providers — rates that have barely budged in two decades. That “emergency rate relief” would stop the bleeding of developmental services, so that quick 10 percent hike is what everyone at the rally is hoping for. (The Lanterman Coalition is also pushing for a total realignment of rates to make them sustainable over the long haul — but first things first.) 
  
Let’s hope their pleas are heard in Sacramento, where the Legislature’s special session to address health care and developmental services has produced precious little so far for the developmental community. 

So far in that session, six bills dealing with tobacco and e-cigarettes quickly passed the Senate and were sent to the Assembly — while the Senate bills dealing with developmental services lag behind. 

Do our legislators actually put a higher priority on tobacco and its regulation than they do on services for our most vulnerable fellow Californians? 
  
Assemblyman Rob Bonta’s ABX2-1 passed the Assembly Monday and was sent to the Senate. But it’s essentially a placeholder bill, stating in full: “It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation establishing funding sources and mechanisms in order to provide additional support for, and access to, Medi-Cal and developmental services.” 

That’s great, but good intentions are not enough to satisfy the people who flooded de Leon’s office today. 

They’re not going to be satisfied until they see some money.","Developmental clients, providers know what they need; is Legislature listening?: Opinion",News,San Bernardino County Sun,2015-09-01T23:22:05Z

	 Brandon’s tenure, ouster chronicled in recent book 

 
BY RACHEL LENZI 
BLADE SPORTS WRITER 


 
ANN ARBOR — During the course of researching his newest book, John U. Bacon found that while he knew the story of a fractured athletic department and its fractured football program, he didn’t know the depth of the story’s layers. 
 
Bacon found the same in previous books he has written about sports, particularly about college football and the Big Ten Conference. 
 
“Every time I write one of these books, 90 percent of it is surprising to me,” said Bacon, a former Detroit News reporter who has authored four books on college football. 
 
“In Three And Out , the big surprise was what heroes the players became. In Bo’s Lasting Lessons , it was how he thought through everything. In Fourth and Long , it was how the players and fans saw one side of the equation in college football and how the suits saw another.” 
 
In Endzone: The Rise, Fall, and Return of Michigan Football , his latest release, Bacon examines the fall and the resurrection of the University of Michigan athletic department and its football program, as well as the departure of former athletic director Dave Brandon. 
 
What he found in the process of researching and reporting Endzone was how college athletics can be turned into a commodity and how that can alienate its constituents. 
 
He also realized how much a marquee football program can affect an entire university such as Michigan. Football, Bacon explained, touches everything, and that there are a number of stakeholders in the football program who are also a part of the college community: student-athletes, coaches, alumni, fans, faculty, deans, provosts, regents, and even the president. 
 
Bacon also learned that while college athletics is big business, the purpose of that business cannot override the inherent values of college athletics. Because all of that happened at Michigan. 
 
“I’m not anti-corporation, not at all,” Bacon said. “But there are limits to that approach. You see those limits when you try to apply them to a nonprofit entity.” 
 
Since the book’s release Sept. 1, it debuted at No. 6 on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction list, and the tome is relevant at a time when the University of Texas’ traditionally heralded football program is struggling and its athletic administration is undergoing a major transition following the firing of athletic director Steve Patterson earlier this month. 
 
“There are parallels at other schools in the nation,” Bacon said, noting strife at schools such as Penn State and Oregon. 
 
“The temptation is there for every athletic department to run it more like a business. There’s no doubt that you need fundamentally sound business practices to run an athletic department well. You need serious accountants, attorneys, CFOs, but don’t confuse it as a business. You will alienate customers. The fans. That’s a fundamental difference.” 
 
Bacon also acknowledged concern that the book could potentially villainize Brandon or portray him as solely a two-dimensional character whose leadership style was abrasive and corporatized. 
 
But between testimonials from student-athletes such as former UM punter Will Hagerup, university regent Andrea Fischer Newman, and former administrative assistant Annette Howe, Bacon portrayed Brandon’s concern for student-athletes and his deep loyalty to the school where played football for Bo Schembechler and later served as a university regent. 
 
“He’s a human being, and some of my favorite passages showed him as a good person, some touching and poignant moments,” said Bacon, who noted that he has not heard from Brandon since the book’s release. “The last month of his tenure, we didn’t know it was going to be the last month of his tenure. He reached out to a lot of constituencies he’d ignored before, and that told me that all along, he was aware.” 
 
Yet Endzone  isn’t simply about how an athletic department went awry or how a football program tumbled from its spot as one of the nation’s titans. It’s also how the university community — the stakeholders — responded. 
 
“It’s a great prism to see how a university works,” Bacon said. “And it has a happy ending. Not just in getting Jim Harbaugh as the football coach, but how an institution self-corrects, with its constituencies declaring themselves and saying, ‘We need to fix this.’ 
 
“They stood up for values that have endured for a long time. Cooperation, transparency, and the truth.”

in the first round against Siphenathi Qampi.

The ministry said Kompolo then collapsed in the ring and was taken to Frere 
hospital, where he went into a coma. He died on Tuesday. The ministry didn't

07a209ed-78f5-4c4a-a66a-ba991b7bf470,"Masahiro Tanaka threw 31 pitches in a bullpen session Friday, and the New York Yankees right-hander said he thinks he can return to the rotation this season despite a strained right hamstring. 

Speaking through a translator, Tanaka said he was able to throw all his pitches with force and his hamstring is getting better each day — though he has not attempted any fielding drills yet. 

Tanaka and manager Joe Girardi both said they must wait to see how the pitcher feels Saturday before determining when he might start again. Girardi said he would like to slot in Tanaka against Boston early next week. 

Tanaka said he still feels discomfort in his leg, but ""it's definitely moving in the right direction."" 

New York scratched Tanaka from his scheduled start Wednesday in Toronto. He got hurt running to first base after bunting last Friday in an interleague game against the Mets at Citi Field. 

He pitched pretty well for another five innings, but an MRI the following day revealed a Grade 1 strain, the least severe. 

The Yankees went into Friday night's game against the Chicago White Sox trailing first-place Toronto by three games in the AL East. New York has a firm grip on the league's top wild-card spot. 

If healthy, Tanaka would seem the likely choice to start a win-or-go-home wild-card game Oct. 6. He is 12-7 with a 3.38 ERA in his second major league season after coming over from Japan.

65a429ca-2f2d-4b8a-bc84-672c8620ae81,"Romanian Premier Victor Ponta is surrounded by media as he exits the national anti-corruption prosecutors office where he was questioned in Bucharest, Romania. Romanian prosecutors on Thursday Sept. 17, 2015 formally indicted Prime Minister Victor Ponta on corruption charges, including tax evasion and money-laundering, and said he will be tried by the country’s top court. September 21, 2015 
The High Court for Cassation and Justice opened the case by discussing the legality of the indictment. Prime Minister Victor Ponta was not required to attend the session and did not appear. Ponta, who turned 43 on Sunday, is the first sitting prime minister to be indicted and have his assets seized. He denies wrongdoing and has refused to resign. 
 
""It's important that we have stability,"" Ponta told reporters Monday explaining why he did not want to step down. ""We must continue the government."" The ruling Social Democratic Party met Monday to discuss the developments and party chairman Liviu Dragnea said the party will continue to support Ponta, prime minister since May 2012. 
 
The opposition Liberal Party will file a motion of no-confidence against Ponta's government later Monday. Ponta's ally Dan Sova, who is on trial in the same case on charges of forging receipts, tax evasion and money laundering, appeared in court Monday. 
 
Prosecutors first named Ponta a suspect on June 5 and he was indicted in July on charges including tax evasion, money laundering, conflict of interest and making false statements while he was working as a lawyer in 2007 and 2008. At the time, Ponta was a lawmaker. 
 
Prosecutors say Ponta forged expense claims worth at least 181,000 lei ($47,000) from Sova's law firm. They say he pretended to work as a lawyer to justify getting money from the law firm. The funds were used to pay for two luxury apartments and the use of an SUV. 
 
After Ponta became prime minister he appointed Sova as a minister three times, which prosecutors say constituted a conflict of interest.

Three hours after  NJ Advance Media reported that the Rutgers AD addressed the football team after practice Monday to express her support, Hermann said she ""delivered a message about personal accountability and the responsibility to be caretakers of Rutgers football and everything it represents.'' 
 
""As the leader of the athletic department, I felt it was important to meet with the players to express my profound disappointment over recent issues involving the program, but at the same time make the team fully aware that they have my unwavering support,'' Hermann said in a statement released by her spokesman.

It marked Hermann's first public statement since Sept. 2 , when five football players were arrested for their alleged involvement in two separate crimes. She hasn't fielded questions from the media since before news surfaced that Flood was being investigated by the university for alleged improper contact with a professor. 
 
Hermann, who was criticized early on in the university-led investigation for her silence on the situation by Rutgers Athletics Hall of Famer Shaun O'Hara , didn't cite Flood by name in her support for the program.

fb2fff75-94d2-48cb-a1c9-12e129df7395,"OTTAWA -- After two weeks of sustained pressure to do more for the victims of conflict in Syria, Stephen Harper's government announced Saturday that Canada will provide $100 million in additional humanitarian assistance for the millions of Syrians crammed into refugee camps. 
 
A second announcement -- to speed up the tortuously slow process of resettling refugees in Canada -- is expected within a few days. 
 
Four million people have fled Syria since civil war broke out in 2011 but it wasn't until Sept. 2 that the crisis pierced Canadians' consciousness, when the image of a dead Syrian toddler on a Turkish beach shocked the world. 
 
The heart-rending photograph landed amid a federal election campaign in Canada and prompted charges that the Harper government has done little to ease the plight of Syrian refugees. 
 
Former Liberal prime minister Jean Chretien upped the ante Saturday in a open letter to several newspapers, in which he said Harper's ""cold-hearted reaction"" to the Syrian refugee crisis has ""shamed Canada in the eyes of Canadians and of the international community."" 
 
While the Conservatives insist the government has already done plenty, Harper signalled last week that more would be done. 
 
At a hastily assembled news conference Saturday, International Development Minister Christian Paradis said the federal government will match ""eligible"" donations made by Canadians between Sept. 12 and Dec. 31 to registered charities working to help the refugees -- up to a maximum of $100 million. 
 
The money will be used to help meet the ""basic needs"" of the refugees, including providing shelter, food, water, protection and emergency education, Paradis said. It will also be used to help poor countries through which some of the refugees are travelling. 
 
""The Syrian conflict is a tragedy of huge magnitude,"" Paradis said. 
 
""None of us can stand idle when we know the horrors that affect so many civilians caught in the Syrian conflict. The question that we've been hearing, loud and clear, from Canadians is: 'What can I do to help?'"" 
 
The $100 million is in addition to $503.5 million in funding that has already been allocated for humanitarian efforts in Syria and neighbouring countries since the beginning of Syria's civil war. 
 
The government says Canadian aid has already helped provide relief items to more than 3.25 million people in Syria, food assistance to 4.16 million people inside Syria, and clean water to 16.5 million people in Syria. 
 
Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne commended the federal move Saturday while announcing her province is pledging $10.5 million to help more refugees settle in Ontario and support international relief efforts. But she noted that Ontario can't bring in refugees on its own and called on the federal government to accelerate the resettlement process. 
 
Similarly, federal New Democrats and Liberals welcomed the new funding but urged immediate action to speed up the arrival of Syrian refugees in Canada. 
 
""We must not stop there. It is our duty to implement a concrete plan to help Syrian refugees now and over the years to come,"" Paul Dewar, the NDP's foreign affairs critic, said in a written statement. 
 
""I think it's time to dig a little deeper and move a little faster,"" said Liberal MP Adam Vaughan during a news conference Saturday. 
 
""It's time to live up to this country's proud, proud history of being a place of refuge, of safety. Canadians can do it but they need a partner in Ottawa."" 
 
Fewer than 2,500 Syrian refugees have so far been resettled in Canada. The government announced in January that it would accept 10,000 over three years and, since calling the election last month, Harper has promised to accept an additional 10,000 over the next four years. 
 
NDP leader Tom Mulcair has promised to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of this year and another 9,000 annually for the next four years. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau has vowed to bring in 25,000 Syrians by the end of the year. 
 
Paradis said the government is already deploying more officials to Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to accelerate the processing of refugees. While it continues to consider options to do more, he said it's important to ensure security screening is done. 
 
Jason Kenney, the former immigration minister, ruled out airlifting Syrian refugees. In an interview with CBC radio's The House, Kenney said it would be ""terribly imprudent"" to do minimal screening of refugees from a country rife with terrorists. 
 
Paradis also struck back at Chretien, saying the former prime minister's recent private meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""kind of questionable"" given that Putin has invaded Ukraine and is backing the brutal Al-Assad regime in Syria. 
 
Chris Friesen, president of the Canadian Immigrant Settlement Sector Alliance, said Saturday's announcement was a step in the right direction but still doesn't address the issue of speeding up resettlement of Syrian refugees. He said the top priority must be reuniting refugees who have family members already in Canada. 
 
""These people are desperate. They're watching this day in and day out from their living rooms, Skyping their families. They're getting vicarious traumatization, depression, anxiety,"" Friesen said. 
 
""They're completely helpless. They don't know where to turn.""

For all the changes happening in late-night comedy, and the new hosts taking the chairs of retired veterans like David Letterman and Jon Stewart, the genre remains one of television’s most homogenous fields, populated almost entirely by men. That’s a fact Samantha Bee notes in the official announcement for her new show Full Frontal, which debuts on TBS in January. With Chelsea Handler currently off the air (though prepping for a Netflix show) and The Grace Helbig Show in limbo, Bee will be the only female late-night host on the air. 

“Don’t watch my new show just because I’m a woman,” Bee jokes in the promo. “Watch because of my nuanced perspective on world events, my repartee with newsmakers across the ideological spectrum, and of course, these,” she says, lifting her skirt to reveal some comically large prosthetic testicles. It seems ridiculous that in 2015 a gag about needing a Y chromosome to host a late-night talk show would be so cutting, but that’s how slow change has been in coming to this particular school of television. 

Bee, of course, has the chops for late night, and is a much safer choice than TBS’s last hire, the stand-up comic Pete Holmes, whose show aired in the slot following Conan for 80 episodes from 2013-14. Holmes’s show was frequently brilliant and made a real effort to subvert the formulas of the talk show genre, but he was a largely unproven name in TV and sadly floundered in the ratings. Bee worked on The Daily Show for 12 years and became one of its best-known correspondents, and if she’s following Conan O’Brien (still unconfirmed for now), is more likely to mesh with his younger-skewing basic-cable audience. 

Still, it’s remarkable that Bee is the first female host to emerge in the great late-night shakeup. When David Letterman announced his retirement, CBS and Craig Ferguson also parted ways on The Late Late Show, leaving two big network openings that went to Stephen Colbert and James Corden. Colbert’s hiring was, in many ways, a no-brainer. Interviewed in The New York Times today about The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, CBS’s CEO, Les Moonves, said, “I know people were clamoring: ‘Well, why don’t they get a woman? Why don’t they get somebody diverse?’ All of which we considered.” But when he learned Colbert was available, he realized, “There’s not anything better than that.

“Too much of everyone's income goes to pay for higher taxes and health care,” said Fradella, 57, a certified family mediator in Florida. “Everything we taught our kids about how to budget and save is now ridiculous. 
 
“We have one child, and he may never be able to afford the taxes on our home which we plan to gift to him,” she added. 
 
More and more American adults agree. New research published by life insurance provider Haven Life shows just one in eight Americans believe the next generation will be more financially secure than themselves. Also, only 20% think the next generation will have a better quality of life — with many parents looking at their own financial difficulty as the reason for their pessimism. 
 
""For the Baby Boomer generation, pocket money from mom and dad was only part of their early childhood,” said Yaron Ben-Zvi, CEO of Haven Life. “Today's parents are increasingly prepared to worry about and provide for their children's financial well-being far into their adulthoods.” 
 
Paul Murray, president of PTM Wealth Management, said the next generation will have a tough time duplicating their parents' standard of living — even while their parents are not nearly as well off as their own parents.

 Gastonia, NC (PRWEB)  September 09, 2015  

On Thursday, September 10, 2015, the McIlveen Family Law Firm celebrates the inauguration of their new location in historic downtown Gastonia with a ribbon cutting ceremony and the introduction of the new McIlveen Charitable Foundation. 
 
“The focus of the McIlveen Charitable Foundation is literacy,” states Angela McIlveen, whose firm recently won a Community Impact Award for their service to the community. “We want our foundation to focus on the gift of reading and learning at an early age so they can carry that with them through life.” 
 
In order to jumpstart children’s learning for the new school year, the McIlveen Charitable Foundation will gift every child in attendance with at least one book collected from their book drive. This book drive is the first effort of the charitable foundation. 
 
Studies have shown that children in lower income households are exposed to fewer words compared to children in other households. Once they enter middle school, it is usually too late to catch up to other students. 
 
“One of the firm values is being a forever learner. A lot of us here developed our love for reading as children, and we want to pass on that gift to others,” McIlveen shares. “Our charitable efforts always focus on causes that are important to the employees, and education is definitely one of them. We love giving back to a community that has done so much for us as a business. Starting our own foundation was naturally the next step.” 
 
The ribbon cutting ceremony, open to the public, is scheduled to occur from 4:30 pm to 5:00 pm at 174 S. South Street, Gastonia, NC. There will be a reception after the ribbon cutting from 5:00pm to 7:00pm for McIlveen Family Law Firm clients and their families that will feature popcorn, cotton candy, snow cones, a bouncy house, and live entertainment from Frozen characters. Another private reception will also occur during this time. 
 
McIlveen Family Law Firm’s new head office is located on the third and fourth floors and rooftop of a charming four-story building in downtown Gastonia, where it utilizes an open space concept to promote productivity through accessibility. This open space design is not typical for a law firm, but is more reminiscent of a Silicon Valley company. 
 
The building houses a reception area, client conference rooms, a café with soda fountain, open workspace dedicated to the staff, and employee amenities such as a fitness center and nap room. 
 
Founded by Angela and Sean McIlveen, the McIlveen Family Law Firm ranked 13th in the small company category of Charlotte Business Journal’s Best Places to Work for 2014. Among the charities the firm has worked with in the past are the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, The Relatives, Project Halo, and Habitat for Humanity. 
 
Focused solely on North Carolina family law, the McIlveen Family Law Firm is fully committed to helping families from all over the state resolve complex legal matters on an extensive range of issues, including divorce, child custody and support, alimony, adoption, domestic violence, prenuptial agreements, and grandparent rights. 
 
The legal team at the McIlveen Family Law Firm is composed of experienced attorneys who work tirelessly and advocate aggressively for their clients to look out for their best interests and to ensure that their rights are always protected.

5b0ea001-aa78-464a-b535-42c83c180bbb,")  London, Greater London -- Dog Doo Good , a premium dog supplies brand, is offering a no-bag-split guarantee to its customers, in addition to Amazon’s 30 days guarantee . The guarantee is linked to the product's unique ‘Best Before' date printed on each bag. 
If the products are used before its stated Best Before date, in the extremely unlikely event of a bag breaking or splitting, even if over 30 days after purchase, a free product replacement or full refund will be offered. The company made the decision to advise customers on a date they should use their biodegradable dog waste bags by as all biodegradable materials naturally degrade much faster than standard plastic bags. Typically when a Dog Doo Good bag is discarded in soil in the presence of microorganisms, moisture and oxygen, it will achieve 60% biodegradation, decomposing into simple materials found in nature within 20 to 24 months. It degrades even faster (12 to 24 months) when disposed of in the presence of oxygen and UV light / heat. 

Dog Doo Good has partnered with epi, who provide the biodegradable agent TDPA® injected into their plastic doggy poo bags to give them their biodegradability. epi recommend using the product a certain number of months after their TDPA® agent has been added during the manufacturing of the bags. Dog Doo Good do stress that bags being used even a few months after this date should be perfectly fine, and still very unlikely to split. However they have included the Best-Before date so they can set a guarantee, a feature which company director Matthew Garrow-Fisher says is very important in this market. ""Biodegradable dog waste bags are a premium product in the market relative to standard plastic bags. Customers paying a premium demand security in the bags' strength. The number one concern when using any dog poo bags is that they do not split - no one wants dog's mess on their hands! By offering a rock-solid, no hassle money-back or product replacement guarantee, we give our customers peace of mind that this worst-case scenario never happens. However we are being responsible in providing a timeline when the customer should use the product by due to the naturally-degrading nature of the bags, to be extra careful in minimising all risks of bags splitting"". 

If a bag splits within 30 days, customers can contact Amazon who will coordinate a product replacement or refund. After 30 days, as long as the bags are within their Best-Before date (as printed on each bag), customers should contact Dog Dog Doo via the feedback section of its website to arrange a product replacement or full refund.

Overlooked, perhaps inevitably, amidst the hyperbole of collapse, destruction and loss of life, is the cost of the poor management of the asset, and the water resource, something that can be relatively easily fixed and where the failure to do so is less dramatic but no less costly. By GREG MILLS.

Fifty years ago the Kariba Dam was the centrepiece of collaboration of the Central African Federation. Built in just four years, it was opened by the Queen Mother in 1960 in front of a crowd of 3,000 onlookers, reported by British Pathé at the time, in black and white of course, ""as one of the wonders of the world"", an ""£80-million masterpiece of engineering skill"".

093b5162-5347-4de4-a09a-f33f30ddd2e7,"Ashmore Park VIllas in Carterton will feature houses like this. 
   
Wairarapa's fastest growing town is about to get another boost with a 74 house subdivision getting the green light. 

Ashmore Park Villas is to be located off Brooklyn Road in the southern section of town. 

The RJ Ker Contracting Ltd development is the latest in a string of housing subdivisions in Carterton which is boosting population numbers and broadening the rating base. 
    
Carterton mayor John Booth says this development is another sign that the district continues to be a magnet for commuters and retirees. 
   
Carterton mayor John Booth says this development is another sign that the district continues to be a magnet for commuters and retirees. 

""There's a real feel good factor about what's happening in Carterton. To have another development like this in the other end of town it is a real balancing thing for us,"" he says. 

He believes urban growth and the influx of new residents will benefit community and the council. 

""They are people that love to come and volunteer around the district. 

""If by broadening the rating base it can keep rates to affordable levels for other people in the district, then that's great,"" Booth says. 

The same developer behind Ashmore Park is also responsible for a 56 house subdivision, Villa Estate, in Armstrong Avenue. 

The new housing at Ashmore Park will have an occupation rate of around 1.5 people per house and they are aimed at over-50s market. 
 
The prices will range between $280,000 and $320,000 and will come with double and single garages. 

Leaders real estate agent Kelly McIsaac who is marketing the properties says Carterton is seen by buyers as a lovely place to relocate to as it has so much to offer. 

""Many people have told us that they love the community feel of the village and it reminds them of the neighbourhoods of old, when their neighbours were more like family,"" she says. 

Many of the buyers are from the Wellington area, particularly the Hutt, according to developer Robbie Ker. 

He estimates it will take three to four years to sell all the houses and then they may well start another venture in Carterton as it seems to be a town where people want to live and the council is easy to deal with. 

ROAD SMOOTHED FOR DEVELOPERS 

While developers complain that some councils can seem to be positively obstructive to their grand plans, Carterton District Council has come in for high praise for helping to make large subdivisions happen. 

Ker, the man behind several large housing developments in Wairarapa, says Carterton District Council has not only smoothed the road for his plans but given some degree of certainty around the likelihood of being able to go ahead. 

Ker says towns progress with projects by developers but they need to work well with councils. 

""For the last 25 years or so I have dealt with lots of local authorities and I have found the Carterton District Council the best - particularly over this case,"" he says. 

The mayor personally sat down with Ker, the real estate representatives and the CDC regulatory staff to nut out solutions to make the project happen. 

""They we just proactive, they were helpful and they were positive."" 

RJ Ker also built the Holdsworth Villas development in Masterton and Ker says the MDC were also good to deal with.

Scientists have identified genetic variants that generally only occur in relapsing cancers. 
 
Spotting them at diagnosis could forewarn doctors and help them deliver personalised treatments tailored to at-risk patients. 
 
Dr Lucy Yates, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute at Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, said: ""We have found that some of the genetic mutations that drive breast cancers that relapse are relatively uncommon amongst cancers that do not relapse at the point of primary diagnosis. 
 
""We believe that the differences we have seen reflect genetic differences that can predispose a cancer to return, combined with mutations acquired throughout the period from first diagnosis to the subsequent relapse. Some of these genetic alterations are potentially targetable with drugs."" 
 
About one in five breast cancers come back after treatment, appearing either at the same place as the original tumour or spreading to other parts of the body. 
 
The new research, to be presented at the 2015 European Cancer Congress in Vienna, shows that genetic factors driving recurring breast cancer are different from those responsible for non-returning tumours. 
   Promoted stories   
The Sanger team analysed DNA from tumour samples taken from 1,000 breast cancer patients. In 161 cases samples were taken from recurring tumours or spreading (metastatic) cancers. 
 
Cancer genes found in tumours sampled at first diagnosis were compared with those in relapsed cancers. 
 
Within an individual cancer, a wide range of accumulating factors influencing the function and activity of genes may affect tumour survival, the study found. 
 
Professor Peter Naredi, the European Cancer Organisation scientific co-chair of the Congress, said: ""Information such as that which Dr Yates will present is very important in the era of precision medicine.

5b0efbc9-3506-4561-920c-490b959d7476,"Mtwara. Chadema presidential candidate Edward Lowassa has promised residents of Mtwara that he would form a probe team on natural gas and oil contracts if he were elected to lead the country. 

Mr Lowassa said the probe team would involve local and foreign members who would seek to determine if the contracts were benefiting the people. 

However, Mr Lowassa had to apologize to the audience for arriving late at the public rally, saying he wanted to become president and work with the people to get rid of poverty and increase the number of meals per day. 

Earlier, he told the audience that education was one of his priorities and would ensure that it was improved and provided free of charge. He promised to improve teachers’ salaries from pre-schools to universities. 

He said no Tanzanian would fail to acquire education just because they didn’t have money. 

“Education will be provided free-of-charge from kindergarten to university, no one will fail to go to school because of lack of money and teachers will get their salaries on time,” pledged Lowassa. 

However, the opposition presidential candidate said that bodaboda riders, food vendors and hawkers, popularly known as machinga, will be friends of his government as he would ensure they are not expelled haphazardly from the streets. 

For his part, former Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye said there was no need for people to continue voting for CCM as it had already breached the contracts it had entered into with the people who he said had poor lives in spite of what they were promised. 

Mr Sumaye said it was surprising to see health was still a sensitive issue for pregnant women who were sometimes forced to carry with them medical kits while old people and children were not provided with free treatment. 

“There are many contracts that have been breached by CCM which promised to provide better lives for every Tanzanian. Health provision is also still poor and students sit on the floor when studying. There is no reason of voting for them ,” Mr Sumaye warned. 

However, Mr Sumaye requested CCM presidential candidate John Magufuli to join Chadema because the ruling party was not easy to sell to the people. He joked that Dr Magufuli had started using the Chadema logo, M4C.",Lowassa’s pledge on gas contracts,News,Tanzania Citizen,2015-09-22T06:25:10Z

The speed of browser development these days means you’re never more than a month or two from the next “major” release. But if you can’t wait that long, and you’re happy to sacrifice some stability and security in return for getting an early glance at new features, then this beta build of Google Chrome will satisfy most people. 
 
While the beta version is still not stable enough to be considered a final release for the masses, it has at least undergone a measure of testing by those Chrome users adventurous enough to install the bleeding-edge alpha, or Dev , build, so crashes and glitches are fewer and far between. 
 
It’s important to realise that updating to the beta build will overwrite your existing stable installation of Chrome, so you can’t run it side-by-side. But you will at least be automatically updated with the latest beta build, so as time goes on, Chrome becomes more stable before your current version migrates to a stable release and you jump to the next beta build. 
 
You can always jump back to the stable build by visiting the Release Channel page, but note you’ll only properly switch when a stable release newer than your beta build is released. If this is an issue, simply uninstall the beta and reinstall the stable version instead.

Brinkley, 30, is entering his seventh NFL season, and the Giants no doubt are attracted to his durability: He’s played 16 games four times in his career and 15 games in his other active season. He spent his first four years with the Vikings – he missed the 2011 season following hip surgery – played one year with the Cardinals and then returned to the Vikings, starting 11 games in 2014. His best season came in 2012, when he had 99 tackles for the Vikings.

The 6-foot-1, 255-pound Brinkley, Minnesota’s 2009 fifth-round draft pick out of South Carolina, was with the Cowboys in training camp and preseason after signing a two-year, $6.5 million contract.

d4d60a8b-bd81-44c9-9f32-aa2797a8f26c,"Milestone Systems XProtect allows 
UTA's video security system to 
expand to over 2,000 cameras  
Milestone Systems open platform networked video management software (VMS) is the leading-edge technology helping the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) to improve security dramatically, ensuring passengers a safer experience getting where they need to go. 

UTA employs 2,200 staff and moves approximately 120,000 passengers daily. It services Salt Lake Valley, Park City, Provo and Brigham City with 140 miles of rail, utilising transportation modes consisting of fixed route buses, commuter rail trains, light rail trains, paratransit buses and vanpool services. 

Previously, UTA’s video security system was limited by the capacities of its servers. In 2013, it reached the maximum of 500 cameras operating on three servers, which made it impossible to expand the system. UTA was building a new line out to the airport, and was eager to improve the surveillance to a much larger video system that would also be more efficient. 
 
Expanded camera range and centralised control system 

UTA enlisted Stone Security who helped determine that Milestone XProtect video management software best suited their needs. In 2010, Stone was named the Milestone Systems Installation Partner of the Year. In 2013, they were named Regional Partner of the Year and became the world’s first Milestone Diamond Reseller. As a Utah-based company, Stone also had the advantage of being familiar with UTA’s structure and requirements. 

As of early 2015 UTA has deployed over 1,000 cameras from a mix of vendors: Axis, Panasonic, IQEye and Digital Watchdog. The system runs on nine HP servers provided by BCDVideo. With all of this in place, UTA can expand to 2,000 cameras or more. The security cameras are accessible by dispatch, commuter and rail control centres and other authorised users. 
  Milestone marries two critical 
components for them: a 
centralised system and a lot 
of diversity in its deployment   
As an organisation committed to providing passengers with an optimal riding experience, switching to the Milestone system allowed UTA to put more cameras on platforms while centralising the control system. Milestone reduces the time spent by UTA employees attending to security issues without burdening riders. In addition, the significant improvement in video quality makes it easier to monitor and investigate incidents. 
 
Open platform and flexible storage give more options 
 
Brent Edmunds, co-founder and president of Stone Security, says: “Milestone marries two critical components for them: a centralised system and a lot of diversity in its deployment. The system supports many different kinds of cameras. We knew that UTA envisioned operating a robust security system that was both easy to operate and flexible.” 
 
The Milestone open platform allows a “best of breed” software integration model that ensures UTA’s system isn’t tied down to any one technology. It accommodates future growth and expansion. The flexible storage options also let UTA change its hardware options at any time. 
 
Saving money and lives 
 
The new technology has had an immediate positive financial impact for UTA. For example, gate arms frequently get damaged or broken off by vehicles. Prior to Milestone, these incidents would not only be costly but would often go unresolved. 
  Without our new video deployment, 
who knows how many man-hours 
might have been spent on these? 
We’re talking about lives in some of 
these cases - and you can’t put a 
price on that.   
“We were looking at two or three damaged gate arms a week,” says A. Lamount Worthy, Video Security Administrator, Utah Transit Authority. “It’s usually around a thousand dollars per gate to repair. The new camera deployments give us the means to recover those costs. Utah police can follow up and interview persons of interest, and attorneys can choose which of these cases to pursue. I would say that this year alone Milestone has already saved us tens of thousands of dollars.” 

Other savings are more difficult to quantify, but no less important. Worthy says the Milestone system is one of the key components in resolving several serious crimes in police investigations. 
 
Authenticated video as usable evidence 
 
Worthy knows that passengers put a premium on safe public transit. If something does happen, UTA has the means to officially capture the incident, and not just have to rely on someone’s iPhone. One of the most important features of the Milestone system is Evidence Lock, a function that secures select video recordings for investigations with authenticated time stamps. 
  
“The encryption and protection Milestone places on its exported video is a key factor of its ability to be presented in court,” Worthy says. “If I have to authenticate a video, I can say with full confidence that this footage has not been tampered with. Our cameras have also captured crimes that occurred off UTA property, and these videos were provided to police to assist their investigations. Without our new video deployment, who knows how many man-hours might have been spent on these? We’re talking about lives in some of these cases - and you can’t put a price on that.”",Milestone Systems XProtect video management system saves Utah Transit Authority time and money,News,SourceSecurity.com,2015-09-08T08:00:00Z

d34ccfab-72e5-4819-b76f-29e4c8c611cd,"By UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council on Thursday agreed to give a green light to launching an international investigation aimed at assigning blame for chemical weapon attacks in Syria, council diplomats said on Thursday.

The official start of the joint inquiry by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) was delayed due to objections by Russia, which had wanted to expand the investigation to include alleged attacks by Islamic State in neighboring Iraq, diplomats said.

The council's authorization comes in the form of a draft letter from Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. A 12 p.m. EDT (1600 GMT) deadline for council members to raise objections to the authorization lapsed without any complaints, council diplomats told Reuters.

One diplomat said Churkin was due to sign the response letter shortly.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, U.N. diplomats said Iraq opposed having the mandate of the Syria investigation broadened to include its territory. Russia had raised other ""technical"" questions about the inquiry.

The Russian queries, one of which related to the investigation's financing mechanism, were clarified by Ban in a Sept. 9 letter, which said a trust fund would be established.

Several council diplomats said Moscow was concerned the inquiry could end up confirming allegations by Western nations and rebels that the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has repeatedly used chemical weapons, including deadly sarin and, more recently, chlorine.

Western governments hope the U.N.-OPCW investigation will assign blame to specific individuals that could be used someday to prosecute members of the Syrian government for war crimes. 

But prospects for accountability appear remote. Russia and China have blocked for referral of the Syrian conflict to International Criminal Court.

Syria's government and rebels have denied using chemical weapons.

Western powers say Syria's government has been responsible for chemical attacks, including chlorine attacks. The Syrian government and Russia, a strong backer of Assad, accuse rebel forces of using poison gas.

Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 in an effort to avert U.S. military strikes threatened over a sarin gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians. The OPCW has since found chlorine has been ""systematically and repeatedly"" used as a weapon, though it is not mandated to lay blame.

A separate U.N. investigation had previously determined that sarin gas was used repeatedly in Syria to deadly effect, but that inquiry was also barred from assigning blame.

7fc3d32d-268b-49a3-ae87-27e778f9251c,"London mayor Boris Johnson said it was a ""no brainer"" to turn down the opportunity for London to host the start of the Tour de France in 2017. 

The cycling enthusiast said it was ""entirely my call"" to pull out of the event, believing the £35 million cost could be better spent.

Transport for London (TfL) announced yesterday that it would not host the Tour de France Grand Depart because it did not represent value for money.

He said: ""I had to take a very tough decision, obviously painful. In an ideal world, you know me, my policy is to have your cake and eat it.

""The difficulty was we had to make a choice. £35 million is an awful lot to spend on a one off event when you could put that money in to long term projects.

""What people really want is safer cycling lanes.""

He added: ""For me it was a no brainer.""

He believes ""most people"" would accept the cost of the race was too much, but denied it marked the end of big sporting events in London.

Asked why London made the initial bid for the event only to later pull out, he said: ""You've got to make some tough choices.""

The capital was asked to host the start of the world's most prestigious cycling race 10 years on from its hugely successful staging of the tour and three years after hosting a stage finish of the 2014 edition which started in Leeds.

Tour organisers Amaury Sports Organisation and bidding regions or cities engage in a courtship and Transport for London spurning advances could impact on when the race will next take place in the UK.

Scottish authorities are still in discussions, although logistics make such a bid challenging, while Manchester is understood to no longer be in the running.

There is no doubt ASO wishes to exploit Britain's affinity for cycling, but it is also keen to take advantage of the sport's rejuvenation in Germany.

The man who brought the Tour to Yorkshire would welcome a return, but accepts it is more realistic later in the decade.

Sir Gary Verity, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, said: ""The Tour de France, in its 112-year history, has never gone back to anywhere as quickly as that.""

Despite admitting that the not-for-profit organisation suffered a loss on its investment in the race, he said Yorkshire as a whole had benefited.

He said: ""From our point of view, it was tremendous value for money last year. The return on investment was either between five or six times, which is a pretty good return on investment I think in anybody's books and the long-term legacy benefits for us of hosting the Tour de France are still being seen.""

Announcing the decision to decline hosting duties in 2017, Leon Daniels, managing director of surface transport at TfL, yesterday said the return of the Tour was always ""subject to funding"".

Olympic gold medallist Chris Boardman appeared to sympathise with Mr Johnson's decision to save the money.

He tweeted: ""Don't know the details but if I had to choose, I'd spend it on infrastructure as well.

""That said, why bid in the first place?""

998d3d1d-452f-411d-b7b5-1c342c89e5d4,"VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/21/15 -- Otterburn Resources Corp. (""Otterburn"" or ""the Company"") (TSX VENTURE: OBN) is pleased to announce that K92 International Holdings Inc (""K92"") has informed the Company that the applications for renewal of exploration licenses (""EL"") 470, 693 and 1341 have been approved by the Mineral Regulatory Authority (""MRA"") of Papua New Guinea. Otterburn, as previously disclosed, intends to purchase 100% of the shares of K92 in a share purchase agreement. 

EL's 470 and 693 both cover an area of 95 square kilometers and host many known large lode gold systems found outside of the ML 150. The extension of these exploration licenses is good until February 05, 2017. EL 1341 covers an area of 248.8 square kilometers and a number of prospective porphyry copper-gold targets. EL 1341 has been renewed for a period to June 21, 2016. K92 has the exclusive right to renew these ELs in future provided the terms of the exploration license including exploration expenditures are performed. 

While the core focus of K92 is on Mining License 150 (""ML 150""), which was recently renewed for 10 years from June 14, 2014; the 438.8 sq km exploration package hosts multiple targets including areas prospective for high grade intrusive gold veins such as found within ML 150 and other areas prospective for porphyry copper-gold mineralization which was the focus of Barrick Gold's past regional work in the area. 

Further, with regards to the exploration potential at Kainantu, it is stated within the Independent Technical Report, Resource Estimate and Summary of Mining Facilities, Kainantu Project, Papua New Guinea (Nolidan Mineral Consultants, Author Anthony Woodward, BSc Hons., M.Sc., MAIG, May 1st, 2015), ""The Kainantu project is located in a recognized copper-gold province, as evidenced by the underlying geology and presence of nearby major projects operated by global majors Barrick, Newcrest and Harmony. Nolidan concludes that based on a review of historical exploration and the identified mineralization within the Kainantu Project package there remain a significant number of major untested and early stage targets. Within ML150 are the Kora lodes which are strongly mineralized at the limit of drilling and open and in all directions, as well as the Judd, Karempe and other unnamed mineralized lodes parallel to defined resources which have economically attractive grade in surface and/or drill samples from very limited work to date. Outside the ML there are continuations of the lodes listed above, as well as the strongly mineralized Mati, Mesoan, Arakompa and Maniape lodes proximal to the mining lease. A porphyry Cu-Au target is evident at shallow depth in the A1/Tempe/Tankuanan area to the southeast of ML150. Further away there is substantial mineralization at theAifunka and Kathnel deposits on EL1341 in a separate mineralization centre. Nolidan notes that Barrick originally purchased the Kainantu Project for the porphyry Cu-Au potential and internal reports rank the project very highly on a global scale. The decision to divest the project was made for corporate rationalisation reasons based on global competition for exploration expenditure rather than geological prospectivity reasons. This combined with the challenging land access meant that field work and drilling was not optimally conducted (e.g. at the A1 area). Within the four EL's surrounding the mine area there are numerous high quality porphyry and epithermal Cu-Au prospects which were not available for land access until late in Barrick's tenure. It is the view of Nolidan that all exploration targets in the Project remain untested or under-tested by modern exploration."" 

To view accompanying map, please click on the following link: http://media3.marketwire.com/docs/OBN0921.jpg 

K92 technical advisor Douglas Kirwin, commented; ""Because of the extensive geochemical programs and magnetic surveys previously conducted by Barrick, a number of highly prospective untested porphyry copper-gold targets are already defined as illustrated in the above figure. With limited additional surface work several of these may be fast tracked for first phase drilling. The9 sq km high-sulphidation lithocap and associated enargite-bearing breccias at Headwaters is a particularly exciting target. The Yompassa region in the southern part of the licenses comprises several highly significant large gold-copper geochemical anomalies which were virtually unexplored by Barrick."" 

As to work within the ML 150 area, K92 currently has approximately 70 local staff onsite. The number of staff will increase as the company moves from the current transitional stage to project ramp up. The infrastructure at the Kainantu project, in addition to the underground mine development, includes a mill processing facility, staff housing equipped for 350 people, multiple modern offices and storage facilities, a life of mine tailings pond and office space with information technology systems in place. The site has a dedicated power line from the nearby Yonki hydro electric energy facility and is accessible via a paved road. 

The initial resource estimate for the Kora and Irumafimpa deposits, situated within ML 150, is 1.84 M inferred oz. at 11.6 g/t Au eq. and 240,000 indicated oz. at 13.3 g/t Au eq (Independent Technical Report, Resource Estimate and Summary of Mining Facilities, Kainantu Project, Papua New Guinea, Nolidan Mineral Consultants, Author Anthony Woodward, BSc Hons., M.Sc., MAIG, May 1st, 2015). This mineral resource estimate is based on 78,935 metres of drilling from 767 holes and 18,312 metres of assayed intervals across all lodes. Kora remains open in all directions and strongly mineralized at the extent of drilling.

2d0aa745-ddf8-4550-9342-7a690d0d3016,"There is a stunning lack of new banks entering the market. 

Many community banks cite regulation as the main reason to increase fees. 

The number of very small community banks is declining the fastest due to Dodd-Frank. 

In the first GOP primary debate, Marco Rubio said something that attracted my attention. He said that Dodd-Frank and related regulation has hurt small banks. Because this is perhaps the opposite of what Washington is trying to accomplish, and the conventional view among investors is that regulation hurts large financial institutions, this prompted me to do further research. 

Evidence in FDIC data 

I started by looking into data by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The FDIC keeps track of the number of commercial banks that provide FDIC insurance and shares a lot of useful data on its website. The table below shows the number of institutions reporting to the FDIC. 

(click to enlarge) 

Source: FDIC 

Note how the number of commercial banks falls. Their numbers have been declining since the '80s, but the speed is increasing. An important cause behind the more rapid decline is the lack of new banks. Of course, the financial crisis could be the cause behind the low number of new banks. However, if that was the only cause, it should be picking up by now. Instead, we have seen new the number of new banks being set-up grind to a halt. The number of mergers is also up, to 3.9 mergers for every 100 existing banks over 2013-2014, compared to an average of 3.7 from 2004-2008. The number is rising as well. 

2011, the first full year after Dodd-Frank, has been the first year to see zero new banking charters since the creation of the FDIC in 1933. Also, there was a banking crisis in the late '80s that saw even more failures than during the financial crisis and yet the number of new charters never dropped below 40 for any year in the '80s or '90s. The chart below further illustrates the situation in the 1980s, and early 1990s. The fraction of unprofitable small banks was as high then and the situation lasted longer than the 2008 crisis. It must be noted, however, that the profitability of large banks recovered very fast this time, especially when compared to small banks. 

(click to enlarge) 

Source: FDIC. Financial institutions are grouped by size. 

Perhaps the number of new banks does not tell the whole story. Maybe it is the financial crisis that made the banking trade unpopular. For getting a better view, I added the graph below which shows the efficiency ratio 

(click to enlarge) 

Source: FDIC. Financial institutions are grouped by size. 

As the graph shows, large banks are almost back at their pre-2008 efficiency ratio, while smaller institutions are 5%-10% above what used to be normal for them. 

Mercatus center survey 

The FDIC data may be convincing, but still does not prove a causal relation between regulation and a supposed disadvantaged position of small banks. The Mercatus Center regularly conducts a small bank survey among 200 small banks (mostly community banks) of which they bundled the results in a working paper on how regulation affects small banks. 

The following is an excerpt from the abstract of the paper: 

""A large majority of respondents viewed Dodd-Frank as more burdensome than the Bank Secrecy Act, and the participating banks reported substantially increased compliance costs in the wake of new regulations."" 

This is fully consistent with the worsened efficiency ratio after the financial crisis. It may be no surprise that 25% of the banks surveyed are contemplating mergers to gain sufficient scale. They say they are most concerned about the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and the new mortgage rules. 

The same study says that while some banks have already increased their fees, many banks expect to increase their fees to compensate for the increased regulatory costs. 

Lux and Greene (2015) study 

The study above still not properly compared the state of small versus large banks. A study by the Harvard Kennedy School took a look at the impact on market shares of small and large institutions. In the introduction it says: ""Our findings appear to validate concerns that an increasingly complex and uncoordinated regulatory system has created an uneven regulatory playing field that is accelerating consolidation for the wrong reasons."" They found that the market share of small banks declined twice as fast after July 2010 when Dodd-Frank was passed. The graphs below should provide more clarification.

Source: The State and Fate of Community Banking 

The goal of Dodd-Frank was to end 'too big to fail'; however, it mostly increased the size of banks and is thus another piece of failed regulation. It did succeed at keeping down the size of the top 5 banks, but that may well be the result of extreme capital requirements for global systemically important banks by the Federal Reserve. I already touched on the capital regulations for the largest banks in this article. 

Bottom line 

If you own a lot of large-cap banking stocks and are not happy with how Obama runs your country, console yourself with the thought that at least one of his policies is making you money. Do take this into account when considering to invest in large (non-GSIB) banks - they have an attractive growth profile now.

e08ff4dd-a7d7-473a-8702-afcba87b05ad,"OTTAWA - Reeling from low oil prices, Canada fell into a recession in the first half of the year, government data confirmed Tuesday, putting Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper on the defensive in the run-up to October elections. 
 
The Canadian economy slipped into recession in the first half of 2015, adding to fears about the health of the global economy 

According to Statistics Canada, the economy contracted 0.5 percent in the second quarter after retreating 0.8 percent in the previous three months. 

It is Canada's second recession in seven years and it is the only Group of Seven nation in economic retreat. The figures are the weakest since the 2008 global financial crisis. 

The data reflects fears about the health of the global economy as more gloomy evidence emerged of a slowdown in China, a main engine of growth worldwide. 

Harper, whose Tories are trailing their rivals in opinion polls ahead of the October 19 election, blamed the overseas turmoil for Canada's woes, and emphasized an expansion in the economy in June. 

""We are living, once again, in a time of ongoing global economic instability,"" Harper said. 

""Obviously there has been challenges, particularly in the energy and some commodity sectors because of falling prices. But the fact of the matter is over 80 percent of the Canadian economy has been growing."" 

Canada, the world's fifth-largest oil producer, has been hit particularly hard by the halving of world oil prices from above $100 last year. 

In the second quarter, its mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction sector posted a ""notable decrease"" for a second consecutive quarter, said the government statistical agency. 

Analysts said the damage however could be limited. 

""Despite the weak start to the year, there is good reason to believe that the worst is over,"" said TD economist Brian DePratto. 

DePratto cited the sharp increase in GDP in June, ""providing positive momentum to start the second half of the year."" He predicted a ""sharp rebound"" in the third quarter with growth reaching 2.5 percent by year's end. 

- Harper under fire - 

On the campaign trail, where the economy has dominated the debate, opposition parties pounced on the grim data, urging voters to send the Tories packing. 

""Under Stephen Harper, this has been Canada's lost decade,"" leftist New Democratic Party candidate Andrew Thomson told a press conference in Ottawa. 

""Ten years of job losses, continued crumbling of infrastructure, tax breaks for the wealthy and a situation where the middle class continues to struggle to get ahead, 150 billion dollars in new debt and two recessions -- people are telling us they have had enough."" 

Thomson -- whose critiques were echoed by the Liberals -- said the Conservatives' stewardship of the economy has been a failure. 

""We need to bring change to Ottawa,"" he said. 

Harper has insisted that, oil aside, the rest of the economy is doing well, although the figures point to broad declines in a third of sectors. 

At a steel plant in Hamilton, Ontario, he urged voters to support his party's leadership, saying he had ""the proven experience to keep us safe and keep our economy moving forward."" 

- Business investment down - 

In the second quarter, business outlays for machinery and equipment, communications and audio and video equipment, furniture, fixtures and prefabricated structures, and intellectual property products fell. 

New housing construction decreased, but this was mitigated by an increase in renovations and strong resale activity, according to Statistics Canada. 

Canadians also bought more cars and trucks, insurance and financial services, as well as food, beverages and accommodation services in the period. 

Overall, exports edged up 0.1 percent after decreasing 0.3 percent in the first quarter. Imports declined 0.4 percent.",Canada officially enters recession,News,Bangkok Post,2015-09-01T18:14:50Z
bea5a1f4-ac61-4fa3-82eb-f75ccb871978,"Accra, Sept. 17, GNA - Ghanaian motorists continue to enjoy an unprecedented petroleum prices surpluses since the government through the National Petroleum Authority (NPA) started the partial deregulation regime on June 16.

At the seventh consecutive price review, Oil Marketing Companies have again reduced the prices of petroleum products attributed mainly to appreciation of the cedi against other major currencies and the fall in the world oil prices.

The retail prices of petroleum products at Filling Stations has fallen from GH¢ 3.47 per litre for petrol and GH¢ 3.37 per litre for diesel as quoted on June 16 to GH¢ 2.980 per litre for super and GH¢ 2.880 per litre for diesel at the September 16 price review.

A Ghana News Agency team monitoring the fortnight price review in accordance with the petroleum deregulation region revealed that Ghana Oil Company is quoting GH¢ 2.929 per litre for super and GH¢ 2.829 per litre for diesel.

Universal Oil Company Limited is quoting GH¢ 2.939 per litre for super and GH¢ 2.826 for diesel; Engen Ghana Limited has pegged the price at GH¢ 2.950 per litre for super and GH¢ 2.850 for diesel whilst Shell Ghana Limited is selling at GH¢ 2.950 per litre for super and GH¢ 2.860 for diesel.

Allied Oil Company Limited has also pegged the price at GH¢ 2.960 per litre for super and GH¢ 2.850 per litre for diesel, and Total Ghana Limited is quoting GH¢ 2.980 per litre for super and GH¢ 2.880 per litre for diesel.

The prices review of petroleum products is in conformity with the de-regulation of petroleum products.

The NPA has explained that the increment or decrease of petroleum prices is no longer the preserve of the government but is determined by market forces that take into consideration the international price of crude oil, the foreign exchange rate, the fall or rise of the cedi, import duties, taxes and other factors.

According to the NPA it has put in place mechanism to sanctions on Bulk Distribution Companies (BDCs) and OMCs that would go beyond the average price indicated.

In the event that the quality of products is found to have been compromised, it would result in the withdrawal of licences after a third warning.

Meanwhile Dr Raziel Obeng-Okon, a Chartered Licensed International Financial Analyst explained to the GNA that the competition among the BDCs and OMCs has led to reduction in margins and therefore lower prices for final consumers of petroleum products.

He said some vehicle owners and commercial drivers now shop around to buy from OMCs with the lowest prices.

Dr Obeng-Okon noted that prior to deregulation, the OMCs used to blame the NPA for the reduction of margins but the deregulation regime has witnessed lower margins by some OMCs than the pricing regime under the NPA before deregulation.

He said the preceding weeks to the deregulation the NPA reduced the total retail margins from more than 9.00 per cent in April to about 8.00 per cent just before the deregulation.He noted that currently, some OMCs are making just about 7.00 per cent or less total margin on the ex-pump price to drive volumes.

He said margins are shrinking among the OMCs because buyers have become so sensitive to price than quality.

Dr Obeng-Okon who is also an Economic/Investment Management Consultant said OMCs could no longer blame the NPA for the determination of total retail margins even in the face of increasing ex-pump price.

He said competition and the forces of demand and supply are now the main determinant of the price mechanism.

'Liquidity positions of the OMCs have become very tight as most of them now have a shorter working capital cycle because the BDCs now require earlier payment than before,' he said.

Dr Obeng-Okon noted that some OMCs had to put a stop on using the BDCs monies to fund the construction of service station because working capital has become very essential for their survival.

'To make matters worse for the OMCs, the Special Petroleum Tax (SPT) and OMCs' Guarantees to Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), Customs Division have become a further drain on the liquidity of the OMCs.

'Usually, OMCs are expected to pay the 17.5 per cent SPT on their loadings within two weeks whether or not they have sold the products. Sometimes, taxes are paid on unsold products and this is very worrying,' he said.

Dr Obeng-Okon noted however that the payment of SPT also impacts negatively on the guarantee ceilings of OMCs with Customs. 'The GRA needs to be sensitive to the plight of the OMCs on the flexibility of enforcing the guarantees before loadings if the deregulation is to be successful'.

He said the deregulation is beneficial to government because it ensures the paying of the outstanding debt of government to the BDCs as well as ensure that government no longer subsidises the cost of fuel.

Under the deregulation, the BDCs have been successful in convincing government and the NPA to remove the Price Stabilisation Margins from the pricing formula.

He explained that the deregulation has also improved the liquidity position of the BDCs through the reduction of credit days for the OMCs.

Dr Obeng-Okon said competition among the BDCs has reduced the ex-refinery prices for the OMCs and thus lower prices for the final consumer.

The regulator needs to monitor the quality of petroleum products as consumers shift their attention to just the price.

One of the country's best-known hotels - the five-star Westbury off Dublin's Grafton Street - has claimed that construction of a five-storey development on a Nama-controlled site beside its premises will disturb its well-heeled guests and could prejudice investment at the hotel. Declan Taite of Duff & Phelps acts as receiver of Fincon Developments, which applied for permission last year to demolish the large, three-storey Chatham House and to replace it with a five-storey premises containing retail space, a restaurant and 14 apartments.

Chatham House is currently home to a number of retailers and offices, including The Great Outdoors and the head office of struggling mining firm Kenmare Resources.

It bounds a number of narrow streets off Grafton Street, one of which is directly adjacent to the Westbury, on Balfe Street.

The Westbury Hotel is part of the Doyle Collection that also owns hotels in Cork, London, Bristol and Washington. Hoteliers John and Bernie Gallagher have a major stake in the business.

Planners for the Westbury Hotel told Dublin City Council that they did not believe a five-storey building is appropriate for the location. They said that a planned communal space at the top of the new building could have a ""serious adverse effect"" on its guests if late-night noise becomes an issue.

The hotel's planners also said that a ""wind tunnel effect"" could be created on Balfe Street by the new building, which could impact the hotel's main entrance. The Westbury has been engaged with the council to ""enliven"" the hotel's frontage. The hotel is also concerned that even a convenience shop or a takeaway in the new building would ""adversely affect the hotel and its associated high-end shop units, art galleries and quality restaurants"".

But the council has granted permission for the development, prompting the Westbury to launch an appeal to An Bord Pleanala.

It has just told the agency that €17m has been invested in the Westbury over the past decade.

Unless stringent mitigation measures are imposed in relation to the redevelopment, the hotel warns that there could be ""significant operational impacts"" on the premises, which in turn could impact visitor numbers and ""prejudice the on-going investment in the hotel which is necessary to maintain its five-star status"".

An Bord Pleanala is due to make a decision in the case by the start of January.

5fe8bbb2-bd33-48ed-91c3-00a8f28336fc,"Port Kembla steelworkers are facing a do-or-die decision. 

Community steeled to save its own

Five facts you didn't know about Port Kembla steelworks.

At 780 hectares, it is big enough to have its own postcode, but it doesn't.

It has four railways stations servicing the steelmaking plant.

It once employed more than 22,000 workers. Now there are only 5000.

It had such beautiful gardens that it used to hold garden tours .

It has its own rules and regulations. Pedestrians are expected to give way to vehicles at crossings, and, for the sake of safety, no talking is allowed on any stairs. So much for gossip.

Wollongong's Chris Wilkins, 65, was a pioneer at Port Kembla steelworks in the early 1970s, and it wasn't only because of her radical decision to wear beige pants instead of a mini skirt.

Back then, global steel production was rising, demand was healthy, and the mill was humming, employing nearly 22,000 steelmakers in Port Kembla like Mrs Wilkins and 12,000 in the now closed BHP plant in Newcastle.

Her beige pants rebellion could have been why she was picked to work with the men, she said touring the plant this week. The young trainee metallurgist went on to become a process controller, and later the Southern Hemisphere's first female melter in the then new Basic Oxygen Steelmaking Plant. Her job included eyeballing the batches of steel that reach 1400 Celsius degrees to see what additives were needed, a job that is now done by a computerised lab.

""It was groundbreaking to put a woman to work on a steelmaking plant,"" said Wilkins, who left to have children and fulfil her mother's dream that she become a piano teacher.

Like anyone who lives in the Gong, the steelworks has been part of her DNA and her family and friends' livelihood for generations, including her dad who worked there as a locomotive driver.

The first heat of local steel was made in 1900, using Illawarra coal. Since then the works have been owned by a who's who of Australian industry from Australian Iron and Steel, to BHP and now BlueScope Steel, which bought the plant in 2002.

These days, the once-grand empire spanning 780 hectares – so large it is serviced by four railway stations – runs on the smell of an oily rag, 5000 workers and technology. The showcase gardens of the past are full of dandelions, and the murals depicting men busy at work are faded and covered with red dust.

""I can't imagine it becoming derelict. It would be an absolute tragedy,"" said Wilkins. ""It would be just like a house of cards, and [the end of] all the industries that rely on the steelworks.""

But with steel prices at record lows, and a glut of foreign steel threatening the remnants of the Australian industry, the workers and owners of the steelworks are facing a do-or-die decision.

The global economy for steel is ""weak, anemic and sluggish,"" UBS analyst Daniel Morgan told the industry's annual conference in Sydney this week. Everyone kept hoping it would improve, and saying it would, but it hadn't, and there didn't seem much cause for optimism.

Because of overproduction by China, cheaper Chinese steel is flooding into export markets. ""Every steel market in the world is talking about protection. You are not alone,"" said Morgan.

The Australian Steel Institute, Wollongong citizens, the local labour council and the union are calling for emergency tariffs, accelerated anti-dumping measures or a buy-Australian policy to protect what's left of Australia's steel industry, arguing that it is essential to structural security.

And they are suspicious of the CEO of BlueScope Steel Paul O'Malley who does not favour the introduction of emergency tariffs. ""It may sound good, it may make people feel good, but it would be one of the quickest ways to get the steelworks shut if I pursued that,"" he said.

If BlueScope pursued emergency tariffs, it would likely encourage other countries to retaliate with tariffs that would affect the plant's own exports. Of its 2.6 million tonnes production, 600,000 tonnes are exported.

Instead, BlueScope has issued an ultimatum to the Port Kembla steelworks: cut costs or close.

""Success is about being low cost. It is the only way we can justify having a commodity business,"" said O'Malley.

Option A, as it is called, is to cut $200 million a year from the cost of converting iron ore into steel. This will likely cost 500 jobs.

Option B is the least palatable to everyone. Shutter the entire steelworking operations and lose 5000 jobs, including about 1500 contractors.

A full closure would result in a $3.3 billion loss to the local economy, and a total loss of around 10,000 jobs directly and indirectly, according to an Australian Workers Union analysis. It would have a big impact on the region's already high unemployment rate of 8.5 per cent. For older workers – most BlueScope steelworkers are in their 40s and average 20 years' service – the outlook for finding other work is much grimmer than the last major layoff in 2011. At least then, the mining boom offered some workers a way out.

BlueScope recorded a profit this year for the first time in seven years, mostly from products like ColorBond. But its steelmaking operations are operating at a $200 million annual loss.

Commentators suggested BlueScope's balance sheet would improve if it closed, but O'Malley told the AIS' annual meeting that there was a better alternative. ""If we can get $200 million costs out, we can be cost competitive for imported (steel),"" he said. ""We get to maintain the fabric of the Illawarra community, and we get to maintain the steelworks so that if steel margins improve we get the upside on that,"" he said.

After weeks of negotiation with union, there has been some progress. ""We have about 50 per cent in the bag,"" he said.

The company has asked the state government to waive about $33 million in payroll taxes and other imposts. BlueScope paid $28 million in payroll taxes last year, although it operated at a loss.

O'Malley puts the choice in stark terms. Either NSW gets a steel industry and doesn't receive payroll taxes, or it loses the steel industry and gets payroll tax on what's left.

As much as $105 million is expected to flow from sourcing cheaper iron ore and other supplies, renegotiating service contracts, changes in administration, and operational efficiencies.

But the most controversial is the $50 million to $60 million that will flow from a combination of the 500 job losses and other efficiencies that will see the removal of some workers' entitlements and loadings.

Like any workplace going through redundancy, morale has dropped. While the union has pledged to work with the company to reduce costs, it wants to ensure that the blue-collar workers aren't the only ones to feel the pain.

Long-term union rep Wayne Phillips, the Port Kembla Branch secretary, said at a meeting of the metal coatings division, where 48 jobs are expected to go, 40 workers put up their hand when asked if they wanted to leave.

""Management constantly picks at them,"" he said. While the wages had been ""decent,"" proposed changes would affect some of the conditions that workers relied upon.

The company has already proposed scrapping the practice of averaging out overtime, removing hot seat changeover payments and has suggested that workers (not Bluescope) pay to have contaminated clothing laundered.

To the union many of these payments were hard won and well deserved, but to O'Malley they represent a legacy of practices that have constrained efficiency.

"" If we don't get the costs out there's no business. If they don't buy into change, they're effectively telling us they'd prefer to see 5000 (jobs) go rather than 500. People have been paid for hours they don't work, and lots of terms and conditions that have been built into awards over time. If they are to continue, there won't be a steelworks.""

""What we are saying is that if we can create one team, we can save the steelworks. But the class warfare has got to disappear.""

Alex Varga, 46, is a second-generation steelworker and a father of five. He plans to stay on.

He has been told that as many as 30 of the 40 jobs in the slab handling unit where he works would be scrapped to be replaced by two shifts of five.

""I am happy there,"" he said. ""I am worried about my job security, and the bigger picture... 500 is a lot but it is better than losing thousands en masse.""

About Resverlogix

Resverlogix is developing apabetalone (RVX-208), a first-in-class, small molecule that is a selective BET bromodomain inhibitor. BET bromodomain inhibition is an epigenetic mechanism that can regulate disease-causing genes. Apabetalone is the first and only BET inhibitor selective for the second bromodomain (BD2) within the BET protein called BRD4. This selective inhibition of apabetalone on BD2 produces a specific set of biological effects with potentially important benefits for patients with diseases such as high-risk cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), Alzheimer's disease, peripheral artery disease, and chronic kidney disease while maintaining an excellent safety profile. Apabetalone is the only selective BET bromodomain inhibitor in human clinical trials. Resverlogix's Phase 3 clinical trial BETonMACE in high-risk CVD patients with DM and low HDL is planned to commence in the fall of 2015. Resverlogix's common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: RVX). For further information please visit www.resverlogix.com.

f7dbbde9-7933-4cf0-b064-9d5eaa9a4aaa,"Former tennis star James Blake's run-in with New York police -- in which an officer blindsided him, threw him down on a Manhattan sidewalk, then pulled him up in handcuffs -- lasted all of 10 to 15 minutes. A difficult time, no doubt, but nonetheless a limited one. 
 
On Monday, he expressed hopes that the aftermath of that ordeal would last much longer. 

Blake talked to reporters after meeting with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and police Commissioner William Bratton not just about that incident earlier this month, but about what the city and police department generally can do to prevent the same thing from happening to others. 

""We're not looking for a quick lawsuit, we're not looking for anything that's going to be a quick and easy solution,"" he said. ""We're looking for a lasting, positive impact on the city and on the police force."" 

What specific changes might come out of this? Blake didn't offer details, nor did city officials. 

""Right now, we still just have pretty broad strokes but on a similar page,"" Blake said. ""... The process will sort itself out very quickly ... I'm confident of that."" 

Blake: 'Trying to react in a positive manner' 

Once ranked No. 4 in the world, Blake was staying in the Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan on September 9 -- while the U.S. Open, across town, was in full swing -- waiting outside for a car to pick him up to take him to the tournament. 

That's when, a surveillance video shows, plainclothes police Officer James Frascatore swoops in. 

In the brief time he was detained, Blake has told CNN that neither Frascatore nor other officers present identified themselves as law enforcement or displayed their badges. 

Two law enforcement sources later said that investigators looking into the purchase of cell phones using fraudulent credit cards had set up a sting operation at the hotel. The male suspect that they were actually looking for was later taken into custody. 

Blake went public with his story to a number of news organizations, and New York authorities never denied his version of events. In fact, De Blasio and Bratton to called to apologize before Monday's meeting. 

Not every innocent person who gets taken down and detained by authorities gets such apologies, much less a face-to-face meeting with a mayor and top law enforcement official. 

While noting ""the video ... is pretty compelling evidence by itself,"" Blake acknowledged that his celebrity has played a role in his treatment since the incident. And now, he says, he wants to make the most of it. 

""Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it,"" he said. ""So I'm going to try to react to it in a positive manner and make a difference for all those that may not ... be in the same situation.""",Blake seeks 'lasting impact' after NYPD takedown,News,WMTW,2015-09-22T15:00:24Z

Dozens of migrants have left rocks along the Italian coastline near the French border where they fled after their tent camp was raided by Italian police. 

Police dismantled the 3-month-old camp Wednesday morning. The migrants had been camped out in Italy hoping to travel onward via France since June, but French border police would not permit their passage. 

The news agency ANSA said the local bishop helped persuade the migrants and a group of volunteers who have been helping them to leave the rocky coastline, where removing them by force would have been difficult. 

Ventimiglia Mayor Enrico Ioculano told Sky TG24 that law enforcement would determine where to take them. A bus was waiting nearby.

5:30 p.m. 

Czech Interior Minister Milan Chovanec says a joint drill by the country’s police and military to be ready to deal with a possible increased numbers of migrants has produced “satisfactory results.” 

The one-day drill was conducted along the country’s border with Austria and included 500 police officers and 300 service members. 

Thousands of migrants fleeing wars and poverty have been using the Balkan states and Hungary every day on their way to Germany and other Western states, but they are traveling through the Czech Republic in much smaller numbers. 

Czech police boosted their presence on the Austrian-Czech border in response to Germany’s decision to restore border controls, but the Czechs haven’t done the same yet. 

Officials also say the Czech military is planning to deploy up to 25 soldiers in Hungary at the request of the Hungarian government to help protect the border of the Schengen zone, and the Czech police are ready to do the same.

Finland has suddenly and unexpectedly emerged as a top destination for Iraqis who are crossing the Mediterranean to Europe along with hundreds of thousands of others fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. 

Some 11,900 Iraqis have applied for asylum in Finland this year, accounting for 70 percent of all claims. More than 8,600 arrived in September alone. 

“For me, this is where I want to be,” said Firas Afandi a 48-year-old Iraqi electrical engineer said outside a reception center for asylum-seekers in Helsinki. “People here are civilized, calm and it’s quiet.” 

Finnish officials say the sudden increase seems to be partly driven by online rumors about quick handling of asylum applications, generous benefits and an abundance of jobs. In reality, Finland’s reception for asylum-seekers differs little from other EU countries, and its economy has entered its fourth year of recession.

How long does it take to swim from Turkey to Greece? 

Hussam Jaban, a 21-year-old English literature student from Syria, said it took about four hours to swim from the small Turkish resort of Kas to the eastern Greek island of Castellorizo. 

Jaban told The Associated Press he swam with 12 other people “and we all made it.” He said the group “had a small inflatable boat for a three-year-old child and we pushed it along.” 

Speaking Wednesday as he crossed into Macedonia, Jaban said he swam to avoid paying smugglers and keep enough money for the rest of the long journey through Europe to seek safety.

3:05 p.m. 

Slovakia’s prime minister says his government has formally approved challenging a European Union decision to redistribute 120,000 asylum-seekers among the bloc’s 28 nations. 

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico declined to give further details about the lawsuit Wednesday. 

After the refugee-sharing move was approved by EU ministers last week, Fico said Slovakia was not ready to accept the plan and was planning a legal complaint against it at an EU court in Luxembourg. 

Slovakia voted against the plan along with the Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary.

Relief agencies have set up a tent city at Greece’s border with Macedonia to cope with the growing number of migrants and refugees trying to reach central Europe. 

The facilities, being set up over the past week, reached a capacity of 1,000 Wednesday outside the Greek border town of Idomeni, one of the busiest bottlenecks in the country. 

Police said about 4,500 people had arrived at Idomeni in the past 24 hours, most by bus from Athens. 

The uneven arrival of refugees — most fleeing Syria’s civil war — has forced many to spend the night at the border.

12:35 p.m. 

A Danish court has jailed a 25-year-old stateless Palestinian for three weeks who is suspected of attempted murder for stabbing a policeman in Denmark’s largest asylum center. 

Police spokesman Henrik Suhr says in a statement that police found some evidence the suspect may have sympathies for Islamic extremists in Syria, but added the man also “may be mentally unstable.” He said the man was about to be deported. 

No further details emerged from Wednesday’s custody hearing held behind closed doors. The policeman was seriously injured Tuesday at Center Sandholm, north of Copenhagen.

Italy’s top security official says fewer migrants are arriving in Italy this year, contrary to European trends. 

Interior Minister Angelino Alfano told the Schengen Commission on Wednesday that 130,577 asylum-seekers have arrived in Italy so far this year, 8,000 fewer than the same period last year. 

At the same time, the number of migrants arriving in the European Union this year has more than doubled to over 522,000. 

Eritreans fleeing political oppression and forced military conscription are the largest group arriving in Italy, about 27 percent of the total. Nigerians are next, followed by Somalians and Syrians, who have largely shifted their route to the much shorter, less dangerous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece. 

Alfano said Italy is now hosting 98,000 migrants.

11:40 p.m. 

Italian police have emptied out a migrant tent camp in the border city of Ventimiglia, prompting dozens of migrants to flee to rocks along the shoreline. There were no reports of violence. 

Mayor Enrico Ioculano told Sky TG24 the city had sought to have the camp near the French border removed for months, saying it created “numerous difficulties” for the city and its residents. 

Ventimiglia was a flashpoint in June, when migrants were prevented from leaving Italy by heightened French border controls. 

Police stood by near the rocks hours after the dawn blitz Wednesday, with the atmosphere remaining tense. Italian news reports said the bishop of Ventimiglia had arrived to speak with the asylum-seekers and the volunteers helping them in an attempt to diffuse the situation.

Authorities in Greece say 2 people have died and 47 people have been rescued from a dinghy near the island of Lesbos. 

The Greek Coast Guard said the incident occurred early Wednesday and that the bodies recovered were of a woman and a child. The survivors were being taken to the island. The circumstances of their deaths were not immediately clear. 

Lesbos is the busiest entry point for migrants reaching the European Union, with some 2,000 arrivals per day from nearby Turkey. Most are Syrians fleeing the country’s civil war. The International Organization for migration says over 522,000 people — a record number — have crossed the Mediterranean this year seeking refuge in Europe, 388,000 coming through Greece.

French authorities say an Eritrean migrant has been found dead in the tunnel beneath the English Channel, the latest of several killed this year as thousands of people fleeing poverty and war try to cross illegally from France into Britain. 

The administration for the Pas-de-Calais region says the migrant was apparently hit by a freight train near the entrance to the tunnel in Calais. It said the man was in his 20s and was found alone Wednesday.

fef1bd14-f69b-48ea-8316-42b0f91dfd39,"ST. PETERSBURG — Major League Baseball officials, surprised by a proposal this week to build a spring training facility for the Atlanta Braves at the Toytown landfill, said Friday that a new stadium for the Tampa Bay Rays remains “the most pressing need.” 


The statement acknowledged Florida’s longtime commitment to spring training facilities, but urged local officials to resolve the ongoing stadium impasse between the Rays and the St. Petersburg City Council. 


“Major League Baseball is committed to working with the Rays to secure a new ballpark in cooperation with the Tampa Bay region,” the statement said. “This can only happen with the support of local political and business leaders.” 


Concerns were raised after a proposal by SportsPark Partners LLC to build a $662 million complex at the former landfill became public on Tuesday. It is one of three proposed developments for the site, and it includes the Braves, who said their goal is to move their spring training operations there in 2018. 


The Pinellas County Commission is expected to review the proposals in the next month. 


At risk for the Rays and for St. Petersburg is county tourism money that would be needed to build a new stadium for the Rays if the team remains in Pinellas. That money potentially could be diverted to the SportsPark project. 


MLB said it only learned of the baseball proposal with the Braves this week. In a statement Friday, Rays President Brian Auld said the team appreciates the league’s “attention to this matter. We fully agree with and support their statement.” 


St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman, who has tried to broker a stadium deal between the Rays and the City Council, noted the city’s long spring training history, “but we are now a major league city with a major league quality of life and world-class amenities.” 


“My focus is on keeping the Rays in St. Petersburg. Absent that, my focus is on keeping them in our region,” he said in a written statement. “I am hopeful that a majority of our city council members will someday share this priority.” 


The Rays, whose annual attendance ranks last or near last in the league, have been seeking  a new stadium for more than five years. However, their lease with city for Tropicana Field doesn’t expire until 2027, and the council has refused to let the team look for local sites outside the city. 


The council rejected a deal Kriseman crafted with the Rays that would let the team look for stadium locations in Pinellas or Hillsborough counties. Most recently, the council deadlocked on the deal in a 4-4 vote. 


City Councilman Karl Nurse said the SportsPark proposal should increase the urgency of council members to reach a deal with the team before the county decides to use its tourist tax money elsewhere. The bonds used to build Tropicana Field will be paid off this month, potentially making that money available for a new stadium. 


“To me, the bottom line is the mayor and the city council, between the end of this baseball season and the beginning of the next one, have to put together a deal with the Rays to get started on this thing,” Nurse said. “If that money gets sent elsewhere, I think the door closes and one day we’re going to wake up to the sound of Major League Baseball announcing the Rays will play their first game when this contract ends in another city,” he said. 


With a city council election in November, Nurse, who supported Kriseman, said a newly elected member could break the council deadlock, or perhaps a current member might reconsider. 


Some council members have suggested asking the county to set aside the tourist tax money, about $7 million a year, until the city resolves the issue. County commissioners and Tourist Development Council members have expressed reluctance to do so. 


Council member Jim Kennedy, who opposed Kriseman’s deal, said he is disappointed the mayor has refused to commission a study of the Tropicana site to determine its value before deciding on the lease question. 


“Everybody hears the clock ticking,” he said. “I thought the economic study of the Tropicana site was a way forward, especially when the Rays were willing to pay half of it, to put more information on the table,” he said. 


Council Chairman Charlie Gerdes said the SportsPark proposal and the statement from MLB don’t add much urgency to the situation for him. 


“I’m of the opinion it’s fairly urgent already,” he said. “I just want to make sure the revenue source we are currently using doesn’t get (used) for some other project.” 


Gerdes, who voted in favor of Kriseman’s agreement, said he was relieved to hear that neither MLB nor the Rays knew about the Braves deal with SportsPark beforehand. 


“I was concerned if they had spoken to the Rays, and the Rays allowed it to go forward,” he said. 


“I think the conventional wisdom was the Braves would have spoken to and at least given both the Rays and MLB a heads-up on the thing. It appears that did not happen.”

da1d6db7-977f-486c-88a5-19fa0e259fd3,"Aquarium Software has announced the launch of a new customer contact centre solution which will revolutionise the way businesses perform in this highly competitive and regulated environment.

(PRWEB) August 31, 2015 

StepOne, by Aquarium is the latest technology platform allowing businesses to build, manage and maintain campaign scripts, data and responses, integrate with existing data solutions and automate processes quickly, saving all contact centres massive amounts of time and money.

Using the industry proven Aquarium platform as its backbone, the pioneering system is designed to be introduced into busy contact centre environments with the minimum of business interruption, enabling campaigns to be implemented in no time at all. Aquarium Director, Ed Shropshire says, “The introduction of StepOne could see contact centres potentially save time and money not just in direct operational areas such as staffing and training but in related ones too such as compliance, IT and database maintenance.

“We’re very excited about StepOne and how it can streamline and automate contact centre processes and costs,” said Ed. “Early adopters of the platform are reporting to us a significant increase in their productivity alongside a reduction in time spent on training and implementation. Cross-product communication is improved as well, allowing businesses to adapt to the needs of the customer, instantly and in real-time.

“Crucially however, StepOne is designed to require very little maintenance or investment, but still deliver huge returns. By delivering adaptable campaigns and improving customer’s conversations and journey, the innate benefits of StepOne empower contact centres and keep them ahead of the curve.”

As well as improving communications all round, Aquarium’s latest software also allows other business processes to be integrated, such as CRM, dialler and regulatory compliance – all resulting in an integrated approach to the customer conversation. 

When asked what single feature makes StepOne so special, Ed responds, “StepOne’s ability to integrate all the data silos of an established contact centre operation into one user and customer experience is the key to its design. Those businesses that understand the power of integrated data will without doubt flourish and succeed.”

a4401f0c-ed4f-4407-a334-4e653faacb20,"Go figure. As the price of natural gas is declining – National Grid announced last week about a 10-percent drop in costs of a residential customer using gas to heat their home – and natural gas is being used more and more to generate electricity, shouldn’t the cost of electricity also go down? 
 
It’s not looking that way, according to National Grid spokesman David Graves. 
 
In an interview Friday, Graves said it is more likely the company will ask for an increase in its standard offer later this fall. If approved by the Public Utilities Commission, the electric rate would take affect in January. 
 
So how do lower natural gas costs equate to higher electric rates if natural gas is used to generate more than 40 percent of the electricity used by Rhode Islanders? 
 
Graves reminds that the requested electric rate would apply to the first six months of the New Year. 
 
National Grid buys electricity and passes the cost along to the consumer. It does not earn a mark up on the cost. It makes its money on the transmission of electricity, which is separately identified in electric bills and also regulated by the PUC. 
 
Graves explained the cost of generating electricity is projected to increase in the winter months because of the increased demand for natural gas and constraints in the system of delivery pipelines to this region. As residential and commercial gas users are given priority over generating plants, he said, when cold weather causes a spike in natural gas usage, generating plants are forced to shut down or convert to using fuel oil to continue running. This jacks up the cost of electricity. 
 
It was that projected cost increase in the winter cost of electricity that prompted National Grid to ask for an electric rate increase of about 25 percent last year at this time. The proposed rate increase would have applied to the first six months of 2015. 
 
The PUC eventually approved the increase, but to lessen the impact on the customer spread it over the full year even though electric rates traditionally drop for the second half of the year starting in July. 
 
Graves said National Grid would file the proposed electric rate by Oct. 15. 
 
As for a reduction in national gas rates, a press release issued last week said customers could expect to see a 9.6 percent reduction in their bill starting Nov. 1 if the lower rate is approved by the PUC. That translates into a $120 a year savings for a customer using 846 therms. The company delivers natural gas to 257,000 Rhode Island residential customers. 
 
When coupled with a natural gas price reduction that went into effect on Nov. 1, 2014, National Grid ’s Rhode Island customers will be paying approximately 14 percent less than what they paid through most of 2014, according to the company. 
 
The reduction in cost was touted by Timothy F. Horan, president of National Grid in Rhode Island. 
 
In a statement, he said, “We know the winter season can pose an extra challenge when it comes to energy costs, so we’re very happy to be able to pass on the savings created with the availability of lower cost natural gas. Domestic natural gas is essential to providing the mix of energy sources that is essential to our region’s future growth and prosperity.” 
 
Yet still, it would seem, lower gas costs should also result in lower electric costs. 
 
Asked if National Grid is buying electricity at lower costs than projected a year ago, Graves pointed out that, yes, costs are lower at this time of year. He thought it possible that National Grid is collecting more in payments for electricity than it is paying out. If that is the case, he said the additional revenues would be considered in projecting the rate going forward. In other words, lower natural gas costs could impact electric rates after all.","Natural gas prices headed down, but maybe not electric rates",News,Cranston Herald,2015-09-18T02:21:11Z

8447a9fe-d0db-4b9a-9b8a-b60dc1cf5e15,"The current El Nino weather phenomenon is expected peak between October and January and could turn into one of the strongest on record, experts from the World Meteorological Organization said at a news conference on Tuesday.

Climate models and experts suggest surface waters in the east-central Pacific Ocean are likely to be more than 2 degrees hotter than average, potentially making this El Nino one of the strongest ever.

The forecast from the United Nations weather agency consistent with . Typically, the warm air above the eastern Pacific is causing increased precipitation over the west coast of South America and dry conditions over the Australia/Indonesia archipelago and the Southeast Asia region, said Maxx Dilley, director of the WMO's Climate Prediction and Adaptation Branch.

El Nino can also bring higher rainfall and sometimes flooding to the Horn of Africa, but causes drier conditions in southern Africa, Dilley said.

Climate scientists are better prepared than ever with prediction models and data on El Nino patterns, but the impact of this El Nino in the northern hemisphere is hard to forecast because there is also an Arctic warming effect at work on the Atlantic jetstream current.

""The truth is we don't know what will happen. Will the two patterns reinforce each other? Will they cancel each other? Are they going to act in sequence? Are they going to be regional? We really don't know,"" said David Carlson, the director of the World Climate Research Programme.

This El Nino could also be followed abruptly by a cooling La Nina, which, along with the advance of global warming, was adding to the uncertainty, Carlson said.

""I think we all think that there's some climate warming signals starting to show up in the El Nino record,"" he said.

But he added that it is still unclear how global warming is affected the frequency or magnitude of El Nino events.

The head of an Alaska-based pro-industry group says she worries about the loss of support jobs and investment with Royal Dutch Shell's departure from the Arctic. 
 
Kara Moriarty is president and CEO of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association. She said Shell had between 600 to 800 workers on shift, and another 600 to 800 waiting to replace them as they came off a two- or three-week rotation this summer. 
 
Besides the billions of dollars Shell invested in its Arctic drilling program, she says they probably spent another billion this summer in exploring one test well. Disappointing results from that well led Shell to announce Monday it was ceasing its Alaska Arctic operations for the foreseeable future. 
 
Moriarty also says other companies holding leases in the Arctic were waiting to see what Shell did. Now she worries we won't see any offshore Alaska drilling for decades.

She made the statement Monday on the heels of Shell saying it will cease Arctic operations, in part due to unpredictable federal regulations. 
 
Alaska's junior senator, Republican Dan Sullivan, said environmental groups are cheering the news, but he says it's a sad day for Alaska and working Americans. 
 
Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley countered it's tremendous news, and a credit to the people who made clear that Arctic drilling in unacceptable.

Without resource development both on- and off-shore, he says they are facing ""a fiscal crisis beyond measure.""

b0b2a90c-28a2-4168-a709-7d4349482d1e,"(MENAFN - Daily News Egypt) Egypt's health and education sectors and local administration authorities are the most corrupt and overstaffed sectors in Egypt, said Judge Sameh Kamal, head of the Administrative Prosecution Authority.

Kamal cited the economic situation as the reason behind the Egyptian administrative entities' overstaffing, adding that the Civil Service Law had previously been proposed, but the Mubarak regime failed to pass it. Kamal stressed the Administration Prosecution's right to independence, and to adopt a new law that fits its role and the changes taking place in Egypt.

Why are you now specifically demanding a new law for the Administrative Prosecution Authority?

The Administrative Prosecution Authority is an independent judicial body, according to the 2012 and 2014 constitutions. It was established as an independent judicial body with two wings: the Administrative Prosecution Authority; and the Administrative Control Authority. Afterwards, they naturally split, but the prosecution law remained with its scattered texts and unrelated items. No amendment to the law has been made so far. Although many things happened, including the economic foundation and public sector that were demolished and the two revolutions, the Administrative Prosecution Law is still too rigid to be amended, unlike many things that were changed. However, they needed processing and new insights. So we seek to pass a new law that fits all the variables that I mentioned.

Why do you ask for separation from the Ministry of Justice?

In the first place, the Administrative Prosecution was affiliated with the presidency, then it was referred to the Ministry of Justice, but the Constitution stipulates that it is an independent judicial body. However, the word ""independent"" does not mean a 100% independent entity, as there are administrative matters related to the Ministry of Justice. In addition, the Administrative Prosecution is an independent body, according to the current legal texts, when it comes to its judicial performance.

Do you think that your demand for independence will receive support?

I do not pre-empt the incidents, and prefer to wait and see until we get what we want.

What is the nature of the disciplinary committees?

Disciplinary committees were formed to conduct and facilitate the work flow, in accordance with the law that allowed the Administrative Prosecution to issue sanctions within a certain range, while in the future it will be up to the Administrative Prosecution Law.

Do you think there is a conflict with the State Council in terms of judicial specialties?

The Administrative Prosecution replaced the administrative authority in issuing the penalty, as the former was entitled to refer the employee, who was proven guilty after an investigation into his work, for an administrative penalty. The disciplinary committees now assume this task, to confirm the idea of ‹‹deterrence for violators. The law stipulates that disciplinary courts are specialised in trying the appeals filed against the Administrative Prosecution's decisions, and it does not contradict with the jurisdiction of the State Council.

The investment complaints unit is also seen as contradictory to the dispute resolution committees?The investment complaints unit's structure does not contradict with other bodies; rather, the dispute resolution committees can refer those working in the administrative authority that obstruct its work to the unit. In this way, it helps these bodies and does not conflict with them.

Does this mean the possibility of establishing more alike committees?

It is possible to establish more units based on a perception of the prosecution's future role.

What is the authority's stand regarding the Civil Service Law?

We said that the Civil Service Law is good, but not enough. It is good to issue a law based on the general perception of the civil service, but not enough because the flabbiness was not a result of a law, but the economic state in Egypt which stopped producing special jobs after the world financial crisis of 2008, which left a huge impact on the economy. The people were deceived and the economy reached a state of flabbiness and stagnation. Schools and university graduates do not find jobs, in addition to the early retirement of employees, all within an economy that does not provide job opportunities, so the unemployment rate increased. The law was originally formed in the days of Hosni Mubarak, by former minister of administrative development Dr Ahmed Darwish. At the time, he tried to promote it, but he failed and the regime fell, until it was taken out of the drawers again, and new amendments made. We queried and provided our opinion in several memoranda. We have no objection to the law, especially as it was amended in a considerable way. The initial draft law was very bad.

What is your stand regarding the issue of ""zero mark"" in secondary schools?

This issue may lead to something or nothing.

But there is a popular rejection of this result?

The role of the Administrative Prosecution did not end in the case. It was referred to the Forensic Medicine Authority [who can investigate handwriting samples], and the issue is still under investigation. In such important cases, it is not required to rush; rather we must reach a result. But I hope not to use this issue to undermine the efforts of correcting hundreds of exams papers. Public secondary schools have hundreds of thousands of students, and it is not a high ratio if we monitored two or three cases.

The ratio is not high, but was the size of the offence explicit?

In Egypt, there is a hard exerted effort to get out of this current crisis, which should be appreciated. Whoever deviates away from the public behaviour shall be punished.

The idea is the unbalance of the equation, the state facing a girl, who may be oppressed?

Regardless of any thing, if any deviation was proven, the perpetrator shall be punished.

Was the state's reaction violent?

Of course, I would have preferred it if an official came out to say this was being studied.

Why is corruption still rampant in the administrative authority?

I have already said that the Egyptian economy reached stagnation, and the country has grown old what do you expect? Corruption goes beyond all borders. Egypt was one of the latter countries in the ranking of countries transparency index. It was also in a state of liquidity, and even regulatory agencies were almost stagnant. I think that things are now moving in a better direction, and that there has been an improvement in the transparency index, as well as the fight against corruption. Economy is on its way towards improvement. The citizen now feels that he lives in a country that does the best for them, even if everything remains as it is.

What are the most corrupt sectors?

The most corrupt sectors in Egypt are local councils, education, and health. There is an attempt to reform the health sector. The state is trying to reform education and local councils. However, overall, it feels like we have semi-systems of education and health.

There are demands to protect employees from future prosecution if they did something wrong for the benefit of the state. Can you elaborate more on this?

There is a justified breach, and an unjustified breach. However, there shouldn't be a law that protects violations. Sooner rather than later, this law will be eliminated and swept away by the waves of time. The law protects the justified unintentional violations, and doesn't discriminate whoever breaches their permits, if they did so in good intention without harming the state.

Why are the recommendations of the Administrative Prosecution Authority not followed, especially in important issues?

Prosecutors' recommendations come at an ideal limit, but things do not go this way.

What does the administrative body need to improve on?

The administrative body needs training at a high level and as soon as possible, if we want to reach a result. We must spend on this training. They could be expensive, but the results are much better.

What about the restructuring?

A good new effective suitable training is what matters, in the eyes of citizens, to make the government job worth it.","Egypt- Investment complaints unit resolves conflicts, accelerates decision-making: Administrative Prosecution Authority head",News,MENAFN,2015-09-09T05:02:23Z

Iraqi Christian Relief Council: In 2007, our team began its journey and committed to take the responsibility of spreading the word about the brutal treatment of the Assyrian Christians in Iraq from that day forward. Today our work consists of humanitarian efforts, advocacy, prayer support, and education. We travel extensively throughout the United States of America on behalf of the indigenous people of Iraq , the Assyrians also known as Chaldeans and Syriacs. Despite the cruel ISIS attacks in 2014, we've witnessed the Assyrian Christians of Iraq remain steadfast. We are continually moved by the passion and perseverance of this ancient community. Our work is funded through the generosity of individuals, churches, foundations, and businesses.

d9db8190-72e3-413d-b04e-1b32b48b808c,"Murderers, rapists and violent gang leaders are to be moved at gunpoint They are being shifted from South Africa's notorious Pollsmoor Prison Police escorts will accompany the convoys amid fears of inmate escapes They are being moved due to deaths caused by a disease linked to rats  
More than 4,000 dangerous inmates are being evacuated from South Africa’s most notorious maximum-security prison following two deaths from a disease linked to rats. 

Murderers, rapists and violent gang leaders are being moved at gunpoint in a massive, high-risk operation at Pollsmoor Prison, where Nelson Mandela spent part of his incarceration. 

Police escorts will join the convoys of hardened criminals amid fears that prisoners will attempt to escape during the unprecedented move. 
   
More than 4,000 dangerous inmates are being evacuated from one of South Africa’s most notorious prisons 

No-one has ever successfully broken out of the Cape Town facility, so the mass movement of inmates could pose an irresistible opportunity to 'lifers' who have little or no chance of release. 

Details of how and when maximum security prisoners are being moved are shrouded in secrecy, Pollsmoor’s area commissioner Ntobela Mketshane said. 
 
'The police are involved, intelligence agencies are involved, and for obvious reasons we will not be releasing any information about how, where and when we will be transporting prisoners,' he said. 

The evacuation of the jail was prompted by the death of two inmates from a fatal disease caused by rats. The rodents are rife in the jail – which is overcrowded by 300 percent. 

A recent inspection described conditions at the prison 'deplorable' and 'deeply disturbing', with up to three prisoners sharing lice-infested beds. Chronic levels of under-staffing means warders supervise up to 70 inmates each. 

Constitutional Court Judge Edwin Cameron, who inspected the facility, saw prisoners suffering from untreated illnesses and starvation and others had not been permitted to leave their cells for months. 

'The extent of overcrowding‚ unsanitary conditions‚ sickness‚ emaciated physical appearance of the detainees‚ and overall deplorable living conditions were profoundly disturbing,' Judge Cameron wrote in his report, released last week. 
   
Lawyers for Oscar Pistorius (pictured) cited conditions at Pollsmoor Prison when arguing for him to serve his manslaughter sentence under 'correctional supervision' at home 

He observed inmates suffering from 'boils, scabies, wounds and sores from lice-infested bedding that has never been washed'. 

Manelisi Wolela, from the correctional services department, said the jail was being cleared to prevent an outbreak of leptospirosis - which is spread in rat urine. 

'We have been fumigating the place, but as of now we are moving the prisoners to other locations, and it will take some days to complete,' Mr Wolela said. 

The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (POPCRU) also condemned the 'inhumane conditions' at Pollsmoor. 

'The entire place is really a mess, nobody deserves to live in such a place,' spokesman Richard Mamabalo said. 'Our view is that prisons should not be a death sentence. It is meant to be a place where people can be rehabilitated.' 

Lawyers for Oscar Pistorius cited conditions at Pollsmoor and other jails when arguing for the convicted killer to be allowed to serve his manslaughter sentence under 'correctional supervision' at home. 

The 28 year-old sprinter has reportedly refused to eat prison rations at the Kgosi Mampuru II jail in Pretoria since his incarceration last October, amid fears of food poisoning. 

Although he was given the opportunity to prepare his own meals, Pistorius opts to eat from tins of fish and meat he buys at the inmates' tuck shop. 

The double amputee is being held on the hospital wing at the jail, in virtual isolation, after gang leaders voiced threats against him. He was due to have his case reviewed by a parole board on Friday, but will now wait another two weeks to hear when he will be released. 

Pistorius was due to be moved to house arrest last month after serving ten months of a five-year sentence for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. However, an eleventh hour intervention by South Africa’s justice minister meant he remains behind bars while the decision to release him is scrutinised.

Nathalie Delgado and Stephane Sophikitis first came to Finland on a one-month holiday in March 2010. During that trip they decided to come and stay in Autti.   

	  
 

	“In that month, we travelled in Finland from south to north, from Helsinki to Rovaniemi. We were looking for land to buy in northern Finland and we found that in Autti,” said Nathalie. 
 

	  
 

	“We began to live in Autti on September 24, 2010. We like living in this village, far from the city. The people here are good. They welcomed us. Our two children are very happy too to live in Autti. They don’t want to go back to France or to any city. They have good friends here!” 
 

	  
 

	Living away from France has not been a problem. “We can find almost all the foodstuffs and drinks in Finland, except regional specialties like chestnuts, saucissons or good olives!” Good, warm clothing has helped them accustom to cold winters and the darkness has not been a bother either. They, however, admit to miss occasionally their families and the mosquito-free hot summer time.

The family supports itself with entrepreneurship. Stephane has his own business, started recently, offering agricultural services, renovation, repair and troubleshooting. Nathalie runs a husky farm named Wolftrail. “We have 50 dogs: husky, Malamute, dog wolf and Alaskan husky. Taking care of 50 dogs on a daily basis is not easy, but I love my dogs and I like to take care of them,” exclaimed a proud Nathalie.   

	  
 

	Taking care of dogs is nothing new to the family. “We have had northern dogs for twelve years. I saw most of my dogs being born. Every day I feed them, clean the paddock, and train some of them. We have a playground where they can run and play free, together,” said Nathalie. 
 

	  
 

	Wolftrail organises husky activities during the winter and early spring months. “We organise sled dog safaris between December and April. We accept people in small groups of four to five.” 
 

	  
 

	“Each person drives his own sled and learns to take care of his team of five to six dogs. We teach them how to put the harness, the difference in breed among the dogs, and the arrangement of dogs in the team; we teach them how to feed and take care of the dogs. We travel 30-40km a day on various tracks. Ninety per cent of our clients are French.” 
 

	  
 

	The French family prefers the winter. “It’s white, beautiful and calm; the darkness is relaxing and of course we love to drive sled, and I think Lapland is the best choice for sledding dogs!”

BY ARI BENDERSKY 

After hitting the theater or ballet on a Friday or Saturday night, you might well be hungry. And sometimes a hot dog, pizza or burrito just won't cut it. That's where these restaurants come into play, offering refined late-night eats that beat the pants off a 24-hour greasy spoon. Unless otherwise listed, these restaurants offer their full menu until the kitchen closes. 

Serves until 12 a.m. 

The Brixton: If you get a craving for diver scallops with vanilla carrot puree, pork belly with watermelon and pancetta or chicken and waffles with bacon-braised green beans and bourbon maple syrup, Andersonville's Brixton will fix you up. 5420 N. Clark St. 

Mfk: What Mkf lacks in size (29 seats, including 13 at the bar) it makes up for in flavor with cuisine from Northern Spain: crunchy prawn heads; Cantabrian salt-cured anchovies; oxtail croquettes; braised rabbit with kaffir lime coconut and salsa verde; and cobia collar with clams and shrimp. Add a curated Mediterranean wine list with a focus on crisp, mineral-driven whites and you just took a trip across the pond. 432 W. Diversey Ave. 

Ramen San: This crew spent time traveling throughout Japan researching the best ramen spots to make their offerings as authentic as possible before adding a bit of their River North swagger to the ambiance. You can get sashimi, wontons, gyoza and chicken wings, but it's really about the seven types of ramen (kimchi and fried chicken; braised beef; roasted vegetables) and the late-night fried rice (served after 10 p.m.). Bonus: The kitchen stays open until 1 a.m. on Saturdays. 52 W. Hubbard St. 

Serves until 1 a.m. 
Avec: Visit one of Chicago's top culinary destinations for Mediterranean-inspired small and large plates such as sliced butcher's steak served with berbere spice, tomatoes, cucumber and chickpea hummus; squid-ink pasta with mussels, corn and shishito peppers; whole roasted fish; and their classic bacon-wrapped, chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. 615 W. Randolph St. 

Au Cheval: : The line at Au Cheval is no joke, but then again, neither are their thin griddled burger patties topped with American cheese, pickles and deliciously creamy Dijonnaise. You can also get chopped chicken liver, foie gras terrine, a fried bologna sandwich and honey-fried chicken. The piece de resistance? Chilaquiles, served only after midnight. 800 W. Randolph St. 

Rootstock: Since opening about five years ago, this wine-focused tavern continues to draw for its oft-changing menu, including charcuterie and cheese, merguez sausage with lentils and golden raisins, Lyonnaise salad, bucatini carbonara and its mostly Old World-focused wine list and extensive beer selection. 954 N. California Ave. 

Izakaya Mita : This quaint corner Bucktown spot has one of the city's best sake lists, but also a vast menu of Japanese ""tapas."" It recently launched late-night offerings on Friday and Saturday nights with a pared-down selection: Japanese-style fried chicken; pickles; marinated baby octopus; and bincho-grilled meats, vegetables and seafood as well as tempura. 1960 N. Damen Ave. 


The Betty : Fulton Market's the Betty is a melding of bar, lounge and restaurant. Kick back with a bottle of bubbles or a glass of bourbon and order off chef Rachel Dow's eclectic full menu. You can travel the world and get potato and mushroom pierogies, spaghetti with clams and rapini, chicken tikka masala or a sweet Southern-style banana pudding. 839 W. Fulton St. 

Izakaya at Momotaro : Set down a flight of stairs from the main dining room at Momotaro or through a separate entrance off Lake Street, the Izakaya is a dark den of liquid and culinary delights. Grab a menu hanging above the bar and deep dive into Japanese bar snacks including smoked kani king crab deviled eggs, uni chorizo toast, daily sashimi offerings and hot plates such as sizzling clams with roasted garlic and sake or spicy Nagoya beef ramen. 820 W. Lake St. 

Pub Royale : This whimsically designed British pub focuses on beer and cuisine from the subcontinent. The edited late-night menu still offers plenty of pub fare including potato, pea and fried onion samosas; cucumber raita with yogurt, tahini and mint; crispy cauliflower with sesame, cashew and a sweet and spicy sauce; and lamb dumplings. In addition to beer, wine and cider, you can explore the Royale Cups, Pimm's Cups, as well as mango lassi, a drink comprising mango, rum, yogurt, honey and bitters. 2049 W. Division St. 
 
articlePara - html? 
  
High Five Ramen: Set below Green Street Smoked Meats, this 16-seat spot offers four types of ramen: High Five (incredibly spicy, but can be ordered ""half spice"" or ""no spice""), Kanobo Spice (warning: ""There is no relief. Please don't order without careful consideration""), Shoyu  (""clean, light, earthy"") and Special (shrimp broth with blue prawns and shrimp dumpling). To drink: two beers, two sakes and one whiskey cocktail. 112 N. Green St. 

Black Bull and Bordel: Fancy some true-to-form tapas, pintxos and paella followed by flamenco? Black Bull delivers provincial Spanish dishes (confit suckling pig, jamon serrano croquettes, head-on prawns, seafood paella) paired with Spanish wine, beer and sherry. Then pop upstairs to Bordel to keep the party going with lively cabaret shows and sharable drinks served in large pitchers. 1721 W. Division St. 

The Purple Pig: While the name suggests pork (pork osso bucco with soft polenta, balsamic-braised pig tails), chef Jimmy Bannos' Mediterranean-inspired menu has plenty of vegetarian fare, such as butternut squash with pumpkin seeds and brown butter and salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese. 500 N. Michigan Ave. 

Haywood Tavern: A relative newcomer to the fast-growing California and Augusta intersection, Haywood features the cuisine from heralded veteran Rodney Staton in a casual, unpretentious, welcoming atmosphere inspired by the taverns of Europe. Come for a $3 draft PBR, stay for the $3.50 bites: salt cod croquettes, deviled egg-stuffed piquillo peppers, grilled octopus with Yukon gold potatoes and beef tartare with capers, cornichons and anchovy. Pro tip: If you find yourself in the area on a Monday, go in before 10 p.m. for a $15 lobster roll, chips and beer special. 2759 W. Augusta Blvd. 

Quartino Ristorante: Every night until 1 a.m., you can get Quartino's full menu of quality Italian fare with wood-fired Neapolitan pizzas, housemade pastas, osso bucco, eggplant parm, meatballs, risotto and a full bar with 50 Italian wines. Arriving after 1 a.m. on a Saturday? You can still get their crispy-crust pizzas until 2 a.m. 626 N. State St. 

RM Champagne Salon: Tucked down a cobblestone alley,  this French-inspired salon offers its full menu till midnight, then switches to a smaller late-night menu until 1 a.m.: crab claws with Louis dressing, oysters on the half shell and Maine lobster with a green Tabasco aioli; and flatbreads such as bacon, fontina cheese and onion. Dessert, which includes homemade gelato, is available until 2 a.m. 116 N. Green St. 
 
articlePara - html? 
  
Serves until 2:30 a.m. or 3:30 a.m. 
Celeste: Step away from the maddening River North crowds into a refined haven that feels like you've entered something from a bygone era with plenty of room to breathe. Celeste's late-night menu is available on its two floors as well as its rooftop (until 2:30 a.m. on Friday; 3:30 a.m. on Saturday), so you can get beef tartare with ramp aioli; fried Amish chicken; falafel made with red lentils; and bacon-infused mac and cheese. 111 W. Hubbard St. 

Serves until 4 a.m. 
Strings 2 Ramen Shop: The original Strings in Chinatown (2141 S. Archer Ave.) stops serving at 2 a.m., but when you're craving hand-pulled noodles with dashi broth with seaweed stock and ground meat or Shio Ramen (sea salt broth made with chicken or turkey bone stock or lobster stock and pieces of seared ostrich), its Lincoln Park counterpart can oblige. 1629 N. Halsted St.

Chinese handset-maker Gionee seems all geared up for a bigger bite of the Indian smartphone apple as it speeds up launches in the second half of 2015 along with confirming a $50 million investment to contract manufacture phones with electronics manufacturing services provider Foxconn and Dixon. The company released the new F103 smartphone on Sep 1 priced at Rs.10,399. Here is our analysis: 

What is good? 

The phone has a simple yet a very eye-pleasing design and is extremely light. The two-tone metal-plastic body gives the phone a fresh look. The protruding shiny metal edge of the phone is the difference maker. 

The five-inch HD display with a 320 ppi pixel density is quite bright and produces sharp images with no problems in viewing angles. The rear eight-megapixel camera with LED flash performs fairly well. The five-megapixel front camera performs excellently under well-lit conditions. 

The system-on-a-chip (SoC) of a 64-bit 1.3 GHz quad-core processor and a 2GB RAM unit is a good performer. No lags were experienced while switching between apps or two or more casual games. 

The phone comes with some good pre-loaded apps and tools which can take care of day-to- day normal usage. Gionee has added a user feedback app that will work out well for its loyal fans. It runs Amigo OS on top of Android Lollipop. 

The phone also comes with dual-SIM 4G LTE support, which means users can enjoy 4G experience from two service providers. The F103 also has an impressive battery backup from a 2,400 mAH battery which many would scoff at. 

In terms of storage, the phone comes with 9.18 GB available internal memory which is expandable to 32 GB. Another advantage is that it supports USB on-the-go (OTG) so users can plug-in their memory devices to share or enjoy content on the phone. 

Gionee also provides the OTG cable, a plastic cover and screen guard for the phone in the box. This is a positive for Gionee as most brands have reduced their size of phone boxes drastically and also aren’t providing headphones for their devices. 

What doesn’t work for the phone? 

In terms of the camera, the rear unit loses out on quality in dark or semi-dark conditions. The front camera could have been accompanied with a…",Gionee F103: Another good mid-segment option,News,MyInforms,2015-09-13T05:36:00Z

 Senegal U-23 won the Gold medal at the All-Africa Games Brazzaville 2015, after enjoying a 1-0 victory over Burkina Faso at Stade Alphonse Massamba-Debat in the final of the continental competition on Friday evening. 
It is the young Lions’ first-ever AAG football men’s tournament medal, with a fourth-place finish in Maputo in 2011 their best achievement to date. 

FC Metz midfielder Moussa Seydi was the hero after scoring the lone goal of the final after just 2 minutes of play. 

The Senegalese had launched their journey with back-to-back draws against Ghana and Nigeria in Group B, before sealing a 3-1 win over hosts Congo in the last four. 

The young Stallions, who may have been playing with heavy hearts as political turmoil hit Burkina Faso once again, had to settle for Silver, which remains a great achievement forty two years after their maiden AAG appearance in Lagos. 

Senegal will now try to keep their momentum going when they host the Africa U-23 Cup of Nations later this year, with the top three teams to qualify for the Summer Olympics Rio 2016.

b8c770f6-5755-4ef3-a122-e25846ccde84,"GreenCoinX , a global developer of crypto currency has reveals plans to introduce a treasury function in order to reduce volatility of XGC.  
In order to be acceptable any cryptocurrency needs to have a stable price which moves within a relatively small band and time ratio. A currency band will represent the price floor and ceiling within which the price of a given currency can trade. The currency band restricts how much the price can move relative to a reference currency or a basket of currencies.

f70b9972-a57d-4915-8110-651474cbc792,"NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Many of our favored stock market sentiment indicators have hit extreme levels recently, so now is a good time to review some of them. Typically, when sentiment hits a bearish extreme it's a contrarian positive signal for the markets. Conversely, when sentiment gets frothy and hits a bullish extreme, it's a contrarian negative signal. 
 
With that in mind lets take a look at some of the data that we track. 
 
First we can see below that the 21-day put/call ratio is at an extreme level going back three years:

Over the past three-year period, spikes up to the 1.05 area or higher have aligned fairly closely with market lows. We are currently up near the 1.15 level on this measure showing a high level of pessimism currently. 
 
Last week we saw the Investors Intelligence bull-bear spread fall to -2.2%, a level we have not seen since the 2011 correction, when it was somewhat lower. Typically when it gets to a single-digit spread or lower it starts to get our attention.

fdfb8379-79c3-4757-b8b6-e03df3d0db3e,"The decision by the Ministry of Youth & Sports to drastically reduce the work force of the Reclaiming the Beaches and Waterways Project from 1,701 to 850 has angered the workers who are reportedly planning to disrupt normal activities to draw the attention of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to their plight.

Sources close to the workers told the Daily Observer in an interview yesterday that Mr. Lance Gbagonyon, assistant minister for youth development at the MYS old the workers in a meeting with their representatives that ""we should stop working until they (MYS) can start recruitment.""

""We refused to accept his decision since already we have held discussions with the Ministry of Finance & Development Planning.

""Finance made us to submit the number of the work force and we were asked to make a break down since the Liberian government has provided US1M for the Project.

""We told the Ministry of Finance that we have 1,580 manual workers who receive US$60 each per month; 109 supervisors receive US$105 each a month while 4 co-monitors receive US$225 each per month and four senior monitors who are paid US$260 each per month,"" a representative of the beach worker said.

He added that for eight months, the total amount of US$857,400 would cover ""salaries for all the workers.""

He noted that ID services would amount to U$17,001 and U$116,599 would go towards tools and bank service charge that would make up the total amount of U$1M.

""But surprisingly, we were told the project would now be implemented by the MYS who are saying they want to do recruitment and they will only accept 850 manual workers,"" he stated.

The beach workers' representative said some of their leaders have held several meetings with officials at the MYS, including Minister Eugene Nagbe.

In a letter the beach workers addressed to Rep. Edward Forh, a copy of which is with the Daily Observer, they appealed to Rep. Forh to intervene so that the MYS would implement the project as directed by President Sirleaf.

""We are peaceful and law abiding citizens,"" they told Rep. Forh, and warned that the decision by the MYS to reduce the number of the workers and begin its own recruitment ""has the propensity to change all the gains we have made. In our minds, what we submitted to Finance Ministry covered the one million dollars allotted by you people. We do not know on what grounds Youth and Sports Ministry wants to reduce the number of persons to 850.""

Additional information gathered yesterday in the various communities which benefit from the project is that they are angry at the suggestion by the MYS to disrupt the smooth operation of their activities.

""I think the only way President Sirleaf will hasten to do what is best for us and the country is for us to make sure that she gets our attention,"" one of the workers said.

In a written response from the MYS issued by Public Relations Officer, N. MaCauley Paykue, the ministry said the following:

""The Ministry of Youth Sports (MYS) has not employed in any way or form Manual Workers on the Beaches and the Waterways Project. Therefore, MYS cannot tell people to stop working or continue working. The Ministry has its own recruitment methodology which is done through a lottery process for manual work. The lottery process is an open process for every participant.

""The current work force which is claimed at 1,701 needs to be verified and the MYS has begun holding stakeholders' discussions with especially commissioners in the project's zones to get their opinions on whether the project will do a complete new recruitment or maintain a particular number, which will be in line with the implementation manual.

""MYS has no service contract with anybody or a group of people at the moment, relative to the Beaches and Waterways project.

""When the time comes, the Ministry will, through the mass media, inform the public about the recruitment of beneficiaries for the project.

""The MYS has never informed any representative on the total number of beneficiaries.

""The 1,701 persons in question are not in the employ of the Ministry. However, MYS will put into place a mechanism to allow all youth in and around project communities to benefit.

""MYS has not employed any project beneficiary yet. So how can MYS lay off people? The MYS will provide an enabling environment for past workers and all youth who are interested in the project to take part in a lottery process in keeping with our recruitment procedures.

""Yes, MYS will provide employment and better sanitation opportunities for selected communities.

""MYS will hold consultations with key actors and follow project documents in the implementation of the Project,"" the statement reads.

Started by the Liberia Maritime Authority the ""Reclaiming Liberia's Beaches and Waterways"" that was meant to provide jobless Liberians in the slum communities empowerment, partnered with Monrovia City Corporation (MCC) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to clean the various Monrovia beaches and as a result provide jobs for many in New Kru Town, West Point, ELWA and PHP. It was also the brainchild of President Sirleaf who boasted of her administration providing jobs for nearly 1,900 Liberians in the various slum communities.

However, the project has cited financial difficulties whenever it was time to pay the workers, forcing the Liberia Maritime Authority to withdraw its involvement due to what LiMA officials describe as ""continuous embarrassment whenever it came time to pay the workers.""

The Liberian government has now made a budgetary allocation for the project and the Ministry of Youth & Sports will henceforth implement it, according to the government.",Angry Beach Workers May Resort to Violence,News,AllAfrica.com,2015-09-15T17:00:59Z

addd4198-b5cb-40aa-9275-251c6e3f9b6f,"The world will agree on new sustainable development goals this weekend. How hard will they be for Australia to meet? 

The weekend, more than 150 world leaders will converge on New York for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Summit.

This will see nations adopt a raft of new Sustainable Development Goals, which cover everything from poverty, hunger, education, gender equality and clean water.

They replace the Millenium Development Goals, which have a 2015 deadline.

According to Australia's Megan Davis, chairwoman of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the new goals will be ""really relevant and significant for Aboriginal Australia"".

Praising them as ""holistic"", Professor Davis said the goals focus more on Indigenous people than the previous millenium targets. But she warned, ""we are not doing enough and have a long way to go"" to meet them.

Here are four of the goals for 2030 and Australia's progress so far:

1. Reduce by at least half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty

According to ACOSS's 2014 Poverty in Australia report, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were far more likely to experience poverty than other Australians.

As of 2011, 19.3 per cent of Indigenous people were living below the poverty line, compared to 12.4 per cent of other Australians.

Indigenous Australians are also over-represented when it comes to accessing income support. They make up about 3 per cent of the population, but nearly 9 per cent of those on Newstart and 16 per cent of those on Youth Allowance.

2. End preventable deaths of newborns and children under five years of age 

Australia already has its own Closing the Gap target to halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five by 2018. This measure is currently rated as being ""achievable"", with the gap dropping by 35 per cent between 1998 and 2013.

But the Australian Human Rights Commission says the situation remains ""unacceptable"". Between 2009 and 2013, 621 Indigenous children died. This is 1.9 times the non-Indigenous rate.

A major ongoing issue is that as of 2011, babies born to Indigenous mothers are twice as likely to have a low birth weight (a major indicator of good health and survival).

3. Ensure that all girls and boys complete primary and secondary education

As of 2014, Australia was "". Nationally, the proportion of 20-24 year old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who finished school jumped from 45 per cent in 2008 to 59 per cent in 2012-13.

This comes amid a new emphasis on school attendance. While the numbers vary depending on how old a child is or where they go to school, the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous attendance can be as high as 30 per cent.

Australian governments want to close this gap by 2018.

4. Ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults achieve literacy and numeracy 

Australia is currently ""not on track"" to meet the COAG target to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy for Indigenous students.

There has been ""no overall progress"" in Indigenous reading and numeracy since 2008 – based on the outcomes of NAPLAN testing.

There is a difference between city and non-city students, however.

In 2014, 86 per cent of Indigenous students in metropolitan areas at least met the minimum standards for year 7 reading. This dropped to 35 per cent for Indigenous students in very remote areas.

Professor Davis said that other goals critical to Australia include boosting the political empowerment of women and ending violence, having more Indigenous people in decision making roles and land ownership.

0029ecc9-19f5-4236-b14c-bf9bd4493f12,"“Danger!” read multiple signs posted along the 2.7-mile long trail next to Crabtree Falls. 
  
Curtis Sheets, chief of Wintergreen Fire and Rescue, said he has never seen a more clearly marked trail. 
 
But visitors still disregard the signs, oftentimes with tragic results — a fact that concerns the rescue teams that respond to such incidents and the Nelson County community at large. 
 
At least 30 people have died at Crabtree Falls since the U.S. Forest Service began tracking the accidents in 1982. The most recent life claimed at the falls was that of Daniel Wayne Kistner, 31, of Chesapeake, who fell to his death on Aug. 29. 
 
In June, Franklin Miguel Madrana Guevara, 20, died after tumbling more than 75 feet. Guevara, who lived in Annandale but was in the U.S. on a visa from El Salvador, was visiting the site with a church group. 
 
In April 2013, Liberty University student Faith Helbig, 18, fell after her foot slipped on a rock. Like Kistner, both Helbig and Guevara crossed safety barriers, authorities have said. 
 
While rocks sticking out of the water offer spectacular views, most are covered with clear, slippery algae that can be treacherous for someone walking on them. The five cascades plummet a total of 1,200 feet, according to the Forest Service’s website. 
 
Sheets said he thinks a “game changer” in recent years that has contributed to accidents is the newfound prevalence of smart phones with built-in cameras, allowing anyone to take a great shot of the falls. 
 
“It used to be a lot of people didn’t have a way to take a picture unless they had a decent camera,” Sheets said. “Now everyone has a great camera, and they want that selfie to put on Facebook.” 
 
Sheets said the Wintergreen rescue team will go for years without an incident, and other years will have several. All of the deaths he can recall have been from people visiting from “outside of the local area.” 
 
“It just so happened we had a couple [of deaths] here recently, and it’s made people take notice,” he said. “I don’t want to be disrespectful but at the same time if you stay on the trail, you will return to your family.” 
 
Wintergreen Fire and Rescue has a special ropes team that is trained to undertake rescue missions that require extra safety, whether at Crabtree Falls or other rock features like Ravens Roost, where rescuers have to be prepared for anything. 
 
“We do always go on rope,” he said. “We don’t want to take anything for granted and become victims ourselves.” 
 
The deaths have become all too much for locals who live nearby to the falls. Arrington resident Jennifer Crowder said her heart goes out to all the victims’ families but has hiked the falls all her life without an incident. 
 
“People need to have respect for nature,” she said. “…When you go there, it’s so beautiful but there are dangers lurking everywhere. If you respect it and follow the rules and stay within the guidelines of the trail, it’s not an issue.” 
 
“Danger! Multiple fatalities have occurred here because people got off this trail and climbed onto the rocks. The rocks are extremely slippery due to a clear algae,” one sign reads. 
 
“Danger! Young men and women between 18 and 25 years of age who are bright, intelligent and educated fit the profile of the victims of the siren of Crabtree Falls,” another sign says. 
 
“I don’t know how you could sign it or mark it better,” Sheets said. “You could do a prison fence and that’s really unfortunate.” 
 
Nelson County Supervisor Tommy Harvey, also chief of the Rockfish Valley Volunteers Fire and Rescue Department, said there once were no signs or barriers at the falls, and he doesn’t understand why people cross the barriers that now are in place. 
 
“You can get the same picture looking from the bottom to the top as you can from the top to the bottom,” he said. “Go to the bottom if you want to get that shot. These rocks…they get that moss on them and when water gets on there, it’s non-forgiving. Once you start, you’re in for the ride. It’s a nasty fall.” 
 
Crowder said she is concerned the deaths will prompt authorities eventually to place more barricades on the path, which she said would take away from the natural beauty of the falls. 
 
“That would be the worst thing ever,” she said. “It takes away from the reason people go, and it’s destroying nature. It breaks my heart. There are rules for a reason, and people are losing their lives.” 
 
Crowder has been a Nelson County resident most of her life and remembers taking school field trips to the falls. She also has taken her children several times. 
 
“We still make the trip numerous times during the year to go up there,” she said. “It’s free and beautiful, it’s the best entertainment ever and it’s good exercise. Maybe this death will be an eye opener for people, it’ll give people a reason to stop and think.” 
 
Harvey said he doesn’t know what else can be done to prevent another tragedy. 
 
“You’ve got signs saying not to go over it and it will kill you,” he said. “There are barriers where you shouldn’t go. If you can’t play by the rules it’s an unsafe area — but they have made it safe, provided you follow the rules.”","Rescue crews, locals hope awareness of recent deaths at Crabtree Falls will prevent future accidents",News,Lynchburg News and Advance,2015-09-10T10:30:00Z

Statement About Cannabis Markets

The use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis is prohibited by federal law. This includes medical and recreational cannabis. Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly. What was the law last week is not the law today and what is the law today may not be the law next week. This means that at any time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors understand that the cannabis industry is a high-risk investment. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shut-downs.

Baltimore Ravens outside linebacker Terrell Suggs left Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos with an injury. Suggs left the game with what appeared to be a foot injury, and after getting looked at on the sidelines, he was taken to the locker room on the cart.

The Statesman Journal reports (http://stjr.nl/1KcB6UH ) that the council's vote Monday moves toward amending the existing ordinance to allow anyone over 21 to purchase marijuana, not just those with a state medical marijuana registration card.

The measure will advance to a second reading at the Sept. 28 council meeting.

Oregon passed Measure 91 in November. The law legalized the sale and use of recreational marijuana in the state. At the end of the legislative lesion, a law allowing medical dispensaries to conduct early sales of recreational marijuana tax-free was also passed.

5670d042-372d-4e4d-b04a-ff00bee848b6,"Manchester (United Kingdom) (AFP) - Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, who came within minutes of joining Real Madrid last week, signed a new four-year contract with the English Premier League club on Friday.

The announcement caps a remarkable turn of events after the Spain international was on the verge of signing for the Spanish giants only for the transfer to collapse because of paperwork arriving past the permitted deadline.

United announced on their official Twitter account: ""David de Gea has signed a new four-year contract at #mufc with an option to extend for a further year.""

De Gea, 24, said: ""I am delighted to be starting this new chapter in my United career.

""I have always enjoyed playing with these great players in front of our fantastic fans. Manchester United is a special club and Old Trafford is an ideal place for me to continue to develop my career.

""I'm looking forward to putting a difficult summer behind me and concentrating on working hard to improve and help my team-mates to be successful.""

The news of an extension was understandably well received by United manager Louis van Gaal, who said: ""I am absolutely delighted David has signed a new contract.

""He is one of the best goalkeepers in world football. I am very pleased that he will be part of the team for many years to come.

""David made a very important contribution to our performance last season and he has been the club's Player of the Year for the last two seasons.""

That De Gea has committed his future to United is all the more remarkable given the events of the past few months.

The Spaniard, long courted by Real, was on the brink of a move to Madrid worth between 30 and 40 million euros and involving Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas in part-exchange.

But the deal collapsed at the last minute, with a Spanish Professional League (LFP) spokesperson telling AFP that De Gea had not been registered as a Madrid player.

- Transfer saga -

The Spanish club subsequently released a statement accusing United of sending the necessary documents after the deadline had passed in Spain.

In a statement of their own, United laid the blame at Madrid's door, adding: ""The club is delighted that its fan-favourite double Player of the Year, David de Gea, remains a Manchester United player.""

De Gea hasn't played for United this season after being dropped by van Gaal, who claimed the player had told him he wasn't in the right frame of mind to play while the transfer saga dragged on.

But with his future now cleared up De Gea said he is set to return to the United team in time for Saturday's showdown at home to fierce rivals Liverpool.

""It is a perfect moment to come back,"" De Gea told MUTV.

""We are at Old Trafford against Liverpool, one of the biggest games in the world and I know the fans will love it if we win the game.

""I trained really hard and I played with my national team and of course I feel ready and 100 per cent fit.""

Van Gaal said he felt for De Gea and the ordeal he had ""suffered"", but the goalkeeper insisted the transfer talk is now a thing of the past.

""(There was) lots of speculation this summer but I keep my hard work and now I am relaxed, I am happy here, now we have to look forward to this season, to play well, win the games and hopefully we can win a trophy,"" he said.

""It was a different summer. I keep my focus, I keep calm and I keep my hard work.

""I feel really well. I would like to say thank you to them (the fans) for the support.""","United's De Gea completes remarkable U-turn, signs new contract",News,Yahoo! News,2015-09-11T19:18:58Z

f56c6e9e-5462-4d49-9337-23ae55d45a6e,"By Kampala — The automated trading system which Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) switched to on July 20, has increased the volume of turnover at stock by Shs17 billion, which signifies the importance of the system.

An automated trading system is a computerised-based trading application set up to automatically buy and sell securities on an exchange.

Speaking during the launch of the system at the Kampala Serena Hotel yesterday, USE chief executive officer Paula Bwiso said: ""Since the beginning of the year, we have realised a Shs130 billion turnover. Out of this, Shs17 billion which represents a growth of 12 per cent in turnover has been realised since we started automated trading on July 20.""

Mr Bwiso said automation enhances both liquidity and flexibility with regard to the time it takes to conclude a deal, adding that 68 per cent market participants are foreigners who have been investing actively in Uganda's stock since the beginning of the year.

""Automaton has already brought about efficiencies and reduced on the settlement time from five to three days which is in line with international standards,"" he said.

As of August 31, USE market capitalisation was Shs24.9 trillion, down from Shsh27 trillion in July. The drop has been blamed on price decline on Umeme's counter.

Mr Bwiso said currently, there are 27,000 shareholders who have Securities Central Depositary accounts out of the 100,000 shareholders that have been registered by the different brokerage firms since the creation of the stock exchange.

Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda, who launched the automated trading system, said: ""As government, we shall look to seek the options of rising funding for our long term infrastructure projects through long term bonds that are listed on the Uganda Securities Exchange.""

Dr Rugunda said government will support the Capital Markets to enable it stimulate capital mobilisation to meet the long term investment desire of Ugandans and international investors.

Explaining the importance of stock exchange, he said USE contributes to wealth development, financial services and provides a platform for investment for local and foreign investors. Through this platform, companies can raise relatively cheaper long term capital and facilitates the secondary trading of shares.

""Capital Markets are therefore a vital engine of economic growth because they have a profound impact on the rate at which our economy grows and create jobs as they form the backbone of our stock market and ensure a stable fair and efficient market structure,"" he said.

A delegation led by Foreign Ministry Director General Dore Gold visited Cairo Wednesday for an official ceremony marking the re-opening of the embassy. 

“Under the leadership of PM Benjamin Netanyahu and the President of Egypt, Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, we have succeeded in pushing off the threats and we are working together in order to bring stability and economic prosperity to the Middle East,” Gold is quoted in the statement as saying. 

“Egypt will always be the biggest and most important country in our region, and it is no wonder that in the Arab world, people are accustomed to calling Egypt ‘The mother of the world.’ “ 

On September 9, 2011, thousands of protesters tore down a protective wall surrounding the Israeli Embassy and ransacked the embassy offices. In response, Israel pulled its diplomatic staff out of Egypt. A month earlier, Israeli soldiers killed five Egyptian police officers when Israel went after militants who had attacked civilians near the Israeli-Egyptian border.

18a9fe58-e56a-4b62-b858-0fecc3f3629a,"Dear Mr. Berko: What are your thoughts on interest rates? Will the Federal Reserve raise them this year or not? And if the Fed were to raise rates, how badly do you think it would hurt the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund, which is my largest individual investment and is 55 percent of my equity portfolio. And this worries me. -- WP, Syracuse, N.Y. 

  

Dear WP: Some wise observers believe that the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates this year, but some equally wise observers believe the Fed won't raise rates in 2015. I think it's a tossup, perhaps a 50-50 chance that the Fed will or won't -- which reminds me of my 50-50-90 rule. Most times when I have a 50-50 chance of making the right decision, there's a 90 percent probability that I'll pick the wrong one. 

I don't know whether Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will raise rates this year, and frankly, I doubt that she knows what she's going to do. However, I've been told that Yellen is facing steady pressure from the Obama administration and some members of Congress to maintain the current low rates. They're concerned that higher rates would translate to higher borrowing costs for municipalities, corporations and consumers. And they're concerned that higher rates would stifle demand and raise prices for goods and services, causing a drop in our gross domestic product. 

The Fed's policy of low rates is one of the two primary reasons your SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY-$193) has more than doubled since 2009. The other reason, of course, is the gusher of trillions of easy dollars with which the Fed has flooded the economy. Some market seers believe that a slow shift to higher rates would not presage a market decline or burke the continuing bull market. Rather, it might mean that the Fed believes the economy is healthy and can constructively absorb higher borrowing costs. 

 
 
	 
But as I pointed out in an earlier column, the acolytes of Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman have a low opinion of the Fed's timing and disagree. Yellen strongly believes that if rates were raised, continuing gains in employment would increase consumer buying power and businesses would be able to raise prices significantly. Apparently, the majority of Fed governors agree with Yellen. 

And history confirms this. Since the S&P 500 index was launched in 1957, there have been 14 instances in which the Fed has bumped short-term rates; and the average annual return, including dividends, during those years has been 9.51 percent.

59671c28-8a20-43d4-b6ed-bef9bc911c0d,"( Family Features ) A beautiful lawn can be the foundation to a happy, healthier life and lead to spending more time outdoors. In fact, 86 percent of Americans consider their lawn important to their home and life. 
  
“A healthy lawn encourages you to live life outside more with your family, friends and neighbors,” said Dr. Kirk Hurto, Chief Science Officer, TruGreen. “There’s no time like late summer and early fall to start preparing your yard for those spring and summertime outdoor gatherings.” 
 
While a recent survey conducted by TruGreen showed that seven out of 10 Americans believe themselves to be knowledgeable about the health of their yard, the lawn care experts at TruGreen offer these helpful reminders to get your yard ready for fall: 
 
Aerating 
 
Aeration involves removal of soil cores to improve water and air movement in compacted soils, and aids in promoting deeper and more root growth and thatch management. Long term, your lawn will respond quicker to fertilizer and water runoff will be reduced when irrigating.    
 
Overseeding 
 
When it comes to increasing lawn thickness and health, overseeding can be essential. It can help discourage future weeds while also aiding recovery from summer heat, disease and insect activity. Seeding during late summer or early fall will give grass the maximum time to develop a deep extensive root system and mature before the onset of winter stresses. Aeration is recommended when overseeding to give seeds more soil contact and provide a moist, protected environment required for germination. 
 
Feeding 
 
Fall feeding gives your landscape the nutrients needed to prepare for a healthy, green spring revival. Hiring a trained specialist with a plan customized to your region will help trees and shrubs thrive. If you fertilize your own lawn, make sure to follow the product directions and sweep all fertilizer that may reach pavement back onto your lawn. 
 
Maintaining Health and Appearance 
 
Throughout the fall, there are things you can do to maintain your yard’s appearance and health, Remove fallen tree leaves and debris from your lawn. Studies have shown mulching tree leaves back into your lawn effectively clears away tree leaf debris that otherwise can become matted and damage your lawn over the winter. Lowering the mower height by one or two settings the last couple mowings before winter reduces grass diseases associated with snow. Avoid walking on frost-covered lawns as doing so may cause brown footprints to appear later that can remain visible until spring. Clean and edge landscape beds, leaving no more than 2-3 inches of mulch in the beds. 
 
Pruning 
 
Pruning is an essential maintenance practice for trees and shrubs. Landscapes can quickly become overgrown if not cared for, but yearly pruning will maintain trees and shrubs to an ideal size and shape. Remove dead or damaged branches from trees and shrubs to prevent rot organisms from invading the trunk and stems of plants.

Today, top executives from marine container terminals and supply chain       experts are gathering in Hamburg to discuss the greatest challenges that       the shipping industry is experiencing at this year’s JOC       Container Trade Europe Conference. Chris Mazza, VP and Chief       Customer Officer at XVELA,       a cloud-based vessel stowage and collaboration platform for ocean       carriers and terminal operators, will be moderating a panel discussion       titled: “Seaports: the Next Great Bottleneck in International       Shipping” on Wednesday, September 23, at 3:15 PM CET . The panel       includes industry experts: 
 Dominik Landa, Commercial Director, DCT Gdansk SA  Yves Letange, Managing Director Europe, BDP International  Andreas Mrozek, Global Head of Marine And Terminal Operations, Hamburg         SUD  Martina Fontanet, Senior Advisor for Port and Maritime Policy,         Competition and Statistics, European Sea Ports Organization  
The panel will discuss how the ports are becoming an increasing       liability for container shippers. Today’s ports weren’t built for       20,000-TEU ships, and they struggle to handle them. When a port doesn’t       handle a ship productively, the vessel encounters delays at subsequent       ports, and imports and exports arrive or leave late. In short, that       means most of the productivity gains mega-ships achieve at sea unravel       during port operations. Some technology is improving the flow of       containers in and out of large European ports, but analysts increasingly       believe a quantum leap in port productivity is needed or efficiency will       deteriorate at ports, leading to further delays for containerized cargo. 
 
Chris Mazza has over 25 years of experience in the container shipping       industry and related technology. Prior to joining XVELA Chris was the       Chief Commercial Officer of International Asset systems responsible for       sales, marketing and business development and has done business with all       of the top 20 ocean carriers. 
 
Chris Mazza will be available for interviews throughout the conference,       so please reach out to the Brittany Bevacqua, bbevacqua@affect.com,       for any and all inquiries.

def60219-2d6d-4192-af9c-018f5940aaeb,"(CNN) 

Speaker John Boehner's future was on Rep. Henry Cuellar's mind when he was speaking with fellow House Democrats last week. 

The question they were mulling: Would they throw Boehner a lifeline and save his job if he needed their votes to survive? 

""Heck yes!"" Cuellar said in an interview when asked if he'd consider it. 
 
The Texas Democrat is one of more than a dozen House Democrats who told CNN they'd be willing to vote to keep Boehner in place if he faces a rebellion from the tea party wing of his caucus this fall. In interviews, a number of Democrats said they would use the dilemma as leverage to demand Boehner take a list of unspecified actions before casting a vote to spare his speakership. 

The openness of Democrats to help the Ohio Republican could give Boehner more breathing room as he faces a revolt from roughly two-dozen House conservatives who are plotting how to boot him from his position because, they believe, he has not taken a more confrontational line with President Barack Obama. 

""If you look clinically at every instance in which John Boehner was in trouble with his own caucus, you'll notice that Democrats were always there to put things over the top,"" said Rep. Steve Israel, a New York Democrat and close ally of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. ""I, for one, would work with him so long as he's doing the right thing for the country and meeting us half-way on the values and priorities that we have."" 

But Democratic support could further damage Boehner's standing among conservative members of the rank-and-file. 

It's unclear when a vote over Boehner's future may occur. Rep. Mark Meadows, a conservative North Carolina Republican, offered a resolution before the August recess to ""vacate the chair,"" a rarely invoked move that could threaten Boehner's speakership. If the speaker loses more than 29 GOP votes, he would be short of the 218 votes needed to hold the gavel -- unless Democrats voted to keep him in the chair. 

Maneuvering 

Boehner already lost 25 votes at the beginning of the year, and conservative foes to the speaker are maneuvering to drive that number higher. 

How Democrats proceed will be dictated in large part by Pelosi, who aides said has not yet discussed the matter at length with her inner leadership circle. Pelosi has shown the ability to work with Boehner, including earlier this year when the two cut a major deal to overhaul how physicians treating Medicare patients are paid. And many Democrats suspect she'd be willing to extend an olive branch to Boehner in exchange for concessions from the Ohio Republican. 

Speaking to reporters after a White House meeting last week, Pelosi punted when asked how she would address the matter. 

""I don't have any comment on that, but I do say that I have to get back for votes,"" Pelosi said. 

Boehner's office dismissed the talk. 

""The speaker isn't going anywhere,"" said Emily Schillinger, a Boehner spokeswoman. ""He's focused on the American people's priorities and how we can accomplish them."" 

If Democrats were to save Boehner's job, it would likely have major implications on how he runs the chamber. He would have to decide whether to basically ignore the conservative agitators in this caucus, namely in the House Freedom Caucus, and work more closely with Democrats. That, however, would be a significant challenge given how liberal the House Democratic Caucus has become in recent years. 

But the Democratic calculation to save Boehner comes down to this: Whether their party would benefit politically from having a weakened Boehner atop the House or whether a more conservative speaker would alienate middle-of-the-road voters and bolster their uphill climb to return to the majority in 2016. 

The speaker's allies don't think he will need Democratic support to keep his job, arguing that there are no obvious successors who would step forward. They also note Boehner has a reservoir of goodwill that runs deep through the GOP Conference. 

Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Florida, said he ""firmly"" believes Boehner could keep his speakership with just Republican votes. 

'Firing your coach' 

""In football, it's kind of like firing your coach mid-season,"" Rooney said. ""If you keep doing that, you're going to have a perpetual loser."" 

But at the beginning of the year, Boehner lost 25 votes -- and that was before this fall's session, which is full of hot-button fights bound to prompt more anger from the right-wing of his conference. Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, and Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, for instance, both voted for the speaker in January but did not rule out voting to boot him from the job this fall. 

Michigan GOP Rep. Justin Amash, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, said ""there would be more than enough"" GOP votes to fire Boehner, ""so it would really depend on the Democratic side"" to keep him. 

""We haven't had real leadership over the last several years,"" Amash said. 

Added Virginia Rep. Dave Brat, who ousted the former majority leader, Eric Cantor, in a GOP primary last year: ""I ran on principles, and this year has not been a good year for us."" 

The leadership drama comes at a critical juncture for the GOP-led Congress. Government funding expires Oct. 1, and Republican leaders are scrambling to avoid the second shutdown in as many years. The sticking point revolves around annual funding that goes to Planned Parenthood, the abortion rights organization that conservatives are vowing to strip of federal money. 

With Obama threatening to veto any spending bill that attempts to gut Planned Parenthood, Boehner is in a jam, hoping to avoid a politically damaging shutdown without angering the right flank of his party. To circumvent the blowback, GOP leaders are trying to orchestrate a complicated series of steps to keep government coffers filled -- starting with action this week in the Senate -- and putting the Planned Parenthood fight on a separate track so it doesn't become entangled in a must-pass funding bill. 

But even if Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, are able to keep the government open, it will only be a short-term victory. 

Cutting deals 

In the fall, GOP leaders are going to have to cut a deal with the White House on a long-term spending bill until October 2016, a debt limit increase and funding for highway programs. Moreover, renewing the charter for the controversial Export-Import Bank, which is reviled by conservative groups but backed by the business community, is awaiting action this fall. 

The landmines have Democrats waiting for an opportunity to exert their power. 

""I would not rule it out,"" said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, when asked if he would vote for Boehner. ""We don't know what opportunity might arise."" 

""I think it is a conversation that we ought to have with our leadership,"" said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois. ""Things can always be worse."" 

Rep. Elijah Cummings, the 11-term Maryland Democrat, said that the caucus would have to be united on its approach to the situation. 

""When you look at our position, that is being in the minority and looking like we will be there for a while, every opportunity we get, I think we have to at least try to bring our votes together to affect change,"" Cummings said. ""Our power will be sticking together."" 

Indeed, that's one reason why Cuellar has begun having some informal discussions with his colleagues. He said that Texas could serve as a model for Boehner. In 2009, Texas Democrats joined with Republicans to elect Joe Straus as statehouse speaker, a moderate Republican who has battled more conservative members of his caucus and faced challenges from the right. 

In the U.S. House, Cuellar said, Democrats could do the same thing. 

""Coming from Texas, I've seen this process work before,"" Cuellar said. ""I would rather have Boehner than some far winger, if that's the choice.""",House Dems willing to save John Boehner,News,RGVProud,2015-09-22T00:45:46Z

TALLAHASSEE, Florida — Two Republican state senators are defending a proposal to redraw boundaries to Florida's congressional districts. 
 
Sen. Tom Lee and Sen. Bill Galvano both testified on Friday during a trial that could decide the state's political landscape. After the trial is over, a judge will recommend a new map for the 27 districts. 
 
The Florida Supreme Court in July threw out eight districts and ordered legislators to draw new boundaries. But the House and Senate deadlocked in August during a special session over a new map. 
 
Lee testified about his involvement in drawing up a map that would alter districts in the Tampa Bay region. The Brandon Republican said he wanted to keep most of eastern Hillsborough County in one district. But Lee's motives have been questioned.

6d998f3a-ffb9-4e99-983e-5159e6eabe73,"AFTER over a decade of demands from Shekou residents and deputies of the Shenzhen Municipal People’s Congress, the Dongjiaotou oil and gas depot in Shekou had most of its flammable stock removed. 

The depot stored things like diesel, petroleum and liquefied petroleum for several local firms. 

The recent move is partly linked to the deadly blasts in Tianjin that killed at least 158 Aug. 12. It was also spurred by a decade of complaints from the depot’s surrounding residential estates. 

According to the Daily Sunshine yesterday, 8.5 tons of natural gas was emptied into barrels belonging to Shennan Gas on Aug. 25. Sinopec followed suit, moving 9,400 tons of petrol materials three days later. 

Shenyan Gas reduced its gas storage from 1,650 tons down to 1,100 tons. Shenyan is currently supplying 30 percent of the liquefied gas consumed by nearby residents. 

The company decided to reduce the amount of gas stored at the site slowly, with a plan to halt operation completely before the end of October. 

The removal and relocation were carried out Aug. 21 by a specialist team in Nanshan District. 

The relocation of the Dongjiaotou oil and gas depot is part of a citywide inspection of the storage of oil, gas and dangerous chemicals. 

The Qingshuihe oil depot in Luohu District was closed and six tankers were emptied last week. A large-scale liquefied petroleum gas storage and distribution station was located in the Qingshuihe oil depot area. In August 1993, an explosion in Qingshuihe claimed 15 lives and seriously injured 100 people. The blast was caused by the illegal storage of hazardous chemicals.(Zhang Xiaoyi)",SHEKOU OIL AND GAS DEPOT PARTIALLY EMPTIED,News,Shenzhen Daily,2015-09-01T05:18:39Z
4e712cb7-a1b3-4f29-b7f3-ff42d44cdaac,"Australia's tax reform debate has become so plagued by a handful of myths that we are losing the ability to prevent our living standards falling, Deloitte Access Economics has warned. Australia's tax reform debate has become so plagued by a handful of myths that we are losing the ability to prevent our living standards falling, Deloitte Access Economics has warned. Three contentious tax issues – bracket creep, the GST, and company tax cuts – need to be far better understood by Australians because they hold the key to faster productivity growth and rising living standards, the group says.

If we don't re-jig our tax system by fixing bracket creep, raising the GST, and cutting company taxes, then our stagnating living standards may decline.

The group of ex-Treasury officials and tax experts has published a new report, called Shedding light on the debate: Myth-busting tax reform, that tries to explain the truth about those reform proposals and persuade Australians that we ought to pursue them.

Most of its recommendations will be welcomed by Treasurer Joe Hockey, who has been arguing for the need to fix bracket creep and cut company taxes.

Deloitte Access Economics director Chris Richardson says he hopes the report will be used as a source in future discussions on tax reform.

""Reforms to all three [tax issues] are vital. But they are dogged by misconceptions that just won't die,"" Mr Richardson says.

""Australia can lift productivity in a variety of ways, but an important channel to greater prosperity is tax reform … unless and until Australia lifts its productivity performance, we risk a prolonged period of stagnation compared with our past performance on prosperity.""

The report says Australians' understanding of bracket creep – the process whereby taxpayers are pushed into higher tax brackets as their wages rise over time – is clouded by two myths.

Firstly, there is a misconception that 80 per cent of the Abbott government's budget repair task is being done by bracket creep when the reality is that bracket creep will contribute only 10 per cent of the government's revenue growth by 2018-19, it says.

""Why is the myth wrong? Because the engine that powers bracket creep is wage growth, and wage growth in Australia is at record lows,"" the report says.

""Far and away the biggest driver of Treasury's forecasts of a higher tax take, accounting for more than 70 per cent of the increase, is simply the economy gets bigger over time as prices and the economy grows.""

There is also a myth that bracket creep hurts middle income families most, when it actually hurts low income families more than anyone.

On the GST, the report says it is a myth that an increase will punish the poor.

""That myth ignores the bleeding obvious: we can raise pensions and benefits and tweak the personal tax system to keep the less well-off at least no worse than now.""

On company tax cuts, the report says the issue is clouded by two myths – that such cuts would ""just be welfare for plutocrats"", and that we ought to wait for the economy to improve before we can afford them.

""The key determinant of which taxes we should cut first is the damage they do to the economy, and Treasury and other economists rank company taxes among Australia's most damaging taxes,"" the report says.

""A lower company tax rate benefits Australians by providing more growth, investment, employment and higher living standards.""

The report counters the argument by the Grattan Institute that bracket creep is accounting for 80 per cent of the federal government's budget repair task.

966e3d28-2ae0-4799-805f-20da941d4941,"10:37am        
TORONTO - The union representing Ontario's public elementary teachers says it has not been given the same contract offer as their colleagues in high schools and the Catholic system. 

The Elementary Teachers Federation is stepping up its work-to-rule campaign today and threatening to move to one-day rotating strikes if it doesn't have a tentative agreement within two weeks. 

ETFO president Sam Hammond says the government has not offered elementary teachers the same conditions as their high school colleagues. 

Hammond says there's a ""significant disparity"" in how the two levels of schools are funded, which he insists leads to larger class sizes, fewer student supports and poorer working conditions in elementary schools. 

Talks with the elementary teachers' union broke off over a week ago and Hammond says the only way to get a fair deal is to return to bargaining. 

The Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation and the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association last week ratified deals that contained raises of 1.5 per cent plus another one-per-cent bonus. 

The union representing teachers in Francophone schools have also reached a tentative agreement, leaving ETFO as the only teachers' union without a contract. 

""If the Liberal government had stayed at the table and not walked away, it's possible we could have reached a deal by now, and the escalation of ETFO's work-to-rule could have been avoided,"" Hammond said in a release. 

The Canadian Union of Public Employees is also trying to negotiate a new contract for 50,000 non-teaching staff in Ontario schools.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Barnes & Noble (BKS - Get Report ) are higher by 6.53% to $12.57 on strong volume in mid-morning trading on Thursday, one day after the stock declined following the company's fiscal 2016 first quarter financial results. 

The entertainment products and books seller saw a weak quarter with a fifth consecutive quarterly decline in revenue and a wider than expected net loss. 

Store closures, a reduction in NOOK e-reader sales and a slump in online sales all negatively impacted results for the most recent quarter. 

Additionally, Barnes & Noble announced today that it has partnered up with Maker Media the publisher of Maker Magazine and the producer of Maker Faire to launch the first ever Mini Maker Fair in its stores across the country.

""We rate BARNES & NOBLE INC (BKS) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed – some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income and notable return on equity. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including weak operating cash flow and poor profit margins."" 

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: 

BARNES & NOBLE INC has improved earnings per share by 48.6% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. This trend suggests that the performance of the business is improving. During the past fiscal year, BARNES & NOBLE INC turned its bottom line around by earning $0.12 versus -$1.27 in the prior year.

fe12fe2c-a59d-4750-884f-18563b008b49,"Communication exchanges between pensioners living in the diaspora show that more than 350 have not been receiving their pensions. Each of them is owed more than $14,000 in arrears, translating to over $5 million. 
 
When those that have migrated to South Africa are added, the figure doubles to more than $10 million, according to one senior citizen living in the UK. “This amounts to a withholding fraud of around $10 million worth of stolen global diasporan pensioners’ funds,” said a Zimbabwean based in the UK. This figure does not take into account those that migrated to countries other than the UK and South Africa. 
The pensioners left the country for various reasons, which included fleeing the violent land “reform” programme, migrating out of fear they could be harmed or following those who took care of them in old age. 
 
They have urged western aid providers to reconsider their assistance to Zimbabwe in the wake of the state’s failure to pay the pensions. 
 
“It seems clear now that Zimbabwe’s western aid in general, and UK aid in particular, needs to be looked at afresh and with honesty. Not to do so effectively continues to reward criminal behaviour, thus making the overseas aid agencies accomplices in the fraud.  It is quite clear that the Zimbabwe pensions administrative structure is simply not competent to either honestly or effectively deliver on its lawful mandate,” said another pensioner. 
 
Massive fraud 
The Zimbabwean recently revealed massive fraud at the Pension Office where officers, particularly from the army, were conniving with bank officials to steal late pensioners’ money. 
 
A pensions office notice dated September 14 requires pensioners to fill in a life certificate for the department to ascertain if they were still alive. This is the third such request in the last 10 years and, according to the pensioners, most of them have not been paid despite filling the forms. 
 
All civil service pensioners must register by end of October or their pensions would be forfeited. They feared that the pension office did not want to pay them out by introducing too many demands. 
 
“To introduce a now third exercise of proving we are alive is both scandalous and cruel. The last one was not without considerable cost and effort. To ask the still unpaid pensioners abroad to jump through the same hoop again is simply unacceptable,” said one pensioner. 
President Robert Mugabe recently appointed a pensions commission headed by retired judge George Smith. 
 
“You will only be able to get the information after the ongoing meeting of commissioners,” said Smith. Local pensioners have also been crying foul over a long time, complaining that they are getting too little or no money at all.

7bd5d973-b0ab-4939-a74b-5f1ff5aa724c,"CHENNAI: The Madras high court has rejected the anticipatory bail petition of R Subramanian, who founded the Subhiksha retail store chain along with several other financial companies and is accused of cheating depositors of around 250 crore. The chain of stores has closed down. 

The economic offences wing had registered a case against Subramanian for cheating and criminal breach of trust in October 2013. The scam was unearthed was after G Ramadoss filed a complaint saying after investing around 6.6 lakh in a scheme, his payment cheques were dishonoured. 

On Friday, Justice V Ramasubramanian said since the date of filing of FIR, Subramanian was ""in enjoyment of one protective order or the other, either in form of stay of all further proceedings, or in the form of protection from arrest"". But, after the orders were lifted in August, police had to step up investigation. All other accused in the case were granted bail. 

Earlier this month, the court had asked Subramanian to furnish details to prove his ability to repay debenture holders. However, a clear picture regarding the veracity of his commitments had not emerged. Police and the depositors' association ""were of the strong view that unless Subramanian was taken into custody, a clear picture would not emerge"". So anticipatory bail could not be granted, said the judge.",Subhiksha retail store chain owner denied bail by HC,News,Times of India,2015-09-18T20:31:46Z

0f2ad63b-75d7-42a6-a0dd-232168838703,"Amid the collapse of her business last year, Retail Adventures, Kathmandu founder Jan Cameron made a fateful decision, it has now cost her $200 million. 

The Bellamy Organic boys and girls have had their golden shackles removed more than a year after its ASX float at $1 a share.

And boy (and girl) they must be glad they were prevented from selling into the China story that has continued to defy gravity.

The 17.567 million shares - owned by a group that includes Bellamy chief executive, Laura McBain and chairman Robert Woolley - have jumped in value from $17.56 million to more than $105 million in just over a year.

But this is chump change when you look at the agonising story of the one that got away.

Last year, Kathmandu founder Jan Cameron was on the board and she was also Bellamy's largest investor.

But she was still suffering the fallout of the collapse of Retail Adventures.

It cost her a bomb. Cameron estimates that the failed adventure cost her $200 million - and it almost certainly led to her leaving the Bellamy's board, and selling her shares before the IPO.

Cameron offloaded 36.557 million shares at a dollar a piece. They are now worth around $226 million.

She is also missing out on extra boardroom perks. According to Bellamy's AGM notice its directors are seeking a 67 per cent pay rise, taking the board's remuneration pool from $600,000 to a cool $1 million. Spilt milk

Speaking of dairy.

CBD is counting down the days to the Harvey Norman AGM this year to see if Gerry Harvey's detour into dairy causes more of a stir than the tea and coffee this year.

""If you want to put your money into a safe and boring company without any entrepreneurial skills then you should go somewhere else,"" was the billionaire retailer's message to the markets which sunk the stock below $4 following last week's announcement.

It sounds like either retail is going to continue to do it tough, or Gerry is getting bored with the same-old, same-old.

At least investors can't complain that he does not have their best interests at heart.

Gerry's only financial interest in Coomboona will be via the 49 per cent stake being acquired through his retailer.

Gerry even said he would have been happy to acquire the interest himself, had the Harvey Norman board given the deal the thumbs down.

CBD is not sure if Gerry is heading off any potential shareholder insurrection this November by shoring up his own votes, or he just sees another bargain in the share price weakness.

For the second time in a week he waded into the market to buy shares. He pocketed another 1.2 million shares for just under $5 million. Charity Road 

Not everyone chooses a rubber chicken lunch, or, strap on a guitar, in the name of charity.

CBD's hat goes off to the organisers of the 2015 Bullrush Rally ""a 2000km super car road trip down the east coast of Australia"" over five nights which ended in Melbourne on Saturday.

""Over five action-packed nights, entrants will look forward to driving breathtaking roads with over 30 super cars, building friendships over dinner at some of Australia's top restaurants, partying at the most exclusive venues, and pitting car against car, driver against driver, in a competitive yet fun environment at the Sydney Dragway.""

And after all of this tedious, but necessary fun was had, all proceeds went to the Starlight Children's Foundation.

CBD must admit this sounds like our idea of a charity event with Lamborghinis, Porsches and Ferraris being the chariots of choice.

Participants include Finsure co-founder John Kolenda, who was obviously trying to stand out from the pack in his gull-winged Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG.

There was also Rodney Michail, the Gold Coast car dealer who founded insurance broker 1800 Approved.

His team sported a Maserati GranTurismo.

CBD wonders if he is the same Rodney Michail who used to own a classic 2005 Aston Martin DB9 Volante V12.

According to reports, Michail wrote it off after driving off a Gold Coast boat ramp in 2011 into the drink while trying to retrieve a dropped cigarette.

It proved to be an expensive ciggy when the insurer refused to pay up.

You might think their phone and gadgets are covered  against damage, through programs like Apple Care. 

But that's not necessarily the case. And it's important information whether or not you have kids in school. 

Students Loaded Down with Gadgets 

Move-in day at college means carloads of suitcases, boxes, TV's, and laptops. 

Many of these students have a lot of electronic gadgets to keep safe, and told us they have laptop locks, along with various extended warranties, like Apple Care. 

But while both are good to have, they may still not be enough. A basic repair for a dropped device can run $250 or more. 

Almost all extended warranties will cover against breakdown, but they may not cover against breakage. And they almost always won't cover if your gadget is lost or stolen. 

Erin Pace learned that the hard way, when her new iPhone 6 was recently stolen. 

""It would cost me $650 for a new iPhone 6 because I am not eligible for an upgrade and I don't have a protection plan,"" she lamented. 

Ways to Protect Your Gadget 

The tech site ZD Net recently compared warranties. 

It suggests 3rd party companies as best, such as Square Trade or Protect Your Bubble.com . 

I did a check of my devices, and Square Trade offered me 2 years of damage protection for a $700 laptop, for a one-time payment of $99. 

Or you can insure your smartphone for $4 to $8 a month, depending on the brand. 

As for loss or theft, the best solution is to add your device to a homeowner's or renter's policy, which is what college Junior Kendall Wright has done. 

""I have renter's insurance through Sallie Mae, for about $200 a year,"" she said, ""which guarantees if anything happens to my laptop (or other possessions), it's taken care of."" 

Several other breakage plans are worth considering, such as those offered by Verizon, AT&T, or even Amazon, which sells a plan called Canopy. 

3 Best Plans 

So the bottom line?  Make sure you have one of these protection plans for any device you carry: 

- A 3rd party protection plan from a site like SquareTrade, ProtectYourBubble, or Canopy 

- Damage coverage from your carrier 

- Renter's or homeowner's insurance that will cover loss or damage 

With smartphones and laptops now averaging $600, insuring them is smart advice in this dangerous world. 

That way you don't waste your money.

Yes, she has her two children, her Super Bowl-champion husband and her physical beauty that make her ""rich"" in life, just generally. But she's also rich rich, like actually rich. 
 
Bunchen — who is not even a model any more, having very publicly retired in April — is on track to make $44 million this year rich, according to a newly released study by  of the richest female supermodels. Nobody else is even close. 
 
The Brazilian icon has turned her fabulous looks into an industry, earning an estimated $386 million during her long and lucrative career. She has lent her name to sandals and skincare and created the skincare line Sejaa Pure Skincare. 
 
Coming in second — and we mean a distant second — are Cara Delevingne and Adriana Lima with $9 million each. Doutzen Kroes is fourth with $7.5 million; Natalia Vodianova is fifth with $7 million; Miranda Kerr and Joan Smalls are sixth with $5.5 million. 
 
Together, those models earned a projected $43.5 million combined — less than Gisele made in a year. 
 
Bundchen's income is actually expected to tick down just a bit, since she made $47 million in 2014. That could be due in part to Gisele's decision in April to retire from the catwalk. 
   
So who might someday unseat Bundchen as the highest-earning supermodel? 
 
Newcomer Kendall Jenner, who has many years of earning ahead of her and a business-savvy mom, would seem to have a shot. 
 
Jenner has burst onto the modeling scene recently and is on her way to earning $4 million this year, according to . 
 
That's not Bundchen money, but at only 19 years old, Jenner's star is rising fast.

It creates 3.25 lakh man days against target of 2.97 lakh 

Bidar district has overshot the target of creating man days under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) this year. It has created 3.25 lakh man days against the target of 2.97 lakh till July this year. 

Officials say this has been achieved due to creation of awareness among the public, setting achievable targets to officials and timely release of wages to labourers. 

The Panchayat Development Officers have been asked to immediately start minimum five wage-based works in each gram panchayat and aim at 50 individual works. 

PDOs should hold meetings with labour representatives and MNREGA officials such as engineers and horticulture officers; prepare muster rolls weekly and intimate the labourers; and should monitor work closely and ensure it adheres to the guidelines and standards set in the scheme. All labourers should get weekly wage payment, and all these steps should be updated on the MNREGA portal every day. The number of labourers involved, the works taken up, payment and other details are regularly sent to the MNREGA directorate to ensure transparency. 

Assistant executive engineers at the taluk levels are also expected to attend the weekly gram panchayat meetings. Senior officials have been tasked with paying surprise visits to villages and monitor progress of civil works, ZP chief executive officer Sharat B. told The Hindu . 

He said that six PDOs who had failed to start MNREGA works in their area were suspended on the orders of the State government. As many as 46 PDOs who had served for five years in one place were reshuffled. 

Secondly, officials have been visiting villages to create awareness among poorer households about the benefits of MNREGA. This has also helped push up the number of volunteers. Labourers who want work can approach the helpline 1800 425 8666 or send an SMS with details of job card number and name of gram panchayat to the CEO (99167 77899).

1a8864bb-1281-485b-80c9-7e0ee574bd1c,"NEW DELHI: The Civil Aviation Ministry has no plans to remove the name of Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra from the elite ""no-frisking"" list at domestic airports. 

""We are not withdrawing Robert Vadra's name from the list. It is not on our radar,"" Minister of State for Civil Aviation Mahesh Sharma told PTI today. 

He was asked whether the Civil Aviation Ministry was taking Vadra's name off the ""no frisking"" list. 

As of now, Vadra is not frisked at airports if he travels with an SPG protectee. If he is removed from the elite list, he would be subjected to frisking at all airports even if he travels with an SPG protectee. The issue of Vadra's exemption from frisking and checking at airport has been raised many times. 

Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju had last year said that the no-frisking list should be meaningful and not ""ornamental"". 

The current no-frisk list includes the President, Vice President, Prime Minister, Union Cabinet ministers, Leader of Opposition, Supreme Court judges, high court chief justices, chief ministers and their deputies, governors and ambassadors. 

Those who are protected by the SPG, such as Vadra's wife Priyanka Gandhi and brother-in-law Rahul Gandhi, are also not frisked. 

The Home Ministry had recently asked the Civil Aviation Ministry to go ahead with its plan to review the list of 33 categories of people, including the Dalai Lama and Vadra. The Home Ministry had said it did not consider the threat perception to Vadra serious enough to warrant his inclusion in the no-frisking list but advised the Civil Aviation Ministry to take a final call after consultation with the Special Protection Group, which guards his wife Priyanka. 

The home ministry had reportedly left it to the aviation ministry to take a call on the issue as it was not in its ambit.",'No plan to take off Vadra from no-frisking list',News,Economic Times,2015-09-10T15:54:59Z

00e097f0-4c31-497d-9376-a04d65ea9290,"Roberto Martinez, pictured left, is a big fan of Swansea boss Garry Monk, right 

Everton boss Roberto Martinez feels no manager has had as big an influence on their club in recent times as his Swansea counterpart Garry Monk. 

Monk took charge at the Welsh outfit in February 2014 after Michael Laudrup's departure and three months later was handed a three-year deal with Barclays Premier League survival having been secured. 

In 2014-15 the club then achieved their highest-ever finish in the division of eighth - which led to another new contract for Monk - and they are currently in the same spot this term having made a decent start to the campaign, including a 2-1 win over Manchester United. 

Martinez played alongside and managed Monk at Swansea. 

And the Spaniard said on Thursday ahead Saturday's league clash between Everton and the Swans at the Liberty Stadium: ""I'm a big admirer of what Garry Monk has done. 

""I don't see another manager who has had such a big influence over the last three seasons - taking different roles, having to stabilise the team, giving them direction, and avoiding relegation. 

""He then had a full season and achieved their best-ever finish in the Premier League, and is now following that with a really strong start to this season with different personnel - for me, it has been a very, very impressive job he has done. 

""The team play with a strong philosophy, but they are very flexible and always competitive. 

""I think in the last game they played at home they deserved to beat Manchester United and that speaks volumes about where Swansea are and where they can go. You feel under Garry there are many good things ahead."" 

Asked if he still spoke to Monk much, Martinez added: ""No, because unfortunately a manager's life is very busy. 

""But I have incredible affection and respect for him. Whenever I see him it feels like you've never been out of touch."" 

Meanwhile, Martinez - whose side are seventh - has reported positive news on the fitness of Seamus Coleman and Muhamed Besic. 

Defender Coleman and midfielder Besic came off in Saturday's impressive 3-1 home victory over Chelsea due to hamstring problems, but Martinez said: ""Both are reacting really well to treatment. I wouldn't rule any of the two out for the next game."" 

Defender Bryan Oviedo (knee) is expected to be ready to make his return in Tuesday's Capital One Cup game at Reading, while it remains to be seen exactly when midfielder Darron Gibson's first-team comeback arrives after he featured for the Under-21s on Monday as he stepped up his recovery from a foot problem. 

That match, a 1-1 draw with Sunderland, saw Uruguayan forward Leandro Rodriguez score for a second successive under-21s fixture following his move from River Plate Montevideo last month. 

And asked on Thursday about the prospect of the 22-year-old featuring for the Everton first-team, Martinez said: ''I've been very impressed with him and I don't expect him to be too far away from being in contention.''",10:34Everton boss Roberto Martinez hails influence of Garry Monk at Swansea,News,Sligo Champion,2015-09-17T12:22:13Z

Amb Ukonga brought a copy of her organization's Treaty to the Commission. She also emphasized the importance of strengthening the collaboration between both institutions for the well-being of Africans. 
 
Two issues were raised during the meeting: The cooperation on maritime and blue economy issues, and the formalization of the relationship between the Commission and the Gulf of Guinea Commission, within the ambit of the GGC Treaty and the AU African Integrated Maritime Strategy 2050 (2050AIM). 
 
Amb Febe gave an overview of Agenda 2063 and the 2050 AIM Strategy, which focuses on Africa taking charge of all its natural resources, including its oceanic resources, to build shared prosperity for the continent and its citizens. She also pointed out that both programmes will involve partners -- private sector, regional organisations, and government - in the ownership and in the implementation aspects. The meeting discussed the challenges in the maritime domain such as the degradation of the natural environment, the illegal fishing and the impact on coastal livelihoods and nutrition, the oil and gas exploration and exploitation; and the protection of the maritime environment, as well the negative impact on the people and the nature. It stressed the importance of African solutions and cooperation to these continental challenges. 
 
Mr Samuel Kame-Domguia, coordinator of the 2050 Aim Strategy taskforce who attended the meeting expressed the personal involvement of Amb Ukonga in the elaboration of the 2050 AIM Strategy document. He encouraged this collaboration which he said would be continuously fruitful.

4145ac40-dc8f-4bc1-b514-54a7d10efd40,"HotelTap is enabling staff of this California hotel to communicate more efficiently via messaging 
 
[Alameda, Calif. — Sept. 15, 2015] — The LaQuinta Inn & Suites in Davis, Calif., is operating more efficiently and responding to guest requests quickly thanks to the HotelTap cloud-based workforce communications tool. Rolled out in July, the HotelTap ""digital log book in the cloud"" replaces hand-written notes as a means to communicate between staff, departments and management. As a result, tasks are being completed in real time, customers are happy, and staff are taking more pride in their work. 
 
Developed by Sandip Jariwala, owner of the Hawthorn Suites By Wyndham in Alameda, Calif., HotelTap was designed to respond to guest requests quickly, perform and track maintenance tasks efficiently, and resolve customer complaints timely using a social media network format (similar to Twitter or enterprise social software Yammer and Chatter). Leveraging mobile technology and the cloud, HotelTap communicates a steady stream of daily activities and information (in the users language of choice) in chronological order by department and by staff start time. The digital tool also contains a comprehensive analytical dashboard that records and tracks guest complaints and provides a snapshot of maintenance and equipment issues and task history relating to them, by category and physical areas of the hotel. The dashboard neatly organizes the property's complaint records so operators can easily pinpoint problem areas. The system offers alerts for tags so that managers and owners can be notified via text messages about particular issues as soon as they are entered in HotelTap. 
 
""HotelTap is making a huge difference in the way I run the LaQuinta Inn & Suites in Davis,"" said General Manager Kibir Messele. ""Doing my job -- and ensuring that everyone else is doing theirs -- is now a lot easier with HotelTap in place. I can relay information to staff who need to receive it to get their work done. When I delegate tasks, I know that they are being completed because I can access HotelTap online or from my mobile phone to track the progress."" 
 
Before HotelTap, Messele said it was standard operating procedure for staff to tape a note to his desk if there was an issue that needed addressed. The property also used a notebook to record guest requests or jot down complaints that needed management attention. 
 
""Hand-written notes worked okay for a while, but I was at the mercy of the person leaving the message; it's not easy to read everyone's handwriting,"" Messele said. ""It was also difficult to determine how urgent a message was based on the information provided. We tried an automated operating system that primarily dealt with customer payments and reservations, but it did little to help us communicate. Thankfully, Mr. Jariwala told our property owner about HotelTap. 
 
""There is no system in the hospitality market today that is tailored to workplace communications like HotelTap is,"" Messele added. ""Because this tool is similar to messaging on social media sites, it's easy to train staff to use. At first, our employees were skeptical, but today, everyone has embraced it and they are using it willfully because it is making their jobs easier too. As long as everyone is communicating, problems don't fall through the cracks. In a word, HotelTap is 'social' . . . 'smart' . . . and . . . 'convenient.'"" 
 
Messele said that maintenance and housekeeping staff can access HotelTap from a tablet or cell phone and get email or SMS notifications when new tasks are posted to their ""to do"" list. They can complete tasks during their shift and the front desk staff gets notified through HotelTap on their desktop. Notifications can also be turned off when staff is off duty. 
 
At the LaQuinta Inn and Suites Davis, the head housekeeper uses HotelTap in Spanish via tablet to complete daily room inspections. The tablet is then shared with maintenance staff to check off room inventory, record equipment readings, and also to check the PH levels at the pool. Keeping this data stored in HotelTap makes record keeping and retrieving easy, especially when property inspectors come by. In addition, the tablet can be used to take photos of damages in a room or items that were left behind. 
 
""I am delighted that the LaQuinta Inn and Suites Davis is having such tremendous success with HotelTap,"" Jariwala said. ""I created this solution to leverage mobile technology and the cloud to run my own hotel more efficiently. Like Mr. Messele, I struggled with interdepartmental communications. HotelTap puts a stop to owners and managers not receiving alerts in a timely manner. It also prevents negative online reviews popping up via the social media channels due to the absence of analytics for complaints and maintenance problems. Better yet, HotelTap's WaitList feature is increasing hotel revenues."" 
 
Jariwala explained that when the hotel is sold out for a particular day or days (especially during special events or conventions) and guests call to book a room, the front desk staff can create a task in HotelTap to put the guest on a wait list which shows up on the To Do list of the Front Desk board. Each day, the manager or staff will check the room availability chart to see if a room has opened up; if so, the wait listed guest will be called to book the reservation. 
 
""I encourage any hotel manager or owner who is also struggling with property communications to give HotelTap a call today,"" Jariwala said. ""I've been in your shoes . . . and believe me when I say, HotelTap can help.""

1b223a95-7437-431c-bfd4-efe85623b3cd,"Efforts to save endangered red squirrels are set to receive a £1.2 million boost from the Heritage Lottery Fund. 
 
Funding will go to support a four-year programme to secure the future of the native red, immortalised as ""Squirrel Nutkin"" by Beatrix Potter, across the UK. 
 
Red squirrels have vanished from most of England and Wales and from parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland as a result of the impact of non-native grey squirrels, introduced from America in the 19th century. 
 
Grey squirrels  out-compete the reds for resources and carry a squirrelpox disease that is fatal to the native species. 
 
The Red  Squirrels United coalition, led by The Wildlife Trusts, will work directly in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and with the Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels partnership in cross-border action in a bid to reverse the fortunes of the charismatic mammal. 
 
The project will involve culling grey squirrels to preserve existing areas which are free of the non-native species,  for example on the island of Anglesey and in Kielder Forest, and protect conifer woodland habitat where red squirrels thrive and greys do not. 
 
It will extend existing red squirrel ""protection zones"" in mid-Wales and Merseyside and take a whole country approach to preserving the native reds in Northern Ireland. 
 
Co mmunity-based rapid response teams will be set up involving 1,250 volunteers trained to protect key red squirrel populations threatened by coming into contact with greys, with measures to humanely trap and shoot the grey squirrels. 
 
The scheme's backers said all conservation work to protect the red squirrels would be rigorously monitored and would contribute to scientific research. 
 
Stehpanie Hilborne, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: ""Our beautiful native red squirrels deserve our protection in every part of the UK where they can still thrive.

""This investment will allow us to unite hundreds of people championing this charismatic creature into one UK force for good. It will build on decades of hard work and passionate commitment.""

Blytheville school board approves pay raise for employees of the district. 

Monday the school board met and agreed to add $1.25 to all employee's pay, except the superintendent and bus drivers. 

The bus drivers received a pay raise in the summer to help get more drivers for the district. 

Employees of the school district will receive a check with the additional money from their work in July to October. 

Then starting in November the pay raise will go straight into the employees' pay checks. 

Superintendent Richard Atwill said the school has not done a pay raise in a while and he is pleased the board approved the raises.

91e6fe2d-039c-4a78-bd46-a9ee80d23317,"AFTER nine years as headteacher at Highwoods Primary School, Nigel Hookway is retiring next summer. 
 
It will mark the end of a career which will have spanned 37 years. 
 
In this time, he has risen through the ranks to lead his own school and won the title of Primary Headteacher of the Year in the first Essex Teaching Awards in 2014. 
 
He accepted the award humbly. 
 
Mr Hookway, 58, went to school in Harwich and did his teacher training in Brighton in 1976. 
 
His first job as a teacher was in Worthing in 1979 where he had a class of 44 children, and no technology. 
 
One of his favourite teaching experiences was working abroad at the Algarve in Portugal in 1982. 
 
He taught there for two years with his wife, Annie, who is a headteacher in Suffolk. 
 
Mr Hookway said he was encouraged to become a head teacher after serving as a deputy head at Springfield Junior School in Ipswich. 
 
He said: “I came back to Colchester 25 years after I left to go to college to be head of Hazelmere Junior School until 2007. 
 
“I wanted to be head of a primary school and I knew this school had potential.” 
 
In all his years of teaching, the nature of the pupils has not changed. 
   Promoted stories   
He said: “Children themselves have not changed a great deal apart from the pressures placed upon them to achieve more. 
 
“There was no Ofsted when I started out.” 
 
He said one of the biggest changes is with technology which, he said, has aided learning enormously. 
 
But play times – and learning through doing – are still important. 
 
He said: “It’s not just about passing exams. We take the children sailing and water rafting. 
 
“We went to Harwich on an art project. I could tell the children all about my home town.” 
 
“I love outdoor life and I like to share experiences of tenacity and resilience in school. 
 
“They see me as a grandfather figure. School flies by and I want them to enjoy their time as much as possible.” 
 
Time, too, has flown for him and he said he will find it hard to say goodbye to the school. 
 
He said: “I’m going to miss the day-to-day contact with colleagues. 
 
“I will miss the children doing things like eating a bowl of mud soup made in our mud kitchen. 
 
“It seems like nothing, but to me it is so important.” 
 
Having so much responsibility has been tough, but Mr Hookway said he would not change his experience. 
 
He said: “I don’t want the children to grow up too quickly. If they do not experience mud pies and falling out of trees, they are not going to become balanced adults. 
 
“The responsibility is hard, I won’t sugar coat it, especially when families are going through a hard time. 
 
“Even when I go home the school is always in the back of my mind.” 
 
One of his greatest achievements at the school was obtaining two good Ofsted reports. 
 
Mr Hookway now intends to do inspections for Ofsted, and some consultancy work. 
 
He said: “I need to balance work and life, so I want to spend time working on my new home. 
 
“I would quite like to have dogs again so I can go for walks along the beach.”

0e0ce2ef-e4a4-4deb-995f-0abc2ef0ce8a,"The parents of a baby who died just moments after her breech birth have described the ""utter panic"" in the delivery room during labour. 
 
		 
Bonnie Strachan died at Ipswich Hospital on January 24 after being deprived of oxygen when she was delivered in an ""extremely poor condition"" in the breech position - meaning she was born feet rather than head first. 
  Ipswich Hospital, where Bonnie Strachan died soon after her breech birth   
Her parents, Emma and James Strachan, from Framlingham, Suffolk, who have a two-year-old son called Percy, had decided against a caesarean section as is common practice for breech babies in the UK. 

			 
Giving evidence at an inquest in Ipswich, Mrs Strachan, 29, raised concerns about the advice they were given during pregnancy and a series of mistakes in labour. 



 
She also said the delivery had not been taken seriously enough, with one midwife joking that the hospital could ""sell tickets"" for the unusual vaginal breech birth procedure. 

Describing the delivery which took place on her own birthday, Mrs Strachan said: ""We feel like our world has been turned upside down.  Our baby girl was taken from us and Percy's little sister from him. 

""The thought of a future pregnancy, labour and birth currently petrifies us."" 

She said the registrar responsible for the delivery had only delivered two breech babies previously and the latter moments of the delivery had been ""panicked"" and a ""mad fumble"". 

			 
After emerging feet first, the family felt Bonnie was ""left hanging"" for several minutes before Ms Kelly decided to release her arms and head. 

When she was eventually delivered she was rushed to a resuscitation table but the oxygen ran out, Mrs Strachan said. 

She added that staff seemed under-prepared for the delivery, for example not having the right sized forceps available. 

The couple had also been told their baby was of average size but after birth it emerged she was larger than average which is an additional risk factor. 

			 
Earlier in the delivery, Mrs Strachan said the atmosphere had been ""too relaxed"", leading her to think the situation was not being treated with sufficient seriousness. 

She added: ""It was a jovial atmosphere. The midwife commented that everybody wanted to watch a vaginal breech delivery, saying 'We could sell tickets'. 

""In many ways it seemed too relaxed.  Looking back, at times I felt left alone while everybody around me was relaxed and jovial."" 

The inquest heard that Bonnie was born ""pale and floppy"" and could not be resuscitated despite doctors trying for 29 minutes. 

Paediatric pathologist Zoe Mead said she found evidence of asphyxia and hypoxia associated with low oxygen levels. 

			 
She said Bonnie was larger than average and this, along with the breech position, were risk factors which could have contributed. 

""Although there are risk factors it is difficult to know in this case what specifically caused the hypoxia which I thought was there,"" Dr Mead added. 

The couple had considered a procedure to turn the baby during pregnancy. 

However, after taking advice from a consultant, they decided against this because of the risks involved and the low chances of success. 

They were also concerned about the complications associated with a caesarean, particularly as Mrs Strachan had suffered previous health problems including diabetes. 

Mrs Strachan said they were informed that, because of the established practice of delivering breech babies by caesarean, many medics were not accustomed to performing vaginal breech births but they were reassured about the risks. 

""We were told that if a vaginal breech birth wasn't progressing as expected a caesarean would be performed,"" Mrs Strachan said. 

""We thought that this was a good option.  We do not feel we had properly been made aware of the risks of a vaginal breech delivery."" 

A consultant, Andrew Leather, who knew the family and was an expert in breech deliveries had offered to attend but the offer was turned down, Mrs Strachan said. 

Giving evidence, midwife Suzanne Kelly said she was aware of hospital guidelines which say a consultant should be present at vaginal breech deliveries. 

The consultant was called to attend three times but did not arrive, she added. 

The family has instructed medical negligence law firm Irwin Mitchell to represent them. 

Coroner Peter Dean is expected to conclude the inquest on Wednesday.

c41a28ca-8aaf-43c9-98a3-f4e52eb518b9,"Godolphin's jockey James McDonald remembers his first Golden Rose ride. It ended in defeat and suspension on Foxwedge four years ago but a lot has changed for the kid from New Zealand since then. 

Godolphin jockey James McDonald remembers his first Golden Rose ride. It ended in defeat and suspension on Foxwedge four years ago – but a lot has changed since then for the kid from New Zealand.

""It was my big introduction into racing in Australia,"" McDonald said. ""It was my first big ride for John [O'Shea]. It was an honour to ride for him at that stage and to be on a colt with that ability. But things never went to plan.""

A year later he would again ride for O'Shea, this time finishing third on Ashokan – his best result in the spring classic – behind two Darley charges, Epaulette and Albrecht. He was still a boy learning his craft.

McDonald arrives at Rosehill on Saturday on the favourite Exosphere for racing's biggest operation. The quietly spoken, almost shy hoop is at the top of his game. He has the job many would covet and the record they should envy.

He has won seven $1 million races in the past two seasons and is the complete group 1 rider. A couple of years riding full time in Australia sees him no longer try too hard on the big stage, he just lets his talent shine.

""As you get older you get a lot more experience under your belt. When you are full of confidence things happen for you in the right way,"" McDonald said summing up the difference between now and then.

""The move to Australia has taken my riding to a whole new level, even a level and a half if I can say that.""

McDonald rolls off his record with some pride. It is not boastful and shows the improvement from riding against the Bowmans, Rawillers, Cassidys and Shinns.

""I have been here for a couple of years and run second in a Melbourne Cup [Fiorente] and a Caulfield Cup [Rising Romance] and won a Golden Slipper [Mossfun] and a Queen Elizabeth Stakes [It's A Dundeel]. I have had a dream run,"" he said.

""Experience and confidence are two of the biggest elements you need. Obviously the horse is the biggest part of it and I have been lucky to have them as well.

""It is a factor that every young jockey faces when you start riding [in big races]. It is hard to get your head around it when you start riding in million-dollar races. I go out there and ride my race not the race these days.""

McDonald knows the Golden Rose means a lot more than a trophy after the race. It means a career beyond the track for the winning colt. Six out of the past seven winners stand at stud. Manawanui, the 2011 winner, the exception because he is a gelding.

""There is a whole lot more involved [in this race], particularly for His Highest Sheikh Mohammed, and his breeding operation. I'm a part of that and want to get the job done for the whole team,"" McDonald said.

Exosphere showed a devastating turn of foot to win the Run To The Rose and when it became clear Golden Slipper winner Vancouver wasn't going to be there on Saturday, he became favourite.

A winner of three of his five starts, Exosphere's two defeats have been inglorious lasts and there is unfinished business after the Golden Slipper when he pulled up with heart arrhythmia.

""He is very talented. The Slipper never suited him. He got back in the field and pulled up with a lot of problems post race as we know. To me that is a completely forget run. It never happened,"" McDonald said.

He has also won on Godolphin's other two runners in the Golden Rose, Shards in the Up And Coming Stakes last start and Holler on debut, and has respect for them.

""Shards is a very talented horse that is very laid back, and push button. I think he will be the one over a mile. He gives me that sort of feel,"" McDonald said. ""Holler is going superb. We have always had a massive wrap on him ever since he stepped out at the races.

""But my horse's record says he is better than the other two, he has won two group 2 races and you would have to put him on top."" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",James McDonald ready to come up roses on Exosphere,News,Newcastle Herald,2015-09-10T02:47:16Z
827f936e-65ab-49e6-a938-c6cb49f6f908,"1. Lachie Blair was going about his day when he noticed an extremist preacher shouting his anti-gay sermon on the street. He started recording the incident, but ended up catching an amazing little Scottish hero step in and save the day.    2. The audio is hard to hear in the video, but Lachie told BuzzFeed, “He did say that he believed the ‘gay agenda’ would ruin Britain, and he described the LGBT+ community as ‘sinners,’ who he said would burn in hell.”

Yikes. 
   3. A little bit late, the faint sound of bagpipes is heard, and this little boy came in hot to drown out everything the preacher was saying.  
Lachie said, “I uploaded the video not only because it is an excellent response to hate speech in a quintessentially Scottish fashion, but also to highlight the point that discrimination against LGBT+ people is not tolerated by the vast majority of people in the West and that everyday citizens such as the bagpiper are not willing to accept discrimination.” 
   4. The crowd immediately started cheering for the piper, and the man gradually stopped and picked up his things.          
View this image › 
  
Lachie told BuzzFeed, “I hope people take the actions of the piper as inspiration to stand up against discrimination when you see it and to challenge those who would condemn others on the basis of their sexuality, race, or religion.”

18dc2561-fd46-4628-801a-9f36a8cc2c40,"U.S. stocks extended their selloff into a third straight session Thursday, dragged down by declines among big industrial firms and auto makers.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 195 points, or 1.2%, to 16085 in early afternoon trade.

Shares of Caterpillar Inc. posted the biggest decline in the Dow after the maker of heavy equipment cut its revenue outlook and announced up to 10,000 job cuts as part of a cost-cutting plan. Shares fell 6.3%, knocking 28 points off the index.

The S&P 500 lost 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2%.

Investors sought shelter in assets perceived as safe, including U.S. government debt. Rising prices sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to its lowest level in nearly a month, recently falling to 2.098%.

""When a bellwether like Caterpillar says something like that, it's going to take its toll on the sector for sure,"" said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird. ""There's a flight to things that aren't stocks.""

Industrial companies in the S&P 500 fell 1.4%.

The declines in the U.S. followed steep falls in Europe, where the scandal enveloping Volkswagen AG hit autos shares again. The Stoxx Europe 600 shed 2.1%. Germany's DAX declined 1.9% and France's CAC 40 fell 1.9%.

BMW AG shares fell 5.2% in Frankfurt after a magazine reported that emissions of a model of the German car maker were higher than allowed under standardized testing conditions. BMW said it hasn't manipulated test results.

Shares of U.S. auto makers also lost ground. General Motors Co. fell 1.6%, while Ford Motor Co. declined 1.3%.

U.S. stocks have yet to bounce back meaningfully from a steep selloff that began in late August. Last week's announcement that the Federal Reserve would continue to keep interest rates near zero has failed to give shares a lift. The Dow is up 2.7% from its Aug. 25 low, but remains down 12% from its most recent record of 18312 reached in May.

The Federal Reserve's decision last week to keep short-term interest rates near zero has failed to give stocks much of a lift. Many investors say the central bank's decision to stand pat instead affirmed worries that global growth was slowing.

Investors remained cautious ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen later in the day at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, which could offer clues on the timing of a rise in rates.

In economic news, initial jobless claims rose by 3,000 to 267,000 in the week ended Sept. 19, the Labor Department said Thursday, a level consistent with an improving labor market. Economists had expected 275,000 new claims.

Orders for big-ticket items fell in August, a sign that the strong dollar and economic weakness overseas may be crimping demand for American goods. New orders for durable goods fell 2% in August from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Economists had expected orders to fall 2.5%.

""Investors' confidence is fragile. Markets are uncertain post the Fed decision,"" said James Barty, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

In commodities, crude oil in New York rebounded from early losses, rising 0.7% to $44.76 a barrel. Gold futures gained 1.8% to $1,152.10 a troy ounce.

Shares in Japan fell sharply as trading resumed after a three-day holiday. The Nikkei Stock Average closed down 2.8% , catching up with declines in global markets over recent sessions. China's Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.9% higher.

The euro rose 0.5% against the dollar to trade around $1.1240, after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Wednesday the central bank is ready to expand its quantitative easing program, but that there is no urgency to do so.

The future results of NEP and its business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause NEP's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, or may require it to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: NEP has a limited operating history and its projects may not perform as expected; NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders is affected by wind and solar conditions at its projects; operation and maintenance of energy projects involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages or reduced output; the wind turbines at some of NEP's projects and at some of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC's (NEER) right of first offer projects (ROFO Projects) are not generating the amount of energy estimated by their manufacturers' original power curves, and the manufacturers may not be able to restore energy capacity at the affected turbines; NEP depends on certain of the projects in its portfolio for a substantial portion of its anticipated cash flows; terrorist or similar attacks could impact NEP's projects or surrounding areas and adversely affect its business; NEP's energy production may be substantially below its expectations if a natural disaster or meteorological conditions damage its turbines, solar panels, other equipment or facilities; NEP is not able to insure against all potential risks and it may become subject to higher insurance premiums; warranties provided by the suppliers of equipment for NEP's projects may be limited by the ability of a supplier to satisfy its warranty obligations or if the term of the warranty has expired or liability limits, which could reduce or void the warranty protections, or the warranties may be insufficient to compensate NEP's losses; supplier concentration at certain of NEP's projects may expose it to significant credit or performance risks; NEP relies on interconnection and transmission facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its projects and, if these facilities become unavailable, NEP's projects may not be able to operate or deliver energy; NEP's business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations; NEP's projects may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy regulations; NEP's partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of its common units, and under certain circumstances this could be reduced to 10%; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or leaseholders that have rights that are superior to NEP's rights or the BLM suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact its operations, including future proceedings related to projects it subsequently acquires; the Summerhaven, Conestogo and Bluewater projects are subject to Canadian domestic content requirements under their Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) contracts; NEP's cross-border operations require NEP to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and non-U.S. jurisdictions; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership or acquisition of projects that remain under construction, which could result in its inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of energy sale counterparties and NEP is exposed to the risk that they are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated agreements, such as its power purchase agreements (PPAs), Renewable Energy Standard Offer Program (RESOP) Contracts and FIT Contracts, at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; if the energy production by or availability of NEP's U.S. projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under NEP's U.S. project entities' PPAs; NEP's growth strategy depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional projects consistent with its business strategy at favorable prices; NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP's (NEP OpCo) partnership agreement requires that it distribute its available cash, which could limit its ability to grow and make acquisitions; lower prices for other fuel sources reduce the demand for wind and solar energy; government regulations providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could change at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP's growth strategy; NEP's growth strategy depends on the acquisition of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and third parties, which face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, the environment, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements; NEP's ability to effectively consummate future acquisitions depends on its ability to arrange the required or desired financing for acquisitions; acquisitions of existing clean energy projects involve numerous risks; renewable energy procurement is subject to U.S. state and Canadian provincial regulations, with relatively irregular, infrequent and often competitive procurement windows; while NEP currently owns only wind and solar projects, NEP may acquire other sources of clean energy, including natural gas and nuclear projects, and may expand to include other types of assets including transmission projects, and any future acquisition of non-renewable energy projects, including transmission projects, may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to NEP's more-established competitors. A failure to successfully integrate such acquisitions with NEP's then-existing projects as a result of unforeseen operational difficulties or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to grow its business and make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP faces substantial competition primarily from regulated utilities, developers, independent power producers (IPPs), pension funds and private equity funds for opportunities in North America

Bad news: According to 9to5Mac , Apple will offer a 16GB iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus when the devices are announced next week. I say bad news because many competitors have moved on to 32GB as the standard, and given the increasing size of photos, videos and apps, 16GB just doesn’t cut it for most people. And yet, Apple will inexplicably stick by the meager storage option . 
 
Pricing for the models will stay the same as well; the iPhone 6s will come in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB options, retailing for $199, $299 and $399 on contract; the iPhone 6 Plus, meanwhile, will come in the same storage options, and retail for $299, $399 and $499 with a two-year contract agreement. Prices for the devices unlocked will also remain the same. 
 
9to5Mac goes on to confirm Apple’s new handsets will sport the stronger 7000 series aluminum , which was all but confirmed in a recent video testing the strength of a supposed iPhone 6s shell. That’s good news for folks who were affected by “bendgate” last year, and means Apple’s devices should be more durable than ever. (That doesn’t mean you should go around trying to bend it.) 
 
Additionally, 9to5Mac says no iPhone 6c will be announced next week, though the 4-inch device is still expected sometime this year . Previous rumors have claimed the plastic handset could see a release toward the end of 2015, possibly in time for the busy holiday season. 
 
Apple’s big iPhone upgrade is expected to feature Force Touch, improved internals, a 12-megapixel camera, and maybe even animated wallpapers. Otherwise, the same aluminum design will remain, much like the iPhone 4/iPhone 4s and iPhone 5/iPhone 5s upgrade in years past. 
 
Apple’s event is scheduled for Wednesday, Sept. 9.

1dff7428-fe60-46b5-a208-08ac35cfeec9,"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has no interest in reopening a war of words with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge. 

The rival coaches squared up in the dugout last season during the Blues' 2-0 win and then f ollowing Arsenal's victory in the 2015 FA Community Shield at Wembley there was no handshake between the pair. 

However, despite the intense media focus on the pair's simmering rivalry, which has included Mourinho once branding the long-serving Arsenal manager a ""specialist in failure"" , Wenger would rather his side's performance on the pitch make the headlines. 

He said: ""No special relationship (between any manager) is my worry, all I worry about is our performance tomorrow.

""I respect everybody in the job and focus on what I love and that is football. All the rest honestly does not concern me much.

""Realistically people come to watch football and all the rest is a little bit secondary. What is important is the quality of what we will see tomorrow morning at 12.45 and you want people to focus on that."" 

Asked if he would shake Mourinho's hand and if he regretted their touchline bust-up, Wenger replied: ""I don't want to talk about that. I have nothing more to say about this situation.""

Wenger was asked if he felt Chelsea were in decline. He replied: "" I don't know, I leave that to the specialists. I take care of my team and my own problems.""

PETER Michael Bradshaw was to stand trial in July over the death of Janelle Kathleen Knox, but pleaded guilty at the last minute. 
The West Australian Supreme Court heard that Ms Knox and Bradshaw, both 34 at the time of the April 2013 attack, were with other Kelmscott hostel residents on the banks of the Canning River and all of them were ""very drunk"". The pair had been friends and Bradshaw had listened to Ms Knox's loud complaints about her life. She was homeless after being assaulted by her then-boyfriend and had been asked to leave the hostel for not paying her rent. Ms Knox was crying and being loud, saying she wanted to ""end it all"". ""That was getting to him,"" defence lawyer David McKenzie said during sentencing on Monday. Bradshaw started signalling his intent to the others, saying ""I can get rid of this problem"" and that he had ""fresh meat"" to use as bait while they fished for marron. Ms Knox was then strangled from behind with a rope and her body was dragged into the river. ""Initially you were there as her friend ... tragically, your attitude changed,"" Justice Lindy Jenkins said. ""Your motive was to rid yourself of a troublesome person who you say wanted to die anyway."" Bradshaw claimed he wasn't the only killer, and while Justice Jenkins said she could not be completely certain he was the sole attacker, she did not accept his version of events. Justice Jenkins said the crime was aggravated by the fact he tried to clean up the scene and stole his victim's personal belongings. Speaking with reporters outside court, Ms Knox's cousin Emma Knox said the family was satisfied with the sentence but had found it difficult listening to the evidence. ""I think it's a very appropriate sentence,"" she said. ""Nothing will ever bring her back though. Janelle ... was a diamond in the rough. She'll never be forgotten."" Ms Knox is survived by her eight-year-old son, who is living with family. ""We see a little bit of her in him.""",Man jailed for Perth strangling murder,News,Gold Coast Bulletin,2015-09-07T05:32:06Z
0841a7eb-e482-4267-bab9-58832f3b78c4,"Two schools in the greater Louisville, Kentucky, area went into lockdown on Thursday after authorities received a call of an active shooter on one of the campuses, according to WFSB, a local news station. 

The call, which informed authorities that there was a shooter at Western High School, was first received at 9:07 a.m. Authorities responded immediately, putting both Western High School and Waller-Williams Environmental School, which was shut down because of its proximity to the other school, on lockdown. 

Similarly, 10 schools in the greater San Diego area went into lockdown after they all received threats Thursday, according to NBC San Diego. All 10 schools lifted their bans after authorities searched the buildings and didn’t find anything threatening. 

The common thread between these two events is that officials and authorities acted with lockdowns before any violent attacks. That’s not surprising as school lockdowns have been a common form of school safety since the late ‘90s, according to NPR. 

In fact, lockdowns are so common that The New York times called them ""the new fire drill."" 

Despite their popularity, not all support the use of lockdowns. In the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, some criticized lockdowns because they're a passive strategy that keeps teachers and students from taking action against security threats, ABC News reported. 

""We've taught a generation of Americans to be passive and static and wait for police,"" Greg Crane, founder of ALICE, a school safety program, told ABC News. ""We don't recommend just locking a door because locked doors have been defeated before."" 

Crane also said teachers don't feel safe during lockdowns because they are often asked to shut off the lights and hide with the children. 

Despite these criticisms, most experts recommend lockdowns and other preemptive measures to limit safety threats. 

The National Association of School Psychologists published a report that said one of the best school safety practices is thinking ahead and . To do this, the NASP suggests schools create a multitiered system of supports that “encompass prevention, wellness promotion, and interventions that increase with intensity based on student need, and that promote close school–community collaboration.” This will help school officials identity potentially threatening students or school safety threats before they come to fruition, the report says. 

The report also suggests the federal government provide more state funding for school safety measures. Experts agree that schools need more funding and resources to help keep children safe while in school. 

""The vast majority have a crisis plan on paper. It's much more common that we find those plans are collecting dust on the shelf and ,"" Kenneth Trump, a school security consultant, told CNN. ""I don't believe we need to throw out the book of best practices on school safety. I think we do need to focus our resources, times and conversation back on the fundamentals."" 

Experts say it’s important for parents and teachers alike to encourage children to come forward with any information they know about potential school threats or dangerous students, CNN reported.",Are lockdowns the best school safety practice?,News,Nebraska City News Press,2015-09-21T12:51:39Z

 Magnum Entertainment Group Holdings Limited  
(Incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability) 
 (Stock Code: 2080)  INSIDE INFORMATION:  (1) CLOSURE OF ONE OF THE CLUBS AND  (2) PROFIT WARNING  
This announcement is made by Magnum Entertainment Group Holdings Limited (the ""Company"", together with its subsidiaries, the ""Group"") pursuant to the provisions under Part XIVA of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571 of the Laws of Hong Kong) and Rule 13.09(2)(a) of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the ""Listing Rules""). 
 CLOSURE OF ONE OF THE CLUBS  
Reference is made to the Company's announcement dated 5 January 2015 in relation to the closure and renovation of Beijing Club, one of the clubs of the Group which operates in leased premises with the current term of tenancy expiring by end of February 2016. Following the re-opening of the renovated Beijing Club in June 2015, the Group's management has been considering the business performance and prospects of Beijing Club. In light of the loss-making performance of Beijing Club notwithstanding management's effort to turn around the business, to focus available resources on the other clubs of the Group and to save future rental expenses, the board (the ""Board"") of directors (the ""Directors"") of the Company announces that the Group will not seek to renew the tenancy for the premises of Beijing Club upon its expiry and has closed down Beijing Club with effect from 15 
September 2015 for carrying out necessary reinstatement works at the premises, which may take up to six months, so as to deliver the reinstated and vacated premises to the landlord upon expiry of the tenancy by end of February 2016. 
Based on the estimated costs of the reinstatement works and the applicable percentage ratios, the reinstatement works will not constitute notifiable transaction of the Company under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules. The costs of the reinstatement works will be funded by the internal resources of the Group. 
In light that the Company has recently announced the planned closure of Dizzi, another club of the Group, by the end of October 2015 by way of the Company's announcement dated 14 August 2015, the Board would like to emphasize that the closure of the two clubs is to streamline and optimize the clubbing business of the Group with a view to enhancing the overall business performance of the Group. The Board considers that the planned closure of Beijing Club and Dizzi would not have material adverse effect on the overall business operations of the Group given that Magnum and Zentral, the two other clubs of the Group, have been and are expected to continue to be the main pillars of the Group's clubbing business. The Group will continue its drive to fortify its pioneer position in the clubbing and entertainment industry in Hong Kong and will remain vigilant in pursuing growth opportunities. 
 PROFIT WARNING  
Based on a preliminary assessment by the Company's management on the unaudited consolidated management accounts of the Company for the four months ended 31 July 2015 and currently available information, the Board wishes to inform the shareholders and potential investors of the Company that the Group is expected to record a net loss for the six months ending 30 September 2015 as compared with a net profit of approximately HK$11.25 million for the six months ended 30 September 2014, notwithstanding that the Group's turnover is expected to be only slightly below that for the corresponding period in 2014. Such deterioration was mainly attributable to (i) the weakening sentiment in the consumer market which restrained growth in patronage for the clubbing operations of the Group, (ii) the temporary closure of Beijing Club from January to June 2015 for renovation purpose without any rent-free period and the renovation expenses incurred; and (iii) full effect of the operational and rental expenses of Zentral, which was opened in December 2014, for the six months ending 30 September 2015. 
The Board wishes to state that this announcement is made on a preliminary assessment on the unaudited consolidated management accounts of the Company for the four months ended 31 July 2015 and currently available information, which have not been audited or reviewed by the Company's auditor and may be subject to adjustments. Details of the financial information and performance of the Group for the six months ending 30 September 2015 will be disclosed in the interim results announcement of the Company which is expected to be published in November 2015. 
 Shareholders and potential investors of the Company are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the securities of the Company.

c4a90bae-3b9d-4266-bf61-120fcbb563bb,"BILLINGS, Mont. — A U.S. Senate committee is holding a field hearing on pipeline safety Friday following a recent surge in accidents, including oil spills that fouled a Montana river and a scenic stretch of Southern California coastline.

The hearing at Montana State University, Billings comes after a boom in U.S. energy production reversed years of declines in the number of pipeline mishaps.

Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines said he requested the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee examine challenges faced by inspectors from the U.S. Department of Transportation.

More than 30,000 gallons of oil spilled into the Yellowstone River in January from a Bridger Pipeline LLC line near Glendive, shutting down the eastern Montana city's water supply.

In May, a corroded pipeline owned by Plains All American released at least 101,000 gallons of crude near Santa Barbara, California.

Both accidents remain under investigation, according to federal officials.

In 2014, there were 445 pipeline accidents spilling a combined 1.9 million gallons of hazardous liquids, which include crude oil. That's roughly 30 percent more accidents than the annual rate prior to 2008, when domestic oil production started to ramp up due largely to expanded production of shale oil in the Northern Plains and Texas.

Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester and Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer also are scheduled to attend Friday's hearing. Fischer said she's particularly interested in safety concerns in rural areas.

There are roughly 2.6 million miles of pipeline nationwide, according to the Transportation Department's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

As new lines have been added and accidents have drawn attention to gaps in federal oversight, the pipeline agency has added more than 100 new positions, most of them responsible for inspections and enforcement.",US senate committee probes pipeline safety after oil spills,News,Kentucky.com,2015-09-18T09:02:00Z

Croatia's prime minister has urged Serbia to ""send refugees in other directions too,"" as police reported that 34,900 migrants have entered the country in less than a week. 
 
Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said Tuesday that Belgrade should send some of the refugees to Hungary or Romania. He also says the refugee problem should be solved ""at its source,"" in Greece or Turkey, which most Syrian or Iraqi refugees pass through to get to Europe. 
 
Overwhelmed by the influx, Croatia has been transporting migrants to its borders with Slovenia or Hungary — more than 6,000 migrants left that way Monday and Tuesday. 
 
The crisis has strained diplomatic relations in the region, which has become a transit route for migrants bound for Western Europe.

The sudden onset of fall weather in Greece, with thunderstorms and torrential rain over the past two days, has sent hundreds of migrants who had been camping out in a downtown Athens square scrambling for shelter. 
 
About 100 men, women and children found dry spaces in the Victoria Square metro station Tuesday, while another roughly 400 people, mostly Afghans, remained in the square, huddling in tents or using rubbish bin liners and plastic bags to keep off the worst of the rain. Others took shelter in public telephone booths and under building awnings. 
 
Authorities had bussed many of those sleeping in the square to a sports stadium in a southern Athens suburb during a severe thunderstorm Monday evening, where they can stay for a few days while the bad weather lasts. But many are returning to the square during the day.

Hungary's foreign minister says political relations with fellow European Union neighbor Croatia are at a ""freezing point"" and may improve only after parliamentary elections there expected by the end of the year. 
 
Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto says Tuesday it was easier for Croatia to quickly transport migrants to the border with Hungary instead of caring for them themselves. He said bilateral affairs could improve ""if there are elections in Croatia and the new government thinks it wants to improve this relationship."" 
 
Szijjarto says while Hungary had done everything possible to register 230,000 migrants this year, it had failed in some cases because of the aggressive behavior of some migrants and EU rules making it hard to enforce registration.

Anders Anundsen says such controls give ""a better overview and control of who is in the country."" Anundsen said the move was ""not about reintroducing systematic"" border controls nor ""to cut the right to seek asylum in Norway for displaced people."" 
 
He added it was up to the national police to find out how to increase surveillance.

Aleksandar Vucic said Tuesday that Croatia's closure of the main border crossing for cargo trucks early Monday is ""a scandal of international proportions."" Vucic gave the European Commission a 2 p.m. (1300 GMT, 9 a.m. EDT) deadline to reopen the traffic, before an emergency government session he is to chair. 
 
Landlocked Serbia says it is losing millions of dollars a day because of the blockade. Croatia has hinted it may close the last remaining border crossing with Serbia for all traffic, including people, if Serbia retaliates. 
 
Croatia, which has last week closed all but one border crossing with Serbia, wants to pressure Serbia to stop sending the migrants toward Croatian borders and rather channel them further north to Hungary.

In the Turkish border city of Edirne, migrants remain at a wrestling arena about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the Greek border. 
 
Hundreds of migrants have made the trek to Edirne in the hope of being allowed to cross into neighboring Greece or Bulgaria and avoid the often-risky journey across the Aegean Sea. Many arrived last week but have been blocked from approaching the border by law enforcement. Hundreds more were stranded in Istanbul after bus companies refused to issue them tickets. 
 
Although many have pledged to remain until the borders are opened, many have given up on a crossing and have been bused back to other cities in Turkey.

Troubles started at the camp, when more migrants came to the gates than authorities could handle. Police in the Croatian village of Opatovac pushed people back from the front gate, asked them to sit down and to wait their turn. 
 
Croatia set up a migrant reception operation to try to bring order to the unrelenting chaos that has gripped the country since Sept. 15, when Hungary closed its border with Serbia. That decision diverted waves of people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia to Croatia.

Jarman said: “Icon’s experience in delivering some of the world’s most high profile events, combined with local production, clearly brings something new and unique to the market here.” Jarman continued: “We have already shown we can deliver brand and live experiences coast to coast; now I’m really excited to capitalize on this early success.” 
 
Icon executive chairman, John Francis commented: “North America was a logical step in Icon’s expansion plans; it’s such a key global market and a particularly progressive one. This initial success underlines our belief that there’s a gap in the market, where we can work with clients in bringing brands to life. It lays the foundation for a long-term, profitable business in North America.”

GAGA STYLIST BRANDON MAXWELL STEPS INTO THE SPOTLIGHT

Brandon Maxwell knows how to make a woman feel beautiful.

The stylist to superstar Lady Gaga debuted his own line of women's ready-to-wear Monday night, with his celebrity client there before, during and after the show. Wearing (what else) a Brandon Maxwell designed black pants suit with a low V-neck, Lady G said she was ""beyond proud"" of her stylist.

And Maxwell returned the love.

""It is such a special relationship, I think,"" Maxwell said. ""She really took a chance on me, in a lot of ways, not only as a creative collaborator, but also as a best friend. She has been there for me in times like this, but she has also been there for me at 3 o'clock in the morning when I am crying and couldn't get through the day, so it was obviously a no-brainer that she was here. And she was here all week, she's been in the hotel with my family, you know, helping and wrangling and dealing.""

His collection included impeccably tailored suits, jumpsuits and gowns, nearly all of them in black or white - a classic look Maxwell said was inspired by his mother. The collection featured deep B-necks, capes, layered waistbands and the show-stopper; a puffy, organza cage cape over a simple strapless black gown.

""I know everyone thinks their mom is the most beautiful, but I really felt like my mom was the most beautiful growing up,"" he said. ""And she always was very timeless and classic and polite and manners, and you know, she worked during the day and then she volunteered for hospice at night and she always was sort of doing good for the world and she always had taste and didn't show too much and wasn't too over the top and she is sort of my inspiration always.""

DARKLY CHIC AND EASY AT ZAC POSEN

The evening wear king has seen the light of day.

Posen put on a show dominated by looks for daytime in dark blacks, navy and bright whites with just a pop of red and sparkle, on Monday. And his models were treated to elegant flat shoes!

He has a shorthand for this spring mix: ""maximal minimalism.""

There were structured shoulders, monastic architectural bodices and rounded skirts on dresses, but also roomy, flowing looks accented by open seams on deconstructed sleeves, jackets and other garments.

""It's form,"" he said in a backstage interview after the show put on under ornate chandeliers in a Grand Central Terminal hall. ""The detail in the clothing is intense and the clothing is crafted, from articulated seams to embroideries on cottons. But the overall shapes have a sense of cleanliness and form to them, and a sense of ease.""

So why did the wunderkind take on so much daywear at this juncture in his career, 13 years after his first runway show?

""We've built so much eveningwear and presented it. It's important to me as I grew up to re-look at my woman and say, for the runway, you can propose options for day,"" Posen said. ""There were still gowns, but you have to keep it exciting on the runway. It's important to surprise and to challenge yourself. I didn't want any themes. I wanted to keep it contemporary and modern and refreshing.""

Looks were roomy but retained shape through clever belting. A pair of split short pants in white were extra wide. He left backs open in silky satin and hinged the seams for an open effect on his sole red look, a strapless dress, and other outfits.

No worries, ladies looking for fresh Posens in a broader range of shades. He said he has plenty of other colors back at the showroom.

 Taylor Swift and her squad are subjects of endless media speculation . (Don't deny it: We know you're curious about the inner-workings of the girl gang, too.) But whatever your opinion, one thing's for sure: All of the girls are money-making powerhouses. 
Forbes broke down all of their estimated earnings from June 2014 to 2015, and the results are jaw-droppingly impressive. Kendall Jenner, for instance, raked in $4 million — need we remind you that she's merely 19 years old? Cara Delevingne took home $9 million from being the face of 13 different brands, plus nabbing acting gigs, like this summer's Paper Towns . Karlie Kloss earned $5 million while Gigi Hadid made $2.5 million from campaigns for Guess and Seafolly. And as the leader of the pack, Swift earned a whopping $80 million. 

Factoring in Martha Hunt and Lily Aldridge's salaries as well, after Forbes ' calculations, the total for all seven ladies comes to an estimated $104.5 million. Not bad.

10450f58-ba93-44cf-877b-f7696b38184b,"RIMOUSKI, QUEBEC--(Marketwired - Sept. 17, 2015) - Puma Exploration (TSX VENTURE:PUM) has secured its strategic land holding at the 100% owned Little Stull Lake Gold Project in Manitoba by renewing the 20 claims (2,900 ha) that cover its gold zones for an additional 5 years, until 2025. Following the current 10 year secured, Puma has exploration work credits sufficient to keep the claims in good standing for an additional 55 years, until 2080. 
 
The most recent corporate activity in the area is the Yamana Gold (YRI-TSX) takeover of Mega Precious Metals (MGP-TSXV) which holds the Monument Bay Gold Deposit (see MGP news release 2015-06-22) located 15km southwest of the Little Stull Lake Gold Deposit. Puma holds a 100% interest in 42 continuous kilometers of strike length (37,925 hectares) along a gold-bearing greenstone belt. The land holding is composed of the adjoining Little Stull Lake claims (2,900ha) and the Kistigan (14,715 ha) and Edmund Lake (20,310 ha) Mineral Exploration Licenses (MEL). 
 
The Little Stull Lake gold zones lies in a similar geological environment to that of the nearby Monument Bay deposit being developed by Mega Precious Metals (now Yamana Gold). Monument Bay contains 3.1 million ounces of gold (MGP news release 2014-11-21). Puma drilling carried out on its Little Stull Lake property resulted in the discovery of high-grade gold mineralization in an Archean greenstone belt The gold mineralization is mainly confined to quartz veins in brecciated basalt 25 to 50 metres thick. This unit has so far been traced on surface at Little Stull Lake Property for more than 5 km and coincides with a major regional fault striking more than 60 km in length. 
 
On the basis of drilling during the 1980's and early 1990's (202 holes for 30 515 metres), Westmin estimated potential resources of 750,000 tonnes @ 10.3 g/t Au: a total of slightly more than 250,000 ounces of gold over a small section of the greenstone belt (1.5km). The historical resource estimates were prepared prior to the implementation of NI43-101 and use terminology not compliant with current reporting standards. Puma has not made any attempt to re-classify the estimates according to current standards of disclosure and is not treating the estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Historical estimates should not be relied upon. Investors are cautioned that ""potential resources"" are considered conceptual in nature and there is no guarantee that historic ""potential resources"" will be able to be converted into NI43-101 compliant resource categories or demonstrate economic viability. 
 
Puma completed ten (10) drill holes totalling 1,500 metres in the Little Stull Lake gold property's 11W Zone in 2007. This zone carries the highest gold grades intersected in drilling of the basalt during previous work, with 330 g/t Au, 202 g/t Au, and 125 g/t Au over one metre of core which are included in longer intercepts of 7.4 g/t Au over 47.0m and 4.5 g/t Au over 45.2m. All of Puma's holes intersected the mineralized basalt, which contains an average of three core intersections one metre in length with gold values ranging from 1 to 46 g/t Au. Moreover, the drilling intersected some high-grade layers one metre long containing 46.0 g/t Au, 15.6 g/t Au, 8.4 g/t Au, and 7.2 g/t Au (PUM news release 2008-09-01). 
 
Puma is currently finalizing the 3D modelization of the latest successful drilling program at Turgeon VMS. The next drilling program will target higher-grade areas within the Dragon Zone and will begin shortly following the new model develop with the latest data. 
 
Puma would also like to announce its new Mobile App is now available on Android and Apple smartphone's. You can download the App by searching for Puma Exploration.

LaGRANGE — Hundreds of people from across the state gathered in downtown LaGrange on Saturday for the annual Paint The Town Pink breast cancer awareness event and walk. 

The morning included the HOPE — Helping Other People Endure — for a Day Walk, a 10-mile fundraising journey of hope to strive for a day without cancer. The walk started six years ago when an Atlanta organization that distributes money for breast cancer care denied funding to West Georgia Health and Breast Friends for Life for their outreach programs. 

Breast Friends for Life co-founder Pam Herndon of LaGrange, whose sister, Jeanie Carlson, died of breast cancer, suggested that Breast Friends for Life start a local walk—one that would keep the money raised in Troup and surrounding counties for breast cancer patients and their families. 

The inaugural walk netted $66,000, way beyond expectations. In its five years, walkers have raised over half a million dollars for the West Center Georgia Cancer Coalition’s and District 4 Health Services’ breast health and cancer care services; breast health screenings and mammogram vouchers for qualified women and men; and scholarships for family members of those who have had breast cancer. 

Proceeds also have helped men and women with breast cancer who have needed help financially with utility bills, rent and prescription purchases. The group has even given funds to one mother with breast cancer so she would have the means to throw her 10-year-old son a birthday party. 

Five years ago this month, the Rev. Carol Cook’s words echoed through a microphone on Lafayette Square as she opened the annual Paint the Town Pink event with prayer. 

It was the fifth year of the annual awareness and fundraising event, when hundreds of community members come together the last weekend in September to raise money for local breast cancer patients, to provide free clinical breast exams and mammogram vouchers to qualified women, and to celebrate survivorship and hope. 

On that day, Cook had no way of knowing that three years later, she would be fighting breast cancer herself. 

“I received my diagnosis in January 2013,” she said. “It really threw me for a loop. I had never really been sick before.” 

She got the news from her doctor on a Monday, and by Tuesday, she and her husband heard a knock on the door. It was Wanda Lowe, cancer care navigator at West Georgia Health and also a member of Breast Friends for Life, a local breast cancer support group. 

“Wanda came with hugs and comfort and two books, one for me and one for my husband,” Cook said. “She gave me a breast cancer treatment guide along with a companion guide for my husband. I still refer to that book.” 

Lowe and Cook both are now members of Breast Friends for Life, one of the main sponsors of Paint the Town Pink. The other main sponsors are West Georgia Health, HOPE for a Day, District 4 Public Health and the West Central Georgia Cancer Coalition. 

Sherry Callaway, also a co-founder of Breast Friends for Life, said the BFFL support group and the HOPE for a Day walk have helped her channel her personal victory against breast cancer 19 years ago into a way to help other men and women with breast cancer cope with the disease. 

“Our acronym for HOPE stands for Helping Other People Endure,” Callaway said. “I believe that God’s plan for me was to endure and in so doing, help others.” 

Mary Ann Hodnett, a breast cancer survivor who is now a secretary in West Georgia Health’s Oncology Services Department, said the women in BFFL were a godsend. 

“I met Wanda (Lowe) the day before my surgery in 2010, and she brought me a basket filled with all kinds of things to help lift my spirits,” Hodnett said. “I met the Breast Friends group soon after that. 

“They’ve become my closest friends. We don’t have to explain things to each other. It’s a safe place where everyone can relate to each other even though our treatments may have been different. My husband and I joke that since I’m not from here, I had to get cancer to get friends.” 

BFFL member Pam Barnes said she chose humor to cope with her breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, and she appreciates the humor and camaraderie among the support group members as well. 

“I tell people that radiation was one of the best times of the worst part of my life,’” she said. “Dru Morman (a WGH radiation therapist since 1981) actually made radiation a pleasant experience, if you can believe that.” 

Other group members said they enjoy the humor and friendship that Barnes brings to the group. After her last radiation treatment, Barnes started telling people that she “graduated from Camp Nukemboobie.” 

During the early years of Paint the Town Pink, Barnes created the lyrics of “Get Your Mammogram,” sung to the tune of Tammy Wynette’s “Stand By Your Man,” and performed it on Lafayette Square. It was in speaking about her story that she came up with the slogan: “Get Your Mammies Grammed.” 

Mary Ann Hodnett, a breast cancer survivor who is now a secretary in West Georgia Health’s Oncology Services Department, said the women in BFFL were a godsend. 

“I met Wanda (Lowe) the day before my surgery in 2010, and she brought me a basket filled with all kinds of things to help lift my spirits,” Hodnett said. “I met the Breast Friends group soon after that.

Breast cancer survivor Charlotte Marshall likened her diagnosis to being in a “club.” 

“It’s like joining a sorority, a very selective one, that you didn’t initially want to be a part of,” she said. “But when I found this group of women, I felt an immediate connection, a bond where I don’t have to say anything if I don’t feel like it, and I still feel supported. 

“I really found some kindred spirits being with other survivors.”

In a statement issued by the film's banners on September 2, the producers said: ""Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment Pvt Ltd and UTV Software Communications Ltd clarify that the non-governmental organisation which is depicted under the name 'Medicine International' in the film Phantom is purely fictitious and bears no resemblance to, and is not related to, any actual organisation anywhere in the world."" 

The statement comes after an aid charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), decided to take legal action against the film's producers, claiming that misrepresentation of the medical group can ""harm its work in places where its access depends on a reputation for neutrality"" and puts the lives of their aid workers deployed in conflict zones at risk. 

However, the producers have maintained that ""no activities, working, portrayal or attributes of the said fictitious organisation should be imputed to any real organisation anywhere in the world"". 

""It is further clarified that any press reports, reviews, materials, promotional interviews to the contrary are inaccurate and incorrect,"" the statement read further. 

The issue over Phantom , directed by Kabir Khan, escalated last week. 

Earlier, Martin Sloot, the general director of MSF India, said that the blurring of the lines between fact and fiction could affect MSF's work and that the MSF is mulling over taking legal action to correct the misrepresentation.

63b082ce-499e-4e8d-af94-f2cfc1aff6d3,"New Delhi: A Khap Panchayat in Uttar Pradesh has denied allegations that it ordered two young sisters to be raped because their brother eloped with a higher caste woman. The council's purported ruling led to an international outcry and hundreds of thousands of people have demanded their safety. 

Now, members of the village council in the Baghpat region have told Reuters they passed no such order. Family members of the two sisters also told Reuters they are unsure if the ruling was made. And local police deny any such directive was given. 

When the accusations first emerged last month, they spread like wildfire. An online petition by Amnesty International seeking justice and protection for the low-caste sisters gathered over 260,000 signatures, mostly in Britain. 

But family members said in interviews with Reuters the information that the council made such an order may have just been gossip. 

""It is all hearsay, we don't know if this actually happened,"" said Dharam Pal Singh, 55, the women's father and a retired soldier. ""We heard it from other villagers."" 

He identified one of the villagers, a man who also said he had heard it from others. 

The incendiary allegations were contained in a petition to the Supreme Court filed last month by a lawyer for the Singh family seeking protection for the sisters. It said one of Singh's sons fell in love with a married woman of a higher caste, leading to a row between the two families. 

In its most sensational claim, the court filing said Meenakshi Kumari, 23, and her 15-year-old sister fled their home after being told they would be stripped naked and paraded with their faces blackened before being raped to atone for their brother's transgression. 

Rahul Tyagi, the lawyer who brought the case to the Supreme Court, was hired by the family when the row over the affair started some months ago. 

Tyagi said he stood by the petition, which the family filed because of fears for the safety of the sisters, and denied failing to check the facts. However, he said he had never visited the village, nor spoken to any members of the council who supposedly issued the rape order. 

""We have documentary evidence for nine out of 10 things in the case,"" he said. ""The other things people will not come out with unless there is an independent investigation."" 

Kumari, the elder sister, admitted she didn't know if the council had issued a ruling but said she took the threat seriously because women are often punished in India for things they have not done. 

""It is very tough life for women,"" Kumari said in an interview at Tyagi's office in the capital. ""These things can happen."" 

She said she had heard of the threat to rape her from her father. 

Unelected village councils like the one in Baghpat do mete out rough justice in many parts of rural India, ruling on matters of marriage, property and how women should dress. In rare instances the councils have ordered rape as a punishment. 

However, it typically is difficult to confirm such rulings because village councils usually only issue verbal orders, and no record is kept of proceedings. 

This case appeared to fit a familiar narrative. 

Reuters interviewed more than 20 people involved in the incident in the village of Sankrod, in Baghpat district, an hour's drive away from the capital New Delhi, where closely packed concrete homes are surrounded by corn and cane fields. 

There were many discrepancies in the accounts offered by the families of the sisters and the married woman, members of the village council, the lawyer who drew up the Supreme Court petition, and police officials. 

But no one said they had any evidence that the council had handed down the rape punishment, as alleged in the court petition. The petition said the council was comprised of upper caste men.          

The village council is actually more than 80 percent female and headed by a woman who, like the sisters, is from the bottom of the caste hierarchy. 

""How many times do I have to tell you that there was no meeting?"" said Bala Devi, 55, who has run the council for the last five years. ""We spend our time discussing mundane things like fixing the roads or water pumps."" 

Sharad Sachan, a police superintendent, concluded after interviewing council leaders and other villagers that no such order had been issued. ""The Supreme Court asked us to investigate and we plan to tell them our findings later this month,"" Sachan said. 

The Supreme Court is not due to rule on the case until later this month. 

Amnesty said it did not investigate the case or visit the village, and instead relied on the court submission. 

Gopika Bashi, women's rights campaigner at Amnesty International India, said that despite the doubts cast over the story there were no plans to withdraw its petition. 

""We will continue to push for protection for the family,"" she said.","After global outcry, no proof Khap ordered rape of sisters",News,Sify,2015-09-04T02:01:12Z

c6846bb3-69d8-4eaf-944c-eea7fcd1a098,"Scotland have beaten USA - the score there 39-16. Here's part two of John Shires' blog. 

Cotter's immediate answer to Scotland's woeful first half was to change two thirds of his front row. And if he also gave his team the hairdryer at half time it certainly worked. Less than two minutes in, a textbook passing move put Visser over in the corner. No inaccuracies this time, apart from the conversion which was missed. And a couple of minutes later Russell's deft offload led to a try under the posts for Sean Maitland. Suddenly Scotland were 18-13 up. Surely the underdog had had its day.

Not quite. Another penalty from MacGinty reduced the gap to two points, but the suspicion that Scotland's fitness and strength in depth would take its toll was reinforced when replacement WP Nel bullocked his way over the line for the Scots' third try. 25-16. Momentum had switched enough now for Scotland to turn down penalty kicks in favour of attacking lineouts, a policy that paid dividends when another replacement, Matt Scott, danced through to claim a four-try bonus point.

The USA still had their moments - giant replacement prop, the quaintly named Olive Kilifi, dropped the ball with the line at his mercy - but by now the largely Scottish crowd were relaxed enough to indulge in the dreaded Mexican Wave.

Towards the end Duncan Weir added a fifth try meaning a final scoreline of 39-16 to the Scots. Comfortable, but more than a little flattering. What have we learned? That the USA are improving and willing, but ultimately limited, and that Scotland can't rely on their second string against even the weaker teams in this World Cup.

Leon Reinbrecht is charged with criminal negligence causing death and criminal negligence causing bodily harm. 
 
He was charged after a July 3, 2010, crash on Magna Bay that took the life of houseboat driver Ken Brown. 
 
Nearly five years later, his trial began in B.C. Supreme Court in Kamloops. 
 
Multiple witnesses testified about having seen a speedboat being driven erratically on the busy lake in the moments leading up to the night-time crash, which followed a post-Canada Day fireworks display. 
 
Defence lawyers poked holes in the Crown case by repeatedly focusing their questioning on whether the houseboat was properly lit. Police admitted in court they failed to check to determine one of the houseboat’s lighting systems was functioning. 
 
An expert witness for the defence testified the lighting system was not working at the time of the crash. 
 
He also raised multiple questions about the police investigation into the incident. At one point during the trial, a police investigator contacted the expert witnesses employer, the Canadian Coast Guard, in an apparent attempt to stop him from testifying. 
 
Toxicology reports showed Brown was impaired at the time of his death. The Crown put forward no evidence about whether Reinbrecht was intoxicated, but a witness who was on the speedboat at the time of the crash said Reinbrecht had been drinking. 
 
In his closing argument in June, defence lawyer Joe Doyle compared Brown to a driver on a highway without headlights. 
 
“This is running into an unlit vessel that’s moving, that should have had its lights on,” Doyle said. 
 
“He [Brown] shouldn’t have been out there.”

51f1323c-b2c2-4c83-a6a8-c0a2ab351b0e,"On this Labor Day 2015, there are nascent signs that workers may be gaining a little ground. These include: Companies like Walmart and T.J. Maxx increasing their minimum wage. Companies like Gap and Starbucks changing their job scheduling policies. And, companies like Google and Nestle improving their maternity leave benefits. These changes are occurring for a number of reasons including: Economics and the need for businesses to improve inefficient business practices that lead to lower employee productivity and higher turnover Pressure from traditional unions Pressure from other social and community organizing groups Citizen, public and political involvement New government rules and regulations The question arises how to increase and sustain the benefits flowing to employees. As the foregoing reasons illustrate, this can be accomplished employing various methods. From recent examples, however, it appears that one of the better ways to do so is by organizing through legal action. Consider the following evidence. On September 1, in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen granted class action status to Uber drivers ruling that they could sue as a group to support the assertion that they are employees rather than independent contractors and thus eligible for certain forms of reimbursement from Uber. This means that nearly 160,000 California drivers can take part in the suit. (See our earlier blog on Uber for more information on Uber and the case.) On August 27, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled that companies that did business with or through temporary staffing agencies or franchisees might qualify as ""joint employers"" of the workers in those businesses with whom they contract. The NLRB's ruling is a narrow one and would obtain only ""if workers provided by the subcontractors seek union representation."" Nonetheless, the current business model for those companies allows them to reduce labor costs significantly through this subcontracting. A change of this type could mean they might have to assume much broader employer responsibilities that they have been able to avoid through outsourcing. On August 26, on the day before going to trial, Boeing settled a 401(k) plan class action suit on behalf of 190,000 Boeing employees and retirees, which accused Boeing of failing to uphold its fiduciary duties in the administration of its 401(k) plan for employees. The suit maintained that Boeing allowed excessive fees to go unchecked by choosing higher cost retail mutual funds over cheaper options and by improperly making plan decisions to benefit vendors receiving other Boeing business. These legal cases are a sign of the times. Over the past quarter of a century or more, the playing field for workers has become an increasingly uneven one. Where a business' rewards used to be relatively evenly distributed among executives/management, shareholders, and employees, in too many instances today, the third leg on that stool has become a much shorter stick. (See our earlier blog on CEO compensation.) As a result, workers (no matter what label they are given) with limited bargaining and negotiating power turn to the courts for solutions or answers. Is there an alternative to the legal course of action' There just might be if the employees in the United States who are already ""owners"" in the companies for which they work got better organized. The August 22 edition of The Economist in its Schumpeter column titled, ""When Workers are Owners"", states, ""It is popular to lament the growing gap between capitalists and workers. In one respect, however, the gap is shrinking, the number of workers who own shares in the business that employs them. America leads the way: 32M Americans own stock in their companies through pensions and profit-sharing plans and share-ownership and share-option schemes."" It would seem that this employee ownership stake could be leveraged and turned into a group advantage as opposed to the opportunity of just voting one's individual ownership shares. This could be accomplished through actions such as securing seats in a company on the board of directors for employee representatives, having an employee ombudsperson in an the organization, and uniting with other employee-owners to revise the rules and regulations that govern pensions, profit sharing and stock ownership plans to ensure greater benefits flow through to the employees. The Schumpeter column correctly points out that employee stock ownership is not a panacea. It can result in employees holding too much of their pensions in company stock; lead to employees having too much stock in troubled companies and supporting incumbent bad management there; and, employees feeling entitled and not being as productive as they might be otherwise. The column also provides the counterpoints to each of those arguments. For us, the overriding counterpoint is the current state of affairs with regard to the American economy writ large and the American worker writ small. The current pension plan approach currently benefits companies much more than employees. There can be little argument about that. Compare and contrast what the American worker received under defined pension plans to those incredible shrinking 401(k) plans in place today. Enough said. The current definition of what constitutes ""joint employment"" also clearly favors companies over employees. It states that ""each company must be involved in the ""hiring, firing, discipline, supervision and direction"" of employees. In an article titled, ""Who's the Boss,"" The Economist reports that the the NRLB's general consul in its amicus curiae brief in the case ""urges the Board to adopt a new standard that takes into account the totality of the circumstances, including how the putative joint employers structured their commercial dealing with each other."" According to the article, the consul declared that this standard ""undermines the ability of workers to bargain for better wages, hours and working conditions."" It is Labor Day 2015. The last remaining bastion for the union movement - the public sector - is under attack. Private sector union membership is a paltry 7%. In general, that's bad news for workers. The good news is that workers are still finding ways to get organized and to make their voices heard. When workers voices are heard America works. That's the news this Labor Day.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A former University of Mississippi student who admitted helping place a noose on a statue of a civil rights activist is going to prison. 
 
A federal judge sentenced Graeme Phillip Harris on Thursday to six months in prison beginning Jan. 4, and 12 months' supervised release. Harris' lawyer argued he didn't deserve jail time. 
 
Harris pleaded guilty in June to a misdemeanor charge of using a threat of force to intimidate African-American students and employees. Prosecutors say he and two other former students placed a noose on the statue of James Meredith, a black man who integrated Ole Miss amid rioting in 1962. 
 
A second man, Austin Reed Edenfield, had been scheduled to plead guilty Wednesday. That hearing was postponed. The third former student has not been charged.

2d9c9e4e-bfe8-47bc-b481-cfdf4b9dd45f,"Nagpur: Even with the limited resources available in the city, Nagpurian Amit Samarth completed the Ironman 70.3 triathlon at Bintan, Indonesia, on August 23. Samarth, who came 27th in his age group over the 70.3 miles race, has now started training for the most daunting international races, the Ironman Triathlon, which runs over 140.6 miles.

The triathlon organized by the World Triathlon Corporation is a test of stamina, skill and, most of all, endurance. It involves a 1.9km swim, 90km bicycle ride and 21.1km marathon in that order, to be completed within a set time, making it one of the toughest one-day sporting events in the world. Ranking 132nd among the 800 contestants, the 35-year-old public health practitioner from Nagpur completed the feat in 5 hours 35 minutes and 44 seconds.

The hot and humid weather of the tropical island Bintan made it tough for all the racers. The race started at 6.30am from the South China Sea. Samarth said the rough seas forced too much water into his stomach, but his freestyle swimming skills helped him make his way towards the end of the first leg. He managed to finish the 1.9km swimming stretch in 46 minutes 28 seconds.

""The 90km cycling route that came next was extremely hilly. I feared that my cycle was springing a puncture, but fortunately nothing happened,"" said Samarth. To get nutrition throughout the cycling route, he was smart enough to stick some nutrition bars on the top tube of his bicycle. ""Whenever I felt a need to eat, I used to grab one without taking a single stop. It saved a lot of time. Every effort I took paid off,"" he said.

Samarth gives a lot of credit to his training in martial arts, in which he has grabbed a black belt four years ago. ""It helps me stay fit and focused,"" he said.

Despite his passion for endurance sports, Samarth admits that in the past his job was a major reason he couldn't settle down in one city and spare time to practice sports. In 2003, after his MBBS from IGMC, he went on to make a career in public health and left the city. ""My job involves a lot a travelling..""

After gaining 12 years experience in public health, Samarth is happy about his decision to leave the job and settle back in Nagpur three months back. ""As soon as I returned to Nagpur, I started giving a lot of time to training myself for the triathlon. I knew that this training could be very well carried out in the city. But everything was possible because of my wife Mukul's support,"" he says.

Samarth said that he used to swim for hours at Ambazari Lake. ""Early morning, I used to go for cycling rides over some good highways nearby,"" he adds.

This was Samarth's third visit to Indonesia as part of this event, while it was the ninth triathlon for him. With the Ironman 70.3 under his belt, Samarth now plans to promote endurance sports culture in the city though his organization ProHEALTH Foundation. As a start, he has organized a 10km marathon in the city in October.

bccb1b13-6c90-4793-9a40-494fe6c41991,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. and European equity-index futures signaled global stocks may only their second weekly gain since July amid bets China’s authorities can stabilize the country’s financial markets. The dollar was set for its first loss in three weeks amid receding bets the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week. 

Contracts on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index rose with U.S. futures, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index headed for a 2.2 percent gain since Sept. 4. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index is set for its biggest weekly increase in five months. The offshore yuan traded near a one-month high after a record jump Thursday. South Korea’s won led emerging-market currencies higher versus the dollar. U.S. equity-index futures rose. Oil held above $45 a barrel. 

Concern has eased this week that China’s financial-market turmoil will derail global growth, with regulators managing to rein in equity-market volatility and intervening to thwart speculation of further currency weakening. Economists and money- market traders are split on whether the Fed will raise interest rates at their Sept. 16-17 meeting. 

“Rather than being based on fundamentals, the market is being pulled and tugged by short-term events and technical levels,” Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc., said by phone in Tokyo. “We seem to be forming a bottom, but uncertainty has yet to be completely dispelled, including what happens with U.S. monetary policy.” 

Stocks 

MSCI’s All-Country World Index was little changed by 7:15 a.m. in London, heading for a 2 percent gain this week. Its Asia-Pacific counterpart has climbed about 2.8 percent since closing at the lowest since November 2012 on Monday. A measure of the regional index’s price swings over the last 30 days is at the highest level since the end of 2011, after China’s devaluation of the yuan last month roiled global markets. 

Hong Kong’s gauge of Chinese stocks is up 7.2 percent this week, the most since April 10. The Shanghai Composite Index has advanced 0.5 percent so far this week, the smallest absolute move across any comparable period this year, amid reassurance from Premier Li Keqiang that authorities have sufficient tools to prop up the economy should growth fall below their desired level. 

Euro Stoxx 50 contracts added 0.3 percent and Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures climbed 0.3 percent after a 0.5 percent gain in the U.S. stock gauge Thursday. The S&P 500 is up 1.6 percent so far in this holiday-shortened week, with technology shares leading gains. 

The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.2 percent, having advanced 2.7 percent this week, the first such gain since Aug. 7. The Nikkei 225 surged 7.7 percent Wednesday, the most since October 2008. 

Currencies 

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed Friday, heading for a 0.7 percent retreat since Sept. 4. The probability that the Fed will raise interest rates fell to 26 percent, according to federal funds futures contracts, a bellwether for traders for decades. 

That compares with 42 of 81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicting the central bank will increase its target when policy makers gather on Sept. 16-17, after holding it close to zero since 2008 to support the economy. 

The yuan fluctuated, trading at 6.3989 per dollar in Hong Kong, after touching its strongest level since Aug. 12. Authorities were said to have intervened to drive it 1.2 percent higher Thursday, the biggest gain in its five-year trading history. The move, which coincided with the opening of China’s domestic currency market to overseas central banks, saw the offshore rate’s discount to the onshore one shrink to 0.9 percent from 1.4 percent. 

South Korea’s won strengthened 0.8 percent to 1,184.46. The Bank of Korea left the seven-day repurchase rate at record-low 1.5 percent on Friday, as predicted by 16 of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Two had forecast a 25 basis-point cut. 

Commodities, Energy 

Metals have advanced this week amid reports that China, the world’s biggest user, will bring forward projects as it bids to shore up economic growth. The London Metal Exchange LMEX Index rose 4.1 percent through Thursday from Sept. 4, on track for its biggest surge in four months. 

Copper for three-month delivery on the LME advanced 5.6 percent this week, the most since the week ended May 1, and was little changed at $5,407.50 a metric ton after closing Thursday at the highest since July 21. The metal in Shanghai is up 5.4 percent this week, its biggest such gain since February. 

West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery fell as much as 45 cents before trading at $45.65 a barrel, heading for its first weekly drop since Aug. 21. The contract gained $1.77 to $45.92 on Thursday. Brent was little changed at $48.81 a barrel in London. 

U.S. crude inventories climbed a second week through Sept. 4 to keep supplies about 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average, according to the Energy Information Administration. A Senate vote paved the way for President Barack Obama to ease financial penalties for doing business with Iran, which may allow an increase in oil exports.

""We have given a step-motherly treatment to the mother of all languages since the word go. The time has come that we recognise Sanskrit as the soul of  Bharat,"" an editorial in the weekly magazine said. 

It, however, maintained this does not mean discarding English or any other Indian language, but accepting Sanskrit as the ""source of our vision of life"" and promoting it accordingly. 

""Hope that this discussion takes us beyond the distorted secularism practised in Bharat and paves the way for reinstating the rightful position to the mother of all languages,"" it further said. 

A major controversy had erupted when HRD Ministry under Smriti Irani decided to replace German with Sanskrit as the third language in government-run Kendriya  Vidyalayas. The Modi government has also been accused of trying to saffronise education. 

Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement after 'shloka' recitation by children during his recent trip to Ireland, the editorial took a dig at secularists for raking up a controversy over it. 

After he was welcomed with rendition of shlokas, Modi had said he was impressed by the way the children internalised the message in the Sanskrit verses. 

""The Irish children were reciting shlokas in Sanskrit and singing welcome songs. It did not seem to me that they were just tutored. They were able to express the feelings of the words,"" the Prime Minister said during his short speech. 

""I congratulate their teachers. It's a matter of happiness that we can do it in Ireland. But had it been done in India, then questions would have been raised on secularism,"" he had said. 

The Organiser editorial said, ""The secularists in Bharat did not disappoint him  (Modi) and they made a controversy over it. The jibe on foreign land might have hurt some people but their response reflects our general mindset towards Sanskrit and it is definitely rooted in the import of a foreign term, 'secularism'. We should not forget that he was talking to the Bharateeya community and not the foreign audience."" 

It said whether it is the recitation of Saraswati Vandana or Omkar or observance of Sanskrit Week in CBSE schools, these are opposed. 

The editorial said it was argued in Parliament that Sanskrit is the language of  Hindus. 

Certain sections opposed Surya Namaskar and Yoga, terming their practice as religious, and ""secular"" elements in the political class defended them. 

""We always denied the fact that Sanskrit and other Dharmic scriptures are not merely sacred books like in the tradition of Semitic religions but representatives of vocabulary of our thought process, culture and knowledge system,"" it said. 

The editorial said it is widely recognised world over that ancient ""Bharatiya"" knowledge system has a lot to offer to the world which is not meant for any particular sect but the entire humanity. 

It said that is the reason many European countries have promoted Sanskrit and Indic studies in their Universities. Islamic countries like Malaysia and Thailand have Sanskrit study centres and Universities like Harvard and Columbia consider Gita as an important constituent in Management Studies. 

""In Bharat, after the end of British rule, we continued the Macaulian policy of linking English to employment. By terming Sanskrit as a classical language, we have shelved it into temples without touching it in day to day life. 

""So the inscriptions on the walls of Parliament are from ancient Sanskrit texts and all important emblems and mottos of the government departments are inscribed in Sanskrit, but it was not allowed to be a Lingua Franca of  Bharat,"" it said. 

It said since the colonial period some opposed Sanskrit for being a Brahminical language, while others considered it as a religious language of Hindus. 

""Ironically, it was Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and Prof Naziruddin Ahmed in the Constituent Assembly of Bharat who moved a resolution in favour of making Sanskrit a National Language on September 10, 1949, which was rejected by the Congress leadership, again in the name of secularism,"" it said.

Complete corrected text follows. Digital Fly Launches Real Time Social Media Monitoring and Alert Service for Schools 

New Technology Helps Improve School Safety by Tracking Threats, Bullying and More on Twitter and Instagram 

HAUPPAGUE, NY -- Sep 10, 2015 -- Digital Fly today announced the launch of its new real-time social media monitoring and alert service to help K-12 schools improve safety by tracking threats, bullying and more. Digital Fly, the developer and marketer of the technology, is a spinoff of Intelligent Product Solutions (IPS), a leading product development company with offices on Long Island and in Seattle. 

Digital Fly monitors social media and alerts school district officials about potential threats to students, staff members and property. Using geolocation, Digital Fly monitors social media within a 10-mile radius of a school campus, using keywords selected by the school district. For example, search terms could include: guns, drugs, kill, etc. The Digital Fly service also offers a ""tip line"" so that students or parents can report tips anonymously. 

School administrators have real-time access to social media tracking with Digital Fly via a web-based portal, and the service also sends email alerts to notify them of any potential threats. The school administrators can then evaluate the information and determine the best course of action, helping to quickly respond to and prevent any incidents. Additionally, the software allows administrators to search back over a month of data to identify trends. 

""Digital Fly is the first product designed from the ground up for schools, to help them monitor social media as a way to identify potential threats early on and prevent the next incident from happening,"" said Derek Peterson, Founder and Chief Technology Officer. ""It is an important tool not just to stop crime, but also as a tool for administrators to better understand what is going on in their school -- bullying, and other problems. With knowledge comes power -- so that they can identify and proactively deal with any escalating issues."" 

""Our greatest asset is our children, and Digital Fly helps protect students from potential threats,"" added Sal Iannuzzi, CEO of Digital Fly. ""We eliminate the burdensome and time consuming task for school personnel to monitor social media. We monitor the technologies students' use, so administrators can focus on keeping their schools safe."" 

The Digital Fly service is available immediately, and priced based on a per student cost of $1.75 or $3.00 per student, depending on the size of the school. 

Digital Fly monitors information publicly posted on social media, Twitter and now Instagram. The service will also begin monitoring Facebook later this year. 

About Digital Fly

With a strong management team, Sal Iannuzzi recently joined the firm as CEO, bringing his extensive management experience as president and CEO of Monster Worldwide, Inc. and as president and CEO of Symbol Technologies.

He started recording the incident, but ended up catching an amazing little Scottish hero step in and save the day.    2. The audio is hard to hear in the video, but Lachie told BuzzFeed, “He did say that he believed the ‘gay agenda’ would ruin Britain, and he described the LGBT+ community as ‘sinners,’ who he said would burn in hell.”

Yikes. 
   3. A little bit late, the faint sound of bagpipes is heard, and this little boy came in hot to drown out everything the preacher was saying.  
Lachie said, “I uploaded the video not only because it is an excellent response to hate speech in a quintessentially Scottish fashion, but also to highlight the point that discrimination against LGBT+ people is not tolerated by the vast majority of people in the West and that everyday citizens such as the bagpiper are not willing to accept discrimination.” 
   4. The crowd immediately started cheering for the piper, and the man gradually stopped and picked up his things.

Lachie told BuzzFeed, “I hope people take the actions of the piper as inspiration to stand up against discrimination when you see it and to challenge those who would condemn others on the basis of their sexuality, race, or religion.”

By this morning in Munich, 3,600 had already arrived. 

Chancellor Angela Merkel, facing criticism at home, said taking in asylum seekers was ""the right thing to do"" even as her deputy warned that the country was ""reaching the limits"" over how many refugees it could take. 

The latest wave comes two days ahead of a European Union meeting in Brussels on Monday to discuss the migrant crisis triggered by war and economic privation in places such as Syria, Iraq, North Africa and South Asia, and a reluctance by many countries to allow any more in the door. 

The Washington Post reports that thousands of protesters in some parts of Europe have turned out on the streets in central London, ""some with signs that said 'Reject the Politics of Fear,' according to The Guardian.  

Meanwhile, in Prague, thousands gathered for anti-Islam rallies targeted at the migrants, mostly from Muslim countries. 

Hundreds more reportedly came out in Budapest, where many migrants board trains for Germany, to show their support. 

The Associated Press reports: 

 
""Some 450,000 migrants have arrived in Germany this year. The country is expecting at least 800,000 in 2015 — by far the most in the 28-nation EU. 

""The welcome mat for migrants in Germany contrasts sharply with the dangerous seas they faced to get to Greece, the tear gas from Macedonian police, the razor-wire fences, crude migrant camps and burly police in Hungary and, at times, train service shutdowns along the route. ... 

""While Germany has largely welcomed the migrants and a poll this week showed broad support for the government's course, Merkel has faced some criticism from Bavaria's governing party — the Christian Social Union, which is the local sister to her own conservative Christian Democrats.""",Merkel Says Allowing Migrants Into Germany 'Right Thing To Do',News,KERA News,2015-09-12T18:21:00Z

0d02a9ca-e67b-4034-94a3-22db81cce9f2,"A Bridgend meat wholesaler, who faked invoices and falsified business records to steal 428,000 in VAT repayments, has been jailed for three-and-a-half years. 
 
HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) investigators discovered that Lindsey Stoneham, 53, would ask companies for written quotes. He then manipulated the legitimate documents to verify the fictitious payments shown on his VAT returns. Some of the fraudulent invoices related to the construction of buildings that didn't exist, and included 400,000 for constructing agricultural units and 250,000 for the purchase of mobile refrigeration units. 
 
Stoneham was remanded in custody on 18 June after pleading guilty to the fraud between March 2012 and August 2013. He spent a night in police cells for failing to appear at Cardiff Crown Court on 16 June, when Judge Rees issued an arrest warrant. 
 
Colin Spinks, Assistant Director, Fraud Investigation Service, HMRC, said: 
 
""Lindsey Stoneham set out to create a false paper trail to claim money he wasn't entitled to, but he finally faced up to his crimes and pleaded guilty to VAT fraud after initially failing to attend court. We will continue to carry out detailed investigations to bring fraudsters like Stoneham to justice. 
 
""Tax fraud is not a victimless crime; it's theft that robs society of vital funds. Anyone with information about VAT fraud can call the Customs Hotline on 0800 59 5000."" 
 
Upon sentencing, His Honour Judge M Fitton QC, said: 
 
""This was a sophisticated fraud over a period of time and your principal motivation was financial commitments you could not meet."" 
 
The fraud was discovered when a VAT officer became suspicious about Stoneham's monthly VAT returns and referred the case for criminal investigation. He was originally arrested by HMRC investigators at his Bridgend business premises in October 2013. His home was also searched. 
 
HMRC will now seek to recover the proceeds of his crimes.

""Our evaluation team of program experts narrowed the field from 72 original nominations to a field of 23 finalists who exemplified the best in creating value, adapting to complexity, team effectiveness and producing results.""

Rough Notes, the nation's leading source of insurance innovations and trends for over 135 years, recently published two articles about the trucking insurance experts at IMCCA. 

The first article, published in the May 2015 edition of Rough Notes is titled, "" Expertise Key to Trucking and Specialty Trucking Success "". The article explores the challenges that transportation businesses face in identifying, acquiring, and implementing new safety technologies.  As a trucking specialist for many years, Gary Weindorf, President/CEO of IMCCA, points out those safety devices can increase motor carrier costs but can lead to significant dividends in terms of reducing accident frequency, severity and ultimate liability, which can translate into lower insurance premiums. While safety regulations are set forth by the Compliance, Safety, and Accountability (CSA) program, he points out that the organizations which succeed are those that take a proactive approach to vehicle safety and driver security.  A dedicated trucking insurance broker can be an asset in knowing the trucking insurance market and handling unique issues with claims and loss control. 
   
The second article, published in the August 2015 edition of Rough Notes, was featured on the front cover of the magazine. An agency profile - Better to Be Lucky... and Good explores the unconventional path that has brought together the pieces that today comprise the highly successful IMCCA.  Interstate started as a Trucking Agency in 1936 and merged with Capacity Coverage Corp in 2011.  Capacity's original partners, Robert Lull and Mark Weinraub, started the company in 1990 with a goal to create a motor carrier agency that emphasized professionalism and subject matter expertise.  Interstate's trucking expertise was a perfect fit for their vision and maintains their original offices in Freehold, along with a continuation of the same leadership and experienced employees that ensures their clients of market prowess, dedicated service, and the knowledge to assist with shipper/government regulations in this fast-paced industry.

60cd1a10-31ec-4b25-9b0f-049d9d01165f,"Tony Abbott's challenge in the next 48 hours is to match his powerful rhetoric on the world's biggest refugee crisis since World War II with a credible plan of action. Tony Abbott's challenge in the next 48 hours is to match his powerful rhetoric on the world's biggest refugee crisis since World War II with a credible plan of action. He should start by abandoning the idea that Australia can ""play its part"" in the global response without increasing this country's humanitarian intake.

For all the fine and empathetic oratory in Parliament on Monday, there was no retreat from Sunday's repeated assertions that Australia would take more Syrians, but only by taking fewer refugees from elsewhere.

""We always want to do the right thing by people in trouble and we are not going to let people in trouble down now,"" Abbott declared. ""We never have, and we never will!""

But we will be letting people down unless the humanitarian intake is dramatically increased as an emergency measure: the dispossessed in Syria, who are spilling across European borders in their tens of thousands a day, and those who would have been afforded protection if not for this crisis.

Sunday's announcement delivered come-in-spinner ""PM RESCUE MISSION"" headlines in the tabloids, but fell way short of being an adequate response.

That response should take up Labor's proposal for Abbott to convene an emergency meeting of state, community and religious leaders on how the country can accommodate those given protection and the call by the Greens and international agencies for a temporary increase in the order of 20,000 in the humanitarian intake.

Incredibly, Abbott claimed on Sunday that Australia had already done more than any other country to respond to the Syrian humanitarian crisis, saying: ""I am not aware that there is any other country, thus far, which has taken 4500 people through the UNHCR from this region.""

But we haven't taken them, yet. We have committed to providing at least 4500 visas to Syrians over the next three years and made a positive start.

""Though that may sound like a substantial increase, it equates to about 1500 visas per year, which is a reduction of nearly 1000 visas from 2014-15 levels,"" says a blog by the parliamentary library from earlier this year.

By way of comparison, Germany has so far committed to accept a further 35,000 Syrian refugees under alternative forms of humanitarian admission. Another 70,000 places have been offered by other countries, but this is a tiny fraction of the more than 4 million registered Syrian refugees.

Despite repeatedly ruling out an increase in the humanitarian intake, Abbott has now left open the prospect of a response commensurate with Australia's reaction to previous crises, which he rightly holds up as a source of national pride.

He intends to listen to what advice Immigration Minister Peter Dutton receives from the people on the spot and has expressed confidence that Parliament will ultimately speak with one strong and generous voice. That will involve a quantum and necessary leap from the minimalist position he adopted over the weekend.

Bobby Brown has spoken publicly about his daughter for the first time since her death almost two months ago. 
 
Appearing on the daytime talk show “The Real,” the singer opened up about the loss of Bobbi Kristina, his daughter with his ex-wife, the late Whitney Houston. 
 
“We prayed and hoped for six months for something better to happen,” Brown said. “But when God calls you, he calls you.” 
 
The 22-year-old died in July after being found face down in the bathtub at her home outside Atlanta in January. Her father said his fondest memory is of her smile. 
 
“I mean not just because we have the same smile, the same gap and everything, but her smile and just her graciousness with loving people,” he said. “She was so kindhearted. She always took care of her friends.” 
 
He said he believed Houston, who died in 2012, wanted their daughter to be with her. 
 
“I’m pretty sure her mother…had a part with like, ‘Come on, let’s get her up here’ — in the best way possible,” Brown said. 
 
Brown was joined on the show by his current wife, Alicia Etheredge, and said he’s creating the Bobbi Kristina Serenity House, which will be a center for victims of domestic violence. He said life since his daughter’s death has been an “everyday process.” 
 
“God was gracious enough to give me a baby girl (his daughter Bodhi with Etheredge) in the last two months, you know, after losing one,” Brown said.

As soon as it was announced that the former England and Manchester United star would be in town to open the new Adidas store in the mall ‘Beckhamania’ has been in overdrive in Dubai. 
 
Beckham said: “I always love coming to Dubai – it’s a special place that’s constantly evolving. Spending some time here, it was great to get a sense of the energy people have for sport.” 
 
Fans waited from the morning to catch a glimpse of their hero and some of the lucky ones even got the chance to meet him. Osama Khalid (pictured, above) is a member of the Red Maniacs supporters’ club in the UAE and he had his Beckham No. 7 shirt signed by the former United midfielder. 
 
“We have a fan club which has been running since 2007,” said Khalid. “We are really growing now. 
 
“I had never heard of United until August 17, 1996 when Beckham scored that goal from halfway [against Wimbledon]. “My nephew was born at that time so it was pretty special meeting him.” 
 
Virginia Chiarentin was also delighted to meet Beckham and even got to ask him what he thought about Dubai. 
 
“It was absolutely amazing,” said the 17-year-old. “He said he was really happy to be in Dubai and thanked us for coming as well so it was amazing.” 
 
Ayaan Nadeem, 11, from Dubai, added: “That was my dream. He’s always been my role model. Who couldn’t love him?”

The remains were found last month when contractors were tearing down the cabin, which had been abandoned for more than a decade. Workers found skeletal remains of Joshua Vernon Maddux, who was 18 when he was reported missing in May 2008. 

Teller County Coroner Al Born says the teen lived less than a mile from the abandoned cabin and was probably trying to shimmy down the chimney when he got stuck. Maddux hadn't been reported as a runaway.

3aae9955-3f67-4af2-8bc9-eedaebe93ddd,"England arrived in Manchester determined to put the controversy of Ben Stokes' Lord's dismissal behind them - and do themselves justice for the first time in the Royal London Series. 
 
There will be no more chances, if the third match of five also goes awry for the hosts at Emirates Old Trafford on Tuesday, to stop England's Ashes-winning summer ending with a whimper. 
 
The fall-out from Stokes' departure in Saturday's failed Lord's run chase against Australia is an extra complicating factor the hosts could do without. 
 
Stokes himself has voiced his hopes that no further ""bad blood"" results, after rival captains Eoin Morgan and Steve Smith made clear their disagreement at the weekend. 
 
The all-rounder has spelled out too that he was simply trying to protect himself from Mitchell Starc's shy at the stumps when he contorted in mid-air but intercepted the attempted run-out with an outstretched left hand. 
 
England coach Trevor Bayliss has congratulated Stokes for his measured response to the controversy. 
 
There is a bigger picture for the Australian to address too, though, in three must-win matches as England seek to put their post-World Cup revival back on track. 
 
""We may have gone into our shells just a little bit,"" he said, comparing two performances in defeat against Australia to the form England showed in a thrilling 3-2 success over New Zealand in the series immediately preceding his tenure. 
 
""It's a bit of a juggling act. 
 
""Being positive and aggressive to me is not (just) hitting fours and sixes. 
 
""It's that mental positive and aggressive approach. 
 
""I think we ... maybe forgot what is our gameplan now, given this is the way they're bowling to us now."" 
 
Bayliss believes England's bowlers have room for improvement.

""I think we have gone for a few too many runs,"" he added. 
 
""We have probably over-pitched too much in the first couple of games and let the Australians hit easy fours. 
 
""We have bowled some very easy four balls - long half-volleys and long-hops. 
 
""We have to make it as difficult as possible for opposition batters score runs ... we have to bowl to our field better than we have done."" 
 
He insists, though, that defeat against the World Cup holders will not be a disaster. 
 
""You can't go jumping at the loss of one or two games, or a series or two,"" he said.

28c5e4ad-b694-4c5a-b287-75eb907c79e8,"Super-subs Fernando Torres and Angel Correa struck to give Atletico Madrid a 2-0 win away to Eibar on Saturday Diego Simeone's side missed a handful of chances in the first half with Jackson Martinez particularly wasteful but Correa's fine finish just a minute after coming on gave them the lead 

The home side battled for a way back into the match but Torres who was introduced at half-time clipped a deft finish into the far corner following Correa's pass to secure the victory and send Atletico to within a point of La Liga leaders Real Madrid 

Luciano Vietto starting in the three-pronged attack alongside Jackson and Antoine Griezmann brought the first save out of Asier Riesgo with a low shot from distance Griezmann's corner was headed towards the bottom corner of the net by Jose Maria Gimenez but his effort was blocked and Eibar were able to clear before Jackson's placed effort from inside the box was well saved by Riesgo 

Eibar looked dangerous on the break and Saul Berjon tested Jan Oblak from one quick breakaway before Atletico spurned their first clear-cut chance of the half Koke's flighted ball was turned back across goal by Jackson but Vietto failed to connect properly at the far post with the goal at his mercy and he managed only to ripple the side-netting 

Filipe Luis was bailed out by Gimenez's headed clearance after he totally misjudged a long ball up to Keko and Jackson was denied by a smart block from Ander Capa following Griezmann's clever reverse pass 

The Colombian was inches away from connecting with the lively Griezmann's fizzed cross and Vietto saw a header comfortably held as Atleti began to take control towards the end of the half 

Fernando Torres and Oliver Torres replaced Jackson and Vietto at the break but it was Filipe Luis who came close to breaking the deadlock Riesgo diving superbly to claw his deflected strike from distance behind for a corner 

Oblak was called into action to deny Berjon at the near post a few moments later and the stop proved pivotal as Atleti took the lead just past the hour mark 

Torres battled to win a hopeful ball over the top and he teed up Correa who dummied superbly before firing past Riesgo from inside the area for his first goal for the club - and all just a minute after being brought on for Koke 

Oliver dragged a shot wide after some fine footwork as Atleti pushed for a second but Oblak was called into action to deny Sergi Enrich following a long ball upfield 

Atleti doubled their advantage after 77 minutes Correa turned provider with a clever throughball to Torres who chipped it over the onrushing Riesgo and into the far corner

WASHINGTON – Conservative commentator Ann Coulter isn’t shedding any tears for departing Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio. 
    
In the same breath, she managed to identify President Obama and Pope Francis as political soul mates after Boehner was seen on television openly weeping as Pope Francis addressed Congress Thursday.

Gauging what it means for the country, Coulter immediately added that if GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump “gets the nomination, Republicans are going to have to vote for the GOP across the board, one more time, to give Trump a Republican Congress.” 
 
However, along with her call for Republican solidarity, Coulter sees no reason for conservatives to let up the pressure on the GOP establishment. 
 
“Of course, that doesn’t mean we can’t have a few targeted primaries, like Frank Roche running against open borders/Kevin McCarthy-friend/Zuckerberg-pet Renee Elmers in North Carolina.” 
 
Establishment Republican and incumbent Rep. Renee Elmers, R-N.C., defeated conservative Roche in the GOP primary for the 2nd Congressional District of North Carolina in 2014. He is running against her again in 2016. 
 
As next in line in the power structure, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was immediately viewed as Boehner’s likely successor. He is considered part of the GOP establishment, often at odds with House conservatives who want to fight Obama administration efforts more vigorously. 
 
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. 
 
Conservatives such as Coulter consider McCarthy as too weak on efforts to seal the border with Mexico. They are especially wary after he, along with Boehner, met with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, an amnesty advocate who claims Silicon Valley needs more foreign workers, despite a glut of trained Americans. 
 
As WND reported in July, only one in four Americans with a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) degree is in a STEM job, according to data from the U.S. Census. 
 
Critics say technology bosses such as Zuckerberg just want more cheap labor. 
 
Fed up with what they considered Boehner’s ineffective attempts to effectively fight against Obama’s executive amnesty, conservatives attempted to oust Boehner during speaker elections held after the historic landslide Republican victory in the House in the 2014 midterm election. 
 
In July, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C, offered a motion to oust Boehner, a measure that still technically looms over the speaker’s head, but apparently is now moot. 
 
As WND reported Friday , Boehner was facing the dilemma of whether to attempt to defund Planned Parenthood in the upcoming budget bill and risk a government shutdown, as conservatives demanded, or face a revolt.

6be303a9-729f-4ad4-9562-d8547eca8691,"By 2 September 2015 Ward: “largest opportunity” so far for Clerksroom

National chambers Clerksroom has announced a partnership with a not-for-profit business that describes itself as the biggest multi-sector ombudsman in the UK, to provide commercial dispute resolution services for up to 2,000 businesses.

Ombudsman Services (OS) provides private sector dispute resolution services to tens of thousands of consumers across the country every year, particularly in the energy, property and communications sectors.

OS is launching a new service today, in partnership with Clerksroom, for disputes between companies. Ombudsman Services Business to Business aims to cover “a wide spectrum of disputes from late payments to multi-million pound settlements”.

Stephen Ward, chief executive of Clerksroom, said more than 2,000 businesses, including almost all the major utility companies, would be invited by the OS to direct commercial disputes to the new service.

Mr Ward predicted that Clerksroom, which works with over 500 mediation specialists, might have to recruit 10-20 full-time administrators to cope with the demands of running the scheme.

“We know there will be a lead-in time of three, six or nine months and we are preparing our office for what we will hope will be rapid expansion,” he said.

“I’m expecting a large number of mediators wanting to join us when this becomes public. This is the largest opportunity that we’ve ever encountered and we’re all very excited about it.”

Mr Ward said he knew of at least one major gas supplier which would definitely add a clause in its terms and conditions referring disputes to the new service.

He claimed that Clerksroom was the only dispute resolution network that could “meet the anticipated nationwide demand for this service”.

Mr Ward added that the partnership could also boost Clerksroom’s direct access barrister service, as businesses which could not come to an agreement would be signposted to it by the OS website.

“Businesses are ideal public access clients,” he said. “The whole thing sits together extremely neatly.”

Lewis Shand Smith, chief executive of OS, said it already handled many disputes between commercial businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises in the energy, communications, music recording and property sectors.

“We find that as we grow, we are being asked more frequently to provide services outside the scope of our existing product portfolio and as such have decided to introduce a new commercial dispute resolution service to bring our wealth of experience to businesses.

“We are committed to helping businesses resolve their complaints and find a way to get their problems resolved without incurring the high costs of going to court, and hope that many businesses will take advantage of the new service we are offering.”

Clerksroom announced early last month that it had signed a signed a two-year contract, together with Parklane Plowden, to provide barristers for all Minster Law’s personal injury fast and multi-track cases.

42a79993-a110-4c27-b642-10aec8790fb3,"Project Description FROM THE YALE TEAM: 
Sustainable design for living
is often approached as a collection of technologies, isolating the
home from its occupant and the environment instead of working with natural
climatic conditions. This attitude assumes the home and outdoors should be
completely separate, that the interior always requires mechanical conditioning,
and that the house itself is a sealed bubble in a hostile environment. 

Y-House seeks to approach sustainable design from a
holistic mindset, creating a space that is fully integrated with exterior
spaces, community, and climatic conditions. 

Our rapid and agile lifestyles demand a house that is also able to respond to
our changing needs. Specifically targeted at young professionals, Y-House
provides adaptability, multi-functionality and freedom of movement beyond the
walls of a house. Simple, electricity-free measures provide the first means to
maintain a comfortable living environment: a linear configuration optimizes
natural ventilation so that most of the time, opening a window provides
sufficient air flow; open interior spaces provide abundant natural day lighting
so that electrical lighting is rarely required; a large patio doubles
the living space so that when occupants want to socialize, they have a space to
do so. When these measures are not sufficient, Y-House is prepared. Adequate
building science and construction techniques assure that energy transfer is
minimal when desired. Use of energy-efficient mechanical equipment provides for
the needs of the house at a minimum energy penalty, and mechanical
equipment monitors air quality so that measures such as opening a window do not
interfere with heating or cooling. Furthermore, the modular structure can be
easily retrofitted for future technologies so Y-House remains relevant as
systems continue to improve. 

Through Y-House, it is our aim to inspire
social and environmental change by making sustainable housing desirable and
marketable to a new generation. By implementing a design-based,
multi-disciplinary approach, Y-House allows for simpler solutions that make
this change possible.  

MINIMAL FOOTPRINT: Through a
square footage of just under 750 square feet, our design achieves reduced
material costs and energy loads while still enabling the impression of
spaciousness through outdoor integration. An exterior deck draws people
outdoors while minimizing preconditioned space. 

NATURAL VENTILATION: With its
linear configuration, natural ventilation is maximized across the north-south
axis of the house. The central room additionally creates a pressure
differential that pushes this air through interior spaces. Operable vents above
the kitchen and bathroom areas allow for hot air to escape, lowering mechanical
cooling loads. 

AIR QUALITY: Although the
competition does not measure air quality, Team Yale felt that this was a key
component in making a house a comfortable. The demand-based energy recovery
ventilator paired with two membrane layers enable the walls to breathe and
release moisture, preventing mold and sick house syndrome. 

OUTER ENVELOPE SCREEN: The
outer louvered screens serves two key purposes in the Y-House design: the louvers
are specifically matched to the house’s facade orientation to minimize solar
heat gain, and the extension of the screens beyond the house connect interior
spaces to the outside. 

HEAT RECOVERY: To account for
the 12% of the time when CA temperature falls outside ideal conditions, Team
Yale is featuring demand-based energy recovery. When the house is full of
people and running appliances, the ERV removes this excess heat to cool the
house while a heat pump hot water system uses this heat for hot water. 

MODULAR CONSTRUCTION:
Efficiency lies not only in the house itself, but in the process of building
it. Standard construction takes months of manpower, large amounts of fuel in
shipping materials, and excess waste. By designing the Y-House to break down into
two standard-sized modules for modular construction assembly, the Y-House will
take only one month to construct. 

COMMUNAL GARDEN: The home of
the future is not an isolated, enclosed shell, but rather an open environment
that incorporates the outside world. The Y-House is part of this larger
community, and has been designed to maximize social spaces and shared
resources. The communal garden incorporates a variety of drought-tolerant
plants the minimize water usage while providing a natural aesthetic. 

ADAPTABILITY: Team Yale
understands that in order for the Y-House to remain relevant, it has to be
adaptable. A double wall and drop ceiling enable piping, wiring and ductwork to
be swapped out without penetrating the envelope of the house. A modular
mechanical core can actually be plugged into the house to allow easy changes
for future systems.",2015 Solar Decathlon: Y-House,News,Architect Magazine,2015-09-01T17:20:36Z

Is that it's straight ahead Michael is it's written on the wall I heretic but I think there there are cameras and make here is our. It. The last time we saw you on the field. You do some things I. We haven't seen you do much if at all they had you inside. Rob Ninkovich with your hand on the ground is that. First oh how is that for you and second is that something we can expect to see is that look that word we're looking forward to. Yes I I enjoyed plan as Mars. A third it's got a three technique plan a didn't attack basically bomb but it is very productive and it helps our team so. As you can help our team I'm off for mall for for sure and I like him I enjoyed doing it and retton did down there for should be done. Yeah I think Toobin and bill talks a lot about positional versatility. And it's one of those things the more you can use them more. You can play and more and be out there right that's right that at that way coaches from day one you know. Bombed the Maury can do the better and it's it's about what you can do so I think he's implant these incidents and even to tackle. It's they help the team makes him makes him more flexible for defense and I'm off for. Some people are really you know fourth for the first game I there's so many routines. That players go through. I'll wonder what yours is yours for game one and how it compares to where you are now in your career and and your first NFL game with the patriots. Yeah well on their routines and rituals I'm very I'm very superstitious. I'm Patricia is a lot of guys out of superstitious. But I'm very superstitious when it comes to routine and pregame routines. But it's it's definitely altered throughout the years from our refused to now. On this some things that I do do the same. Like always likes if we edit but it's okay it's 7 o'clock games haven't there again. Tom I'll get to stay in around 2 o'clock to 3 o'clock which is early for me on against him taleo my pants and foam pads and in. Mean isn't it in my my mellow music in the hot. All those things they don't change that's that's preparation for the games bomb. But I remembered announce a certain to certain things that I eat you know sometimes I have a stake in some Gatorade is mashed potatoes on the some that heavy Bud Light at mount not too much of it was just a good amount just to Sylvia. I really don't eat much on game day and I'm professor athlete but I still get the juniors instigators of these so bomb might have that's not really there bush gift for the most part keep the same routine. My nerves from what that we Rudy get nervous about you as you're going through your mind nervous about. If you have the and we talked but I fear if you have the assignments down it was that the opponent or is it just. It's stage fright of who what where there are unlikely assignments it's easier for maybe that was more of a risky thing. Maybe being more nerves and opponents are are just excitement. But on his left that I cases the pressure I put on myself to do good. On I'd I'd take the sport in my profession very seriously. My approach to practice field in expressing game because that's what matters the most. Armed so my assembly out of may have used a roller by same nervousness. But when I go out there I put that pressure on myself to do good and I wanna do good each and every play him being consistent so. Those are the jitters like all right so maybe maybe at this first Islamic that's when I kind of loosen up a little bit and they are this is my time on good thing. Now after after the plane and playoff games and Super Bowl and what's it like playing in an eight and on national TV game like this one we you know you're the only. Showing it in the entire country does that affect you would tolerate you. You don't seem bigger games and so it's just another you know sixty minutes of football. Yeah it does you know and oust Al Al did a lot of classic appearances it does it is in effect a player you know your professional at the lights are and and our. Orbited around social media and in the TV and I watch TV I'm on social media so humbling you have a game like this it's a prime time game might be a disposable. On its author and on every channel ESPN UMB watch and Cartoon Network also Mosley you know so. I'm. I feel like you just need to block it out when it's time believe that's again it's I think it's far I mean it's all over TV it's all over here and you're gonna see is so. If you have to to mellowed down to know when the peak. Now as we were coming back from break in the music's playing in your plane in the air drops I was and you were gone pretty get I gotta admit that he and and you said. You're listening to mellow music before you blog and play here that would be just the opposite of what I would have just actresses so you saw me hit in the air drums.

750d10c7-d86d-4cf5-84fb-4229222c20b3,"The United States saw an increase in the number of children caught crossing the southern border in August, according to numbers released by U.S. Border Patrol on Monday. 

According to that data, its agents apprehended 4,506 children that month, an 8 percent increase from July. That number, however, is still far below the huge numbers that were part of the unaccompanied minor crisis during the summer of 2014. At its peak, authorities then were apprehending more than 10,000 children a month. 

Still, the White House said it was concerned with the numbers. 

“We take this issue very seriously,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during his press briefing. “We’re going to continue to be engaged in both trying to stem that flow, but also messaging very clearly to people in Central America who may be thinking about trying to help their child to get into the United States, to urge them not to subject their child to that dangerous journey.” 

In a statement, Customs and Border Protection said the number of children trying to cross the border was being driven by misinformation given to them by smugglers, as well as continued violence in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. 

“Overall, the number of UAC apprehensions in 2015 remains significantly lower compared to the number of apprehensions through August of last year, with a 46 percent decrease,” CBP said in a statement. “Total apprehensions across our entire Southwest border remain at near-historic lows.” 

U.S. authorities also saw an increase in the apprehension of families. In August, 5,158 families were apprehended, an 11 percent increase from July.

""I strongly believe we'll see a major shift in these numbers. Businesses across the board may find themselves more vulnerable to an audit and subject to sizable penalties for not accurately tracking and accurately paying nonexempt employees for all hours worked,"" said Mike Trabold 

The annual survey asked respondents ""How do you input the hours you work at your place of employment?"" Nearly 33 percent of respondents indicated they weren't required to input any of their hours worked, while 22 percent indicated they input their work hours on a time sheet. The Department of Labor has proposed changes to the executive, administrative, and professional (EAP) exemptions under the Fair Labor Standards Act that would make nearly 5 million additional employees eligible for overtime pay by doubling the minimum salary required for exemption from overtime, from $455 

""Business owners relying on paper time sheets that are open to human error and those not requiring employees to track hours at all should be thinking differently before the final rule is published and becomes effective. Businesses relying on technology to track employee time and attendance will likely become the new norm, due in large part to increased government regulation,"" said Trabold.

Over 23 percent of the participants responded that they input their hours on a desktop or laptop computer. Nearly 10 percent indicated that they input hours via a badge or card reader, while nearly 12 percent were split between various other electronic methods.

The ""Getting Paid In America"" survey was held in conjunction with APA's annual public awareness campaign, National Payroll Week (NPW). Over 34,800 employees responded to the survey, providing insight into how workers are paid in America. For complete results, visit www.nationalpayrollweek.com.

INDIANAPOLIS — Republican Gov. Mike Pence is in Japan for a week-long mission meant to drum up investment in Indiana by touting its business-friendly climate. 
 
The trip, which kicks off with a Sunday reception in Tokyo, is being paid for by a coterie of powerful interests that sent representatives who will join the governor and first lady Karen Pence during cultural exchanges and business meetings with major manufacturers including Honda, Toyota, Mitsubishi and Subaru. 
 
Pence has long maintained that these international trips — this is his seventh — are crucial to attracting new businesses and jobs to the state at no cost to taxpayers. 
 
Critics say those who donate the money to the Indiana Economic Development Corporation that goes toward funding these trips, among other things, are purchasing outsized influence at the expense of the public good. 
 
Some things to know about Pence's trip: 
 
ALL ABOARD 
 
The IEDC budgeted $280,000 for the 40-member trade delegation, which departed Friday and is heavily represented by energy interests, including representatives from Duke Energy, Indiana Michigan Power, Hoosier Energy and the Vectren Corporation. Two cultural ambassadors from the Japan-America Society of Indiana also traveled with the group, as did several municipal officials, other state officials and guards from Pence's security detail. 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
 
Supporters of such trade missions say they are an invaluable way to make friends and connections while promoting the state. Pence said one reason he was going to Japan was because more than 250 Japanese businesses operate in Indiana, employing thousands while bringing millions in investment to the state. 
 
COZY RELATIONSHIPS 
 
Most of the companies represented on the trip also helped finance Pence's previous trade missions at home and abroad, donating roughly $2.1 million to the cause since 2014, records show. ""I think it says that it's yet another opportunity for special interests and their big money to build relationships with government officials,"" says Julia Vaughn, policy director for Common Cause Indiana, a left leaning citizens' advocacy group. ""It's a business decision. It's an investment in positive relationship with this administration."" 
 
PAST TRAVEL 
 
Since 2014, Pence's trips abroad have cost an estimated $880,000, which has been paid for through donations made to the IEDC's fundraising organization. In 2014, he visited Germany, London and Toronto, where he treated guests to an NHL game. This year, before going to Japan, Pence visited Israel and China, which cost about $310,000, total. On a recent domestic ""jobs mission,"" Pence treated his business relocation prospects and his entourage of state envoys to a $24,000 outing at a Yankees baseball game in New York.",Pence jobs mission to Japan funded by private donors,News,Greenfield Daily Reporter,2015-09-12T15:03:34Z

07ee4ad9-80df-4b4a-9c7d-83e560185394,"New York (AFP) - Wall Street stocks rose in opening trade Wednesday as the markets digested a weak reading on consumer prices ahead of a key Federal Reserve interest rate decision.

Five minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 16,639.80, up 39.95 points (0.24 percent).

The broad-based S&P 500 advanced 5.04 (0.25 percent) to 1,983.13, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index added 9.81 (0.20 percent) at 4,870.33.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index fell 0.1 percent in August, dragged lower by tumbling gasoline prices. 

The fresh data signalled a continued lack of inflationary pressure that would support the Fed undertaking its first rate hike in more than nine years.

Traders see a 30 percent chance the Fed will raise interest rates Thursday, up from 25 percent Tuesday morning, said a note from Wells Fargo Advisors.","Dow edges up, Nasdaq dips as Fed meeting looms",News,Yahoo! News,2015-09-16T14:11:13Z

Fan fights over the internet are quite common. While Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan fans are at loggerheads all the time, in Tamil cinema Ajith and Vijay fans don’t miss an opportunity to  bring down the other star. 
 
In Tollywood, the rivalry between Pawan Kalyan fans and Mahesh Babu fans has led to many ugly online fights in the past. But it looks like Pawan fans have found a new rival in terms of Prabhas’ fans. After the mega success of Baahubali, Prabhas’s popularity has reached sky high and he now has millions of die hard fans.  On the occasion of Power Star’s birthday, a major scuffle broke between Pawan fans and Prabhas fans at Bheemavaram town of Andhra Pradesh. 
 
The fight turned ugly and physical as stones were pelted between the two fan bases. After Pawan Kalyan fans found out that someone had removed and destroyed their superstar’s banners, which were placed on the occasion of his 44th birthday!  Soon the blame fell on Prabhas’ fans and an huge fight broke between the two groups. Pawan fans also burned Prabhas’s posters from Baahubali for the sake of revenge. Police had to intervene to calm the two fan groups. 
 
Wonder what Pawan Kalyan and Prabhas would have to say to this unruly behaviour by their fans?

33844898-253a-44d6-bf92-1ebf509023dd,"The number of Australians starting an apprenticeship or traineeship plummeted by 20 per cent over the past year, but there are strong signs for traditional trades such as building and plumbing. The number of Australians starting an apprenticeship or traineeship plummeted by 20 per cent over the past year, but there are strong signs for traditional trades such as building and plumbing. Apprenticeship and training commencements fell to 190,200 in the 12 months up to March, a 19.8 per cent decline on the previous year. There were approximately 320,000 apprentices and trainees at the end of March, down 16.4 per per cent on March 2014, according to the National Centre for Vocational Education Research (NCVER).

The number of people starting training in NSW slipped by 24.6 per cent and by 21.6 per cent in Victoria.

The long-term decline is due to subdued business confidence and the removal of subsidies by the previous Labor government three years ago, an NCVER spokeswoman said.

The downturn was significantly worse in non-trades training - including retail, clerical and hospitality - than traditional trades such as building, plumbing and electrical work.

In fact, the number of Australians starting trades training has increased for four consecutive quarters.

Trades commencements increased by 7.2 per cent in the March quarter compared to the previous year - the first time in two decades the number of people commencing a trades apprenticeship outstripped non-trades.

Assistant Minister for Education and Training Simon Birmingham said the resurgence in the traditional trades was welcome, but that more needed to be done to boost Australia's skilled workforce.

""Further reform will be required to reverse the decline in commencements that began when Gillard government cuts to employer incentive payments precipitated a decline in the number of apprentices in training by around 200,000,"" he said.

Opposition spokeswoman for vocational education Sharon Bird said the Abbott government had cut $1 billion from apprenticeship programs.

""There has not been one policy put forward by the Abbott government that increases investment in apprentices to help them start and complete an apprenticeship,"" she said.

The head of the Business Council of Australia, Catherine Livingstone, has said that too many young Australians are entering university and that more should begin in the vocational education system.

A recent report by the Mitchell Institute for Health and Education Policy found that funding for vocational education has lagged behind that for universities and schools. Vocational education funding has increased just 5 per cent over the past decade compared to 40 per cent for higher education and 25 per cent for schools.

DUBLIN 

The Global Molecular Diagnostics 2010-2015 report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why companies enter molecular diagnostics partnering deals. These deals tend to be multicomponent, starting with collaborative R&D, and commercialization of outcomes. 

This report provides details of the latest molecular diagnostics agreements announced in the healthcare sectors. 

Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered - contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not. 

This report contains a comprehensive listing of all molecular diagnostics partnering deals announced since 2010 including financial terms where available including over 300 links to online deal records of actual molecular diagnostics partnering deals as disclosed by the deal parties. In addition, where available, records include contract documents as submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission by companies and their partners. 

Contract documents provide the answers to numerous questions about a prospective partner's flexibility on a wide range of important issues, many of which will have a significant impact on each party's ability to derive value from the deal. 

For example, analyzing actual company deals and agreements allows assessment of the following: 

A popular chapter with readers chapter 3 covers the average financial deal terms for deals signed in the molecular diagnostics field with a stage of development announced. Deals are listed and sectioned by average headlines, upfront payments, milestone payments and royalty rates. The median values of these deals are then presented by stage of development at signing. Numerous tables and figures are weaved within the report to support the findings and illustrate the trends and activities in molecular diagnostics partnering and dealmaking since 2010. 

Chapter 4 covers the leading cancer diagnostics deals that have been announced over the past five years. Deals are listed by headline value. Where the deal has an agreement contract published at the SEC a link provides online access to the contract. Full deal contract documents where available for each deal are indicated by a yes/no symbol. Within this chapter the most active molecular diagnostics deal makers are also listed as well as the deal making activities and the number of deals entered into by the big pharma companies. 

Chapter 5 acts as a contracts reference directory chapter providing a full comprehensive and detailed list of the cancer diagnostics partnering deals signed and announced since January 2010 

Chapter 6 brings the report to a conclusion by looking ahead to the future of molecular diagnostics partnering. Newly introduced to provide readers with potential prospects and partnering insights this chapter selects emerging companies to watch in 2015 and details their recent deal making and financial activities. These companies could be potential targets for those who want to invest or partner in the coming months. 

In conclusion, this report gives prospective dealmakers a thorough overview of all the deals announced in the molecular diagnostics field preparing them with everything they need to know about partnering in the research, development and commercialization of cancer diagnostics technologies and products. 

A full appendix is provided at the very end of the report which lists all the cancer diagnostics deals announced since 2010 categorized by company A-Z, deal type, stage of development, technology and therapy. Where available contract documents are supplied, these documents include additional deal information in comparison to only the brief summary that is provided through a press release.

17d16a39-37fd-4516-bb59-2e832ea34c4c,"The FIFA 16 ratings for the very best players in the world have been released this week, and having gone from 50-21, here is the list that everyone has been waiting for, the top 20 players in the world: 

20. Philipp Lahm  



The Bayern Munich man continues to guide the Bundesliga side to success, and was the captain as Germany went on to win last year’s World Cup. 

19. Luka Modric  



For all their attacking flair, it is the control and consistency that the former Tottenham man has brought that has allowed Real Madrid to destroy opponents further up the pitch. 

18. Mesut Ozil 



Despite appearing to be quite a lazy player, there are few in the game as clever as the Arsenal playmaker. His passing in particular, is a joy to watch at times. 

17. Sergio Ramos 



It is unsurprising, based on his rating, that Man United tried to bring him to Old Trafford this summer. Equally, it is little surprise that Real Madrid did everything they could to keep him. 

16. Cesc Fabregas 



Although he has been off the boil this season, there is little question of the Spaniard’s ability to pick out the kind of pass that will create a goal. 

15. Jerome Boateng 



It may have been one of the iconic images of last season when the Germany defender could only tumble to the ground as Lionel Messi glided past him in a Champions League game, but the World Cup winner remains one of the best centre-backs in the game. 

14. Toni Kroos 



The Real Madrid man is one of the most gifted passers in the game, and is making himself undroppable in a star-studded Los Blancos side. 

13. James Rodriguez 



Having shone at last year’s World Cup, where he finished the tournament as top scorer, he got his move to Real Madrid and has taken little time to find his feet. 

12. Sergio Aguero 



Manchester City’s talisman was the Premier League’s top goalscorer last season, and has helped the Citizens make a blistering start to this campaign. 

11. Andres Iniesta 



The 31-year-old continues to prove that class is permanent, having guided a Barcelona side that appeared to be in something of a transition, to an amazing treble. 

10. David Silva 



When Manuel Pellegrini’s side were struggling last season, Silva was one of the few players that continued to turn out stunning performances. The continuation of that form has helped City set the early pace in the top flight. 

9. Thiago Silva 



The Paris Saint-Germain captain was instrumental as Laurent Blanc’s side went on to claim a domestic treble last season. 

8. Neymar 



The Brazilian is the first of Barcelona’s amazing front three to appear on the list. And given how well he played last year, it would not be a surprise if he is much higher on the list when FIFA 17 arrives. 

7. Zlatan Ibrahimovic 



The 33-year-old continues to impress, and more importantly, regularly find the back of the net, which would suggest that he could continue playing at the highest level for several years yet. 

6. Eden Hazard 



The Belgian is the Premier League’s highest rated player, having been awarded several individual accolades after guiding Chelsea to the title last season. 

5. Arjen Robben 



He may be injury-prone but the former Chelsea man continues to cause mayhem on the wing, and has already opened his account for the new season. 

4. Manuel Neuer 



Much like Peter Schmeichel previously, the Bayern Munich man has rewritten the blueprint of what a goalkeeper could, and should, be. He has conceded just once in the Bundesliga this season. 

3. Luis Suarez 



The former Liverpool striker hit new heights during his first season at the Nou Camp, and kicked Barca’s campaign off this time around with the winner against Athletic Bilbao. 

2. Cristiano Ronaldo 



Despite finishing with an astonishing 48 goals in La Liga last season, the Real Madrid star misses out on top spot to his old rival. 

1. Lionel Messi 



It says something about how special Lionel Messi was last season when some are calling it his best year. The treble was largely down to him, and thus, he takes his place at the very top of the game.

Jenna Jameson and Farrah Abraham strip as housemates learn of fake eviction 

The bitchy duo were kicked out of the house on Friday and moved into a much cosier nest next-door where they've been watching their former housemates pull out the daggers and obliterate them over and over again. 

After a weekend of believing they have the upper hand, the tables are about to turn on the US stars as the remaining contestants have been sneakily informed of the pair's whereabouts. 

While both Farrah and Jenna strip off for a sensual naked massage, Big Brother revealed they've been watching the housemate's every move on a monitor next door. 

For the first time ever, Big Brother have double-bluffed the fake evictees who will presumably re-enter the house later this week. Housemates were gathered on the sofa's where Big Brother played out the entire sequence - from their 'eviction' to cackling at the house from their secret den.

f3ed5983-03fb-439f-9495-fc0841b9990a,"Strictly Come Dancing star Kristina Rihanoff has said online abuse about her love life left her feeling ""suicidal"".

The Russian dancer dated boxer Joe Calzaghe after she partnered him on the show, splitting in 2013 after four years, while she earlier dated Strictly professional Vincent Simone.

She has previously hit out at critics after she had to insist that nothing had gone on between herself and Ben Cohen after being blamed for the rugby star's marriage split.

The 37-year-old dancer told the Sun: ""I felt suicidal at that point in my life. I was having such dark thoughts - and I'm not a person who gives up easily.

""I know I'm strong but the abuse ... it just destroyed me emotionally. I couldn't find a single positive thing to tell myself.""

The star also revealed that she took the decision in 2013 to carry on with the hit BBC One series in the knowledge that her relationship with Calzaghe would ""fall to pieces"".

""I also had to be ready to quit dancing, something that had been part of my life since I was six years old. And I didn't feel ready to sacrifice my work,"" she added. 

""By accepting the next series of Strictly, I knew this would potentially be the final nail in the coffin for my relationship with Joe."" 

In June Rihanoff told Loose Women: ""I didn't go in to the show to have my private life splashed all over the papers."" 

And she added: ""I just don't understand why women are played against each other so badly.""

The star partners Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell in this year's series and their waltz routine split the judges in Friday's opening show.

e394fa29-afee-421b-8423-4f1555522df5,"A High Court judge has been asked to get involved in the argument about whether the card game bridge is a sport or a game.

Mr Justice Dove will hear arguments about the issue at a High Court hearing in London over the next two days.

At the heart of the row is a question of money.

If bridge is deemed to be a sport, then it will be eligible for a number of grants and competitions exempt from VAT payment.

But if the status remains as it is, then HMRC will continue to be quids in.

The English Bridge Union (EBU) brought the action after Sport England said it would not agree that the card game was a sport.

""Sport England refused to recognise bridge as a sport, a position which the EBU believes to be inconsistent with both the wishes of Parliament, and the opinion of significant international sporting organisations,"" said an EBU spokesman.

""When ruling on what constituted a sport in the 2011 Charities Act, Parliament specifically included 'mind sports', stating that sport comprised 'activities which promote health involving physical or mental skill or exertion'.""

The spokesman said bridge required ""undoubted levels of mental skill"" and had ""known health benefits"".

The EBU does have some supporters in its corner, with the 2011 Charities Act saying sports are activities ""which promote health involving physical or mental skill or exertion"".

The World Bridge Federation records that in 1995 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) admitted the federation as part of the Olympic Movement, awarding it the status of a Recognised Sport Organisation. 

And the judge who decided there was a case to answer, Mr Justice Mostyn - himself a bridge player - was quoted in saying in his ruling: ""You are doing more physical activity playing bridge, with all that dealing and playing, than in rifle shooting.""",Is Bridge A Sport?

14379094-6996-4a3b-8eea-5d662e8a89eb,"How big is the refugee problem on Europe's borders? 

What is the EU actually for?A death notice for AylanHow you can help the refugeesBritain to take more refugeesMigrant crisis: full coverage

How big is the refugee problem on Europe's borders?

Big. Really big.

Robert Visser, director of the European Asylum Support Office, says conflict creates refugees, and there is more conflict near Europe's borders than there used to be. He points to Ukraine, the Middle East, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa.

""This produces people who go on the move and seek their future in Europe,"" he says.

The International Organisation for Migration estimates that more than 350,000 migrants were detected at the EU's borders between January and August this year. And there is potential for this number to keep climbing.

Violence and civil war in Syria and Iraq have displaced millions. An estimated 1.7 million refugees are in Turkey, 1.2 million in Lebanon, more than 600,000 in Jordan, hundreds of thousands in Iraq and Egypt. Another 7 million are internally displaced inside Syria. Roughly half of the country's entire pre-war population are refugees, at home or abroad.

On top of this, estimates of the numbers of people fleeing sub-Saharan Africa range up to another million – many of these end up in Libya or Tunisia, waiting to cross the Mediterranean.

How many are crossing into Europe?

The flow of asylum seekers into Europe is increasing.

According to Eurostat, 662,000 people applied for asylum in the EU in 2014. This was almost 200,000 more than the year before, and double the number in 2011.

The number is going to be even higher this year. Already it is about half a million, tracking 100-150,000 greater than the same time last year, an EU official told Fairfax Media.

Before June this year, between 60,000 and 70,000 new applications were coming in every month. In June the number suddenly shot up to 88,000.

Who are they?

In terms of origin, since 2012 by far the biggest national group has been those fleeing Syria. In 2014 Syrians made up 128,000 of the total asylum applicants – followed by 47,000 from Eritrea, 43,000 from Afghanistan, 38,000 from Kosovo, 31,000 from Serbia, then Pakistan, Iraq and Nigeria.

But the picture was different in 2010 – back then, the biggest group were Afghans, followed by Russians, Serbs and Iraqis.

Are they all allowed to stay?

Of course, not all asylum applications are approved. By Visser's estimate, up to a third of those seeking asylum in Europe do not qualify as refugees – at least by the standards that Europe applies.

There is political debate over those standards. Some say that migrants fleeing abject poverty, mandatory conscription or major civil unrest should be treated as refugees. Others say Europe is being too lenient, treating many as refugees who are really just seeking a better life in a better country, with better options for employment.

How do they get into Europe?

According to Frontex figures, in 2014 the majority of the refugees came over the central Mediterranean, on boats from Libya and Tunisia.

But this year the numbers coming by that route have almost halved – instead, there has been a huge surge in people coming over the eastern Mediterranean, at the land border between Greece and Turkey, or more usually over the sea. They make the short hop to islands such as Lesbos or Kos, where the arrival of so many unexpected asylum seekers has overwhelmed local authorities' ability to house, clothe, feed and process them. Many even travel by the regular passenger ferries: Greece claims that Turkish officials were making no attempt to stop them boarding.

Finally, there has also been a huge leap – more than doubling – in the numbers coming from or through the (non-EU) Balkan states such as Serbia, moving north to the borders with Austria and Hungary.

Where do they hope to go?

The short answer is, somewhere better.

Refugees themselves differ. I have spoken to some determined to reach Britain, others who say Britain is ""very bad"", citing its chequered history in the Middle East. Others talked of Canada, or Sweden.

Many want to go to Germany, because they know it is the most welcoming country, one where they stand the best chance of finding a community, starting a new life, getting a job, rather than ending up in a stagnant southern Europe economy or an eastern Europe camp in an unsympathetic, poor region. On Saturday, Austria said the asylum seekers would be granted entry, regardless of European Union rules.

Often, language is the determining factor. Those from Africa, especially, have English as a second language. They want education and employment, and ending up in an English-speaking country would make it easier to integrate faster.

How is the EU managing this?

The EU's ""Dublin"" regulations require that an asylum seeker is processed, their claim assessed, in the first country where they touch European soil.

After that, if their application is successful, they are resettled to countries that volunteer to take them.

This system is just not working.

The number of pending asylum applications rises every month. In September last year 434,000 people were in limbo, waiting to hear whether their application would be approved. By January it was 506,000. In June, the most recent month covered by Eurostat's figures, it was up to 568,000.

After processing only a handful of countries take almost all the refugees – Germany and Sweden welcome almost half, with France, Italy, Switzerland and Britain taking most of the rest.

This system operates in addition to the ""resettlement"" system: countries taking refugees directly from the camps on Syria's borders.

Countries (including Australia) take thousands each year under this scheme, with refugees assessed in terms of risk, urgency and medical need.

Why doesn't Europe just do what Australia did?

Indeed, some people are suggesting just that – UKIP's Nigel Farage, and Tony Abbott, for example.

There are two main reasons why it's more complicated for Europe.

Firstly, clearly, Europe is not an island. There are many overland routes to Europe – some refugees are even appearing in Scandinavia. Last week, a 31-year-old Syrian asylum seeker found refuge in Oslo after riding a bicycle across Russia's Arctic border with Norway.

Australia has, so far, not needed a ""turn back the bicycles"" policy.

Countless roads criss-cross the borders, and they're busy with modern commerce. It would take an extraordinary investment in infrastructure and personnel to close and secure the thousands of kilometres of Europe's land border.

Europe has tried artificial barriers, but Hungary's hastily-erected razor wire is failing to deter many. Wire can be cut. Tunnels can be dug.

A sea is a natural barrier. But the sea routes to Europe are much kinder than those to Australia. In the summer, the Mediterranean is often a bathtub dotted with cavorting dolphins. From the Greek island of Kos, the twinkling lights of Bodrum in Turkey are just a few hours' paddle in a dinghy away, for the determined. Obviously, the dangers are still there, especially as people smugglers and refugees resort to tiny, overloaded boats not fit for the voyage. But it must feel like a much less daunting option than the voyage to Christmas Island would. Turning back every boat on the wide Mediterranean would be a huge, massively expensive naval exercise.

Also, if a refugee has come via Libya, their boat would be turned back to a lawless, violent, near-failed state. It's no Indonesia.

What about public sentiment?

Even if it were practical to adopt a more ""brutal"" (in the words of the New York Times) refugee policy for Europe, there is neither the political nor public will. Europeans differ on the details (especially in the east) but many countries, especially influential Germany, feel a strong moral imperative to help those fleeing conflict at the first instance, rather than reject them unless they apply through the slow, congested official channels.

The shocking photo last week of the dead three-year-old Syrian boy on the Turkish beach has largely inspired compassion and a push to welcome more refugees, rather than to try to deter them from coming.

Where to from here?

Next week, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker​ is expected to unveil a plan for relocating 120,000 more refugees. But this is just a stopgap.

In the long term, the EU needs a continent-wide solution.

European states are bickering over how to spread the load more evenly. The aim is firstly to take some of the pressure off the countries where migrants arrive (such as Italy, Greece and Hungary), by sharing the processing duties on asylum applications.

Then, Germany and Sweden want a mandatory quota system for settling refugees, sharing them out over the continent.

Neither the refugees themselves, nor some of the countries more antipathetic to migrants, are happy with that idea.

So far, there doesn't seem to be a consensus. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",Everything you need to know about the European refugee crisis,News,Southern Highland News,2015-09-05T14:15:00Z
981c068c-bd27-45e4-b1e4-aead2c16870d,"In America, the go-to guy on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is Dr. Russell Barkley, whose impressive credentials include psychologist, clinical professor of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina and author of several books. In an online course about ADHD, Barkley compares my views on ADHD to those of the Church of Scientology. Rather than address the salient issues, he has consistently preferred ridicule and simplistic representations of my position on the subject. 

When I sought permission to use quotes from his papers, Barkley initially refused, implying that I might take him out of context. He eventually relented, allowing me and developmental/behavioral pediatrician Bose Ravenel to compare his position to ours in “The Diseasing of America’s Children.” To my knowledge, Barkley has never publicly addressed the issues we raise in the book. 

Barkley thinks ADHD is a disease, probably inherited, that affects brain chemistry and function. After nearly 10 years of research, Ravenel and I came to the conclusion that no good evidence exists to support Barkley’s disease hypothesis. Barkley is on record saying that although behavior therapy (behavior modification) can be a useful supplementary treatment, no approach to ADHD has ever or is probably ever going to completely replace pharmaceutical therapy. 

In this regard it is significant to note that Barkley has had ties to Eli Lilly and Co., the developer of the popular ADHD drug Strattera. In our book, Ravenel and I review the drawbacks of pharmaceutical therapy and lay out an alternative, research-based treatment plan involving a combination of strategic discipline, restricting electronic media and diet. 

The plain truth is that on numerous occasions we have seen ADHD symptoms completely disappear without medication. 

In 2012, the highly respected, peer-reviewed journal Pediatrics published a paper titled “The Diet Factor in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder” by two pediatricians — Gordon Millichap and Michelle Yee — who specialize in work with children who exhibit classic ADHD behaviors. What the authors found is that nutrition plays a significant role, for better or worse, in how a child’s brain works and that a proper diet (as opposed to the common refined-carbohydrate-saturated American childhood diet) helps children maintain focus and self-control and optimize academic performance. Their recommendations (as did ours) emphasize adding Omega-3 fatty acids and decreasing or completely eliminating processed foods, artificial colorings and preservatives. 
 
Millichap and Yee conclude that “Supplemental diet therapy is simple, relatively inexpensive and is more acceptable to patient and parent. Public education regarding a healthy diet pattern and lifestyle to prevent or control ADHD may have greater long-term success.” 

As Ravenel and I point out, a proper diet, as opposed to ADHD medications, has no side effects other than the positive “side effects” of improved mood, memory, focus, alertness and problem-solving. And it costs a whole lot less to boot.","John Rosemond: Is better nutrition, not drugs, the answer for ADHD?",News,Online La Crosse Tribune,2015-09-06T05:45:00Z

7ef3b9f0-9337-40d3-9c46-5cd85688743d,"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell is to set out plans for a ""new economics"" to redistribute wealth which will shift the burden of taxation away from low and middle earners. 
 
Conservatives accused Mr McDonnell of planning ""damaging tax rises on jobs, investment and earnings"", after he said his plans would ensure the economy ""serves everybody, not just the rich few"". 
 
A Labour government would force corporate ""tax dodgers"" to pay their share and there would be ""more wealth fairness and less welfare cuts"", he said. 
 
Mr McDonnell's first keynote speech since being appointed shadow chancellor comes as leader Jeremy Corbyn seeks to regain the initiative after activists denied him a vote at Labour's annual conference in Brighton on whether to keep the Trident nuclear deterrent. 
 
Mr Corbyn wants to scrap the missiles, but unions Unite and the GMB insist they should be kept and delegates decided on Sunday that the subject should not even be debated in the four-day conference. 
 
Meanwhile, The Times reported that a Unite official had proposed ""stuffing"" constituencies of centrist MPs who refused to serve under Mr Corbyn with supporters, in an apparent bid to force out moderates. 
 
In a leaked email obtained by the paper, executive council member Tony Woodhouse reportedly said the union should ""do a massive recruiting drive in the CLPs (constituency Labour parties) where MPs have said they wouldn't serve in his shadow cabinet"". 
 
But a Unite spokeswoman  said: ""As we have made consistently and regularly clear, Unite does not and will not support any moves to target MPs."" 
 
Writing in the Daily Mirror, Mr McDonnell said he wanted to launch a ""national debate"" about the future of the economy. 
 
""The way things have happened till now can't continue,"" he said. ""And we as a country need to decide if we think it's right for the poverty and inequality that exist to continue - or will we find a new fairer path."" 
   Promoted stories   
He said: ""As shadow chancellor, I make this solemn pledge: If elected in 2020, we will grow an economy which serves everybody, not just the rich few. 
 
""And we will pay for it not on the backs of the poor and the most vulnerable but from a fairer taxation system which lifts the burden away from middle and low-income earners and from collecting the tax lost every year to corporate tax dodgers. 
 
""The new economy under the next Labour government will be one in which we see more wealth fairness and less welfare cuts. 
 
""A new and fairer world is possible and together we can and will achieve it."" 
 
Aides said he would also unveil a ""radical"" review of the functioning of financial institutions including the Bank of England, though they said there was no question of stripping the bank of its independence. 
 
During his campaign for the Labour leadership, Mr Corbyn advocated a ""people's quantitative easing"" plan under which the bank would be given a new mandate to invest in housing, energy, transport and digital projects. 
 
A Conservative spokesman said Mr McDonnell's plans would mean tax rises on jobs, investment and earnings. 
 
""And as (Bank of England governor) Mark Carney has said, Labour's policy to end the Bank of England's independence and print money would drive up the cost of living,"" the spokesman said. 
 
""That's why Labour are a serious threat to our economic security and the security of all working people."" 
 
Speaking at a fringe event on Sunday night, Mr McDonnell said Labour would consider backing a ""Robin Hood"" tax on bank transactions to raise billions of pounds for public services. 
 
And he also promised ""a mass house-building programme"" and a system of rent controls to ensure the availability of affordable homes. 
 
The shadow chancellor's aides said his speech to the Brighton conference will not set out firm policies to be adopted by Labour, but indicate the direction in which the new leadership team under Mr Corbyn plans to take the party. 
 
He will set out four principles underpinning his approach: 
 
:: A Labour government would tackle the deficit by ""living within its means"", but would also invest to grow the economy, and share the proceeds of that growth more equally among different classes, regions and nations; 
 
:: A ""radical"" review will examine the role of a number of national institutions in building a stable economy; 
 
:: Labour will launch a national debate on a ""real economic alternative"" to the current arrangements; 
 
:: The party will bring together wealth creators, workers, businesses and civil society to promote a ""long-term sustainable economy"". 
 
On Sunday, Mr Corbyn used a TV appearance to hint at the possibility of an income tax cut for low earners while calling for firms to pay what they owe rather than hide profits in tax havens. 
 
He also restated plans to raise the top rate of income tax from 45% to 50%. 
   
 Share article  
   
McDonnnell aides said Labour would not necessarily adopt all the economic proposals set out by the Corbyn team during the leadership campaign, but said the ideas will ""influence"" the national debate in a series of meetings around the country.

The decision was made in the face of angry opposition from residents who argued parents dropping off their children would cause major traffic problems in the area, particularly on narrow Leopold Street.

But the debate also prompted scrutiny of the heavy use of on-street parking by residents.

Planning chair Ken Ong said South Yarra residents had an average of 2.2 parking permits per available property, while North Melbourne, Carlton and West Melbourne residents were automatically eligible to only one parking permit.

The Tuesday night meeting was told that in South Yarra (north of Toorak Road) there were 2000 residential parking permits, compared to just six car share spaces.

Councillor Stephen Mayne suggested part of the solution to parking congestion could be more people signing up to car-share schemes.

The comment prompted laughs from the crowd.

South Yarra resident Paul McSweeney replied that people in the area used trams and taxis as much as they could.

""You cannot take away people's right to have a car,"" he said. ""We do our best as good citizens not to drive but there's a limit.""

Another resident, Elizabeth Fox, suggested that many people's second permit was used for visitors and tradespeople, rather than for permanent parking.

People in the crowd later accused Cr Ong of threatening them when he said ""I think South Yarra is somewhat in a very good position [in relation to the parking permits] at the moment. Don't push us down the path — we'll do the same."" 

In response, someone in the audience called out ""that was a threat by any measure. It won't be forgotten"".

Cr Ong said ""all I am saying … is council had a policy over the years to reduce the number of permits in certain areas.""

Lord mayor Robert Doyle voted to approve the school's planning application but predicated that the stoush would land in Victoria's planning tribunal.

Two councillors voted against the permit. ""I have great concerns for the safety of kids and the elderly"" said Beverley Pinder-Mortimer, who lives in the area.

Resident Pauline Hirsh​ told the meeting Leopold Street had recently featured in Channel 7 reality police show ""The Force"", when a woman sideswiped​ six cars.

The school plan was originally opposed by council's engineering services department, who found there was not adequate parking planned to cater for dropping off and picking up students.

A reported submitted by the school's traffic engineers had suggested a number of measures — such as a staggered starting time for different groups of students — to deal with the parking issues.

But the council officers concluded there was ""little reassurance that any measures will be implemented"".

Engineering services eventually withdrew their objection after VicRoads approved a plan to provide five additional parking spaces on the south side of Toorak Road. Another 28 parking spaces will be built as part of an underground car park in front of the mansion.

Council officers said the development would provide a net benefit to the community, in a municipality that has been crying out for more schools.

The council received more than 100 objections to the project, which will see the demolition of a ""non-original"" rear part of the Victorian ""Italianate-style"" building.",South Yarra residential parking permits under fire,News,Melbourne Age,2015-09-02T05:57:23Z

  Is it possible that we’re in the midst of new trend in movies? Well, in 2010 there was “The Way,” in which Martin Sheen went on a 500-mile hike along Spain’s Camino de Santiago. Last year, Mia Wasikowska took a 1,700-mile hike through the deserts of West Australia in “Tracks” and Reese Witherspoon was Oscar nominated for tackling 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail in “Wild.” So, do three similarly themed films in such a short time span make for a trend? Nah, call it a coincidence. But wait a minute, here comes another one. OK, it’s official. With Robert Redford and Nick Nolte attempting “A Walk in the Woods” over the Appalachian Trail, stretching nearly 2,200 miles from Georgia to Maine, it’s a trend. Based on the 1998 memoir by travel writer Bill Bryson, this lighthearted tale of two guys who are probably too old to attempt such a feat is both picturesque and picaresque. The vistas are amazing and (most of) the stories are amusing. But fans of the popular Bryson book are going to have to get over a big hurdle. In the book, the two men were in their mid-40s. In the film, Bryson (Redford) and Stephen Katz (Nolte) are in their 70s. The age business that didn’t exist before is now one of the story’s major issues. “It’s just something I have to do,” says Bryson to his concerned wife, Catherine (Emma Thompson), who immediately says no, then softens it to, “You’re not doing it alone.” But everyone he calls responds with disinterest, until he’s surprised by a call from his old pal Katz, with whom he shared a European travel adventure 40 years earlier. And so we get a story of opposites. Bryson has led a full life, and has lots of accomplishments to his name. Katz is a rascal who may be on the run from the law for smalltime crimes. Bryson is internal; he doesn’t like talking to people. Katz is a loud, boisterous storyteller. Bryson’s got class. Katz is crass. Redford is given most of the script’s low-key verbal humor. Nolte gets the physical comedy. Both are on target with their delivery. Before long, they’re off to Georgia via plane in April and, packs on their backs, Katz is huffing and puffing on the first incline. Viewers would soon lose interest if this were just about these two fellows sharing small talk about the good old days all along the route, but colorful characters fill in the gaps. Hiker Mary Ellen (Kristen Schaal) joins them for a while, but is so annoying with her constant banter and urge to sing aloud that the ever-calm Bryson finally admits to the usually excitable Katz that he’d like to “rip her larynx out.” At a motel stop, they meet the overworked owner Jeannie (Mary Steenburgen), who appears to take a shining to Bryson, who would never even consider cheating on his wife. But like some sparklingly funny slapstick bits – Redford and Nolte meeting a bear, a bunk bed that collapses as it would in a Three Stooges short – the cameo appearances and the scenes built around them don’t go anywhere. They’re sloppily slapped into the film, played out, then forgotten. They take up space rather than move the film along. As April turns into May, and May turns into June, it’s back to the two guys on the trail, wending their way north. The script does provide some time for serious talk about the human condition, as seen through their own eyes. Something along the lines of “the universe is big and we’re small.” There’s even a little bit of non-perilous peril thrown in for good measure. So do Bryson and Katz accomplish what they believe will be a life-changing experience? It doesn’t really matter. The most important thing is that they went on a journey. Funny, I can’t recall how any of those other three long trek movies ended. I guess it didn’t matter there, either.",Movie review: Nolte and Redford's hiking film hits a few bumps on the trail,News,Taunton Gazette,2015-09-02T15:24:55Z

""It was as if the prisoner, awaiting the hangman's noose, had been led out to utter his final words. Despite the occasion, despite his funereal subject – multinational tax avoidance – he was sanguine and he spoke freely, as a man in his final hours mindful of his legacy.""

Senior editor at The Age, Mark Hawthorne, broke the story of the sale of Swisse - which grew from one little shop in suburban Melbourne in the 1970s into the country's biggest wellness company - to Hong Kong's Biostime for an astonishing $1.67 billion.

""The Swisse deal highlights the demand for Australian brands and products in China, which are regarded as ""clean and green"" when compared with domestic produce.""

If you eat M&Ms, you may want to avoid this story. Consumer affairs editor Esther Han revealed popular lollies, sauces and dressings have been found to contain nanotechnology that the national food regulator has long denied is being widely used in Australia's food supply.

""Friends of the Earth commissioned tests that found potentially harmful nanoparticles of titanium dioxide and silica in 14 popular products, including Mars' M&Ms, Woolworths white sauce and Praise salad dressing.""

Reporter Vanessa Desloires highlighted six reforms new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull could undertake that would move the sharemarket.

""We believe the reform agenda in Australia will accelerate under [Turnbull's] leadership, which should be positive for equities as an asset class,"" Credit Suisse research analyst Hasan Tevfik said.

Markets editor Jens Meyer reported on ANZ's call that the Aussie dollar may be heading to the 50s.

""Skittish investors have driven the Australian dollar lower but it could still fall further if a history of traders over-shooting the mark is any guide. ANZ sees the currency's trough at US67¢, but sees a downside risk to its prediction that could take the Aussie below US60¢.""

766fec01-f173-41e0-a567-283e50eaf4b3,"This summer, sophomore Anna Clemons spent a really long time trying to find an off-campus apartment. 

She visited different complexes with her dad, took notes and made neat lists of pros and cons. 

""They're really expensive here,"" she says. ""I don't know how they can afford that, but I can't."" 

Some of the places were more expensive than the dorms at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she's a student. But then she found one that made sense with her budget. 

The apartment is simple: fully carpeted, one bathroom and lots of beige. 

Most of the furniture in her big, well-lit room is from her childhood. But the dresser is from her mom's childhood, and that's where she keeps a list of everything she buys – down to the $2 shower curtains and the $548 she spent on textbooks. 

So, how much does she pay for this two-bedroom apartment that she splits with a roommate? 

$415, a month. 

In total, she saves at least a $1,000 a year by living off-campus. And if she keeps to her budget, she says she could save hundreds more by packing peanut butter sandwiches and making salads for dinner. 

The Cost of Eating and Living On Campus  

Over the last decade, room and board costs at four-year public universities have gone up roughly 25 percent above inflation. That's according to data from the College Board , which tracks college costs. 

""The bottom line is the cost of room and board at colleges have gone up far more than the cost of rooms in the private economy,"" says Richard Vedder, director of the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. 

The total cost of living and eating at UNC Chapel Hill is almost $11,000 a year. Compare that to the University of California, Berkley, where room and board cost more than tuition, at around $14,000. At The New School – a private school in New York City – it can be more than $20,000 if you live in a single room. 

College Board data shows that the average cost for room and board at a four-year public institution is $9,804. Average tuition is a bit lower at $9,139 (for in-state). 

Part of the reason why room and board charges are up is because electricity, water and employee salaries have gone up, says Allan Blattner, director of housing and residential education at UNC Chapel Hill. 
Universities also need money to make sure the buildings are in good shape, so students don't trip on broken stairwells or get stuck in elevators. 

""We have a building that was built in 1793 that is still an active residence hall,"" Blattner says. ""Obviously that takes some money to keep it moving."" 

Like a lot of schools, UNC requires that first-years live in a dorm to help build a sense of community and encourage them to do well academically. 

Still, every year there are some dorm vacancies, and this semester there are more than 700. So, Blattner and others got creative. They shuffled students around and are temporarily converting two dorm buildings into conference spaces. 
 
""We really wanted to turn lemonades into lemonade a bit and see if we can't turn that into a positive thing,"" he says. ""Anything that we can generate revenue on that isn't student rent is a real advantage to students."" 

Many students end up migrating off campus after their first or second year for a different pace and lifestyle. But the percentage of sophomores living on UNC's campus has gone down over the years from about 70 percent to 63 percent. 

Competition From Private Developers  

That decline has something to do with the growing number of properties off campus built just for students. 

""The student housing market has grown like a weed over the last 25 years,"" says Randy Shearin, editor of the magazine, Student Housing Business . 

Shearin says private developers are enticing students with flashy amenities and comforts they expect to see at home. 

Some of the luxury apartments target wealthier students, but, depending on the market, some of them can cost less or as much as dorms. 

""In the higher end student housing, you'll see everything from granite counter tops to resort-style swimming pools,"" Shearin says. ""I've seen pool tables in the living rooms. I've seen putting greens. I've seen batting cages."" 

But for some students like – Andrea Zuniga – all of those swanky features don't beat the convenience of living on campus, or the feeling of community. 

Zuniga, a UNC senior, decided with three of her best friends that they'd live in an apartment-style suite on campus. Unlike the dorms, it comes with a kitchen, two bathrooms and a spacious living room. 
 
The cost? About $800 a month, each. Zuniga says she could've lived in a nice off-campus apartment for $500. 

""I know I would've saved a whole bunch of money like all together,"" she says. ""But I just think my life has been a lot about money and budgeting."" 

The decision to live on campus was also easier because she's on a merit and needs-based scholarship that covers housing. Plus, she doesn't have to worry about the cost of a car or buying furniture. 
 
Zuniga says she enjoys being able to take a quick bus to the library, or walk to the cafeteria, or – on this night – take a Zumba class with her roommates.",Where To Live When You're A College Student,News,KNBA 90.3 FM,2015-09-15T17:23:00Z

Reports of a secret network of underground network deep beneath the city of Pueblo have long been dismissed as an urban legend. 

However the myth has been debunked after city officials confirmed they have discovered a 10 km stretch beneath the historic city centre. 

The secret warren, that measure seven metres high and three metres wide were found while the authorities were carrying out construction work. 

There were four separate entrances that had all been disguised and filled in with earth. 

Sergio Vergara Bermejo, manager of Cultural Heritage and Historical Center of Puebla, said: ‘In the urban narrative or urban legends there was word of the tunnels in Puebla, but nobody knew where they were, they had never been seen.’ 

The tunnels are believed to be between 300 and 500 years old. 

Sergio added: ‘They are from the foundation of the city 

‘Churches were communicating in secret alleys, there is a network of the main monasteries, from Santo Domingo, San Agustin, La Merced to San Javier.’

With two Victorian group 1 races already decided and another two to be run this weekend, spring is definitely in the air – and nothing suggests that more than speculation that Lloyd Williams has intensified his interest in this year's Melbourne Cup.

Williams, a four-time winner of the great race, has reportedly strengthened the already powerful troop by purchasing a share in three top-liners from the Coolmore operation in Ireland, all of whom are entered for the Cup.

They include English St Leger winner Bondi Beach, a rapidly improving three-year-old, and Kingfisher, a four-year-old who was a narrow and unlucky second in the 4000-metre Ascot Gold Cup at the Royal meeting in June.

Williams is also reported to have taken a share in Order Of St George, who triumphed in the Irish St Leger on September 13 by a massive 11 lengths.

Japanese challengers Fame Game and Hokko Brave arrived here on Saturday night and have gone into quarantine at Werribee. They will be joined soon by a group of raiders at present stabled at Newmarket in England.

""The 11 horses coming from Newmarket are halfway through their quarantine period,"" Greg Carpenter, the VRC's chief handicapper, said on Sunday. ""They will arrive in Melbourne next Saturday. They will also be joined by Super One, the star sprinting three-year-old from Singapore. That will be a total of 14 horses in the first batch of quarantine.

""The second round have to go into quarantine by next Saturday at the latest, and they will arrive in Melbourne by October 10.""

The likes of Coolmore, Godolphin, French trainer Antoine de Watrigant (who handles the Australian OTI Thoroughbreds-owned Gailo Chop) Peter Chapple-Hyam, English Derby winning trainers Michael Bell and Roger Charlton, jumps maestro Willie Mullins, multiple champion UK trainer Michael Stoute and perennial visitor Ed Dunlop are all set to have runners over the carnival.

""We are getting very strong indications from the Aidan O'Brien team that they will travel up to four horses, including Bondi Beach and could have runners in the Melbourne Cup, Cox Plate and another runner for feature races like the Mackinnon and the Emirates. The decision will be made during the week,"" Carpenter said.

""The two we are reasonably confident will travel for the Cup are Bondi Beach and Kingfisher. That decision has to be made by the end of the week.

""We are really positive about Godolphin and they may travel up to five horses. Sky Hunter [second on Saturday night in an Arc trial at Newbury] has got 54 in the Cup, while Secret Number has got 52.5 He won first-up for a year last weekend in a listed race at Chester. And they have two really talented horses down towards the minimum weight. One is Elhaame, and also Wadi Al Hattawi, who is a last-start winner.

""They understand that those horses are not guaranteed a run in the Cup, but they seem very keen to travel them and take their chance on winning a race like the Lexus if they don't get into the Cup, or running into the Sandown Classic at the end of the carnival.

""One of either Sky Hunter and Secret Number might go to the Lexus, the other to the McKinnon to try and get into the Cup.""

Carpenter said that, in addition to their Cups candidates, Coolmore is likely to bring at least one Cox Plate contender - Highland Reel.

""They look like bringing Highland Reel and Ol' Man River, or they might even bring a horse like Cougar Mountain [a sprinter-miler] for an Emirates. All those decisions have to be made this week and all those horses have to be in quarantine at the end of the coming week.

Sharper is one of 10 candidates eligible in their first year of Hall of Fame consideration. Players become eligible five years after they retire from playing, the nomination initially based on accomplishments on the field. 

When the first list of eligible players is submitted to voters, players with a significant number of trips to the Pro Bowl automatically are considered. Sharper was selected All-Pro six times and chosen for the Pro Bowl five times and also was named to the All-Decade team of the 2000s, making him an automatic candidate. 

Voting doesn't start until November when the list of 108 is shortened to 25. Voters are allowed to nominate others who are not on the list. 

The fact Sharper has pleaded guilty to sexual assault charges in four states does not change his eligibility. According to the voting bylaws, voters can consider activity on the field only in selecting or not selecting a player. The Hall of Fame does not remove the name of an enshrined player for any criminal activity, nor does it remove candidates for off-field behavior. 

It will be up to the 46 voters to determine whether Sharper moves to the list of 25 finalists.

Tensions remain high in Washington, D.C., as Democrats and Republicans continue to clash over several key issues, and the clock ticks away toward the start of the next fiscal year at midnight, September 30. 
 
While it's still unknown if the government will or won't shut down for the second time in less than two years, U.S. Travel Association economists revealed that a potential government shutdown would cost the U.S. Travel sector at least $185 million per day, as a result of temporary layoffs, reduced wages and fewer hours worked. 
 
The U.S. Travel projection encompasses the closure of national parks and historic sites—upon which many regional economies greatly depend—and also the cancellation of both government travel and private business travel related to government projects. 
 
""Political leaders need to understand that there are real-world consequences to these arguments that go on in the halls of power,"" said U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Roger Dow. ""I realize that each side feels passionately about their respective position, but frankly there's just no excuse for letting the fiscal year expire without a budget when we know that people's very livelihood, their ability to feed their families, is at stake."" 
 
U.S. Travel's measurement of a shutdown's impact on the travel sector does not account for any potential effect on other travel-related agencies, such as Customs and Border Protection, the Transportation Security Administration, or the visa-issuing organs of the State Department. 
 
""Though officials assured us at the time that the 2013 shutdown would not affect the work of those agencies, anecdotal evidence on that score was mixed,"" Dow said. ""If we detect that a new shutdown is hurting those travel-related functions as well, we'll certainly stand ready to spotlight the fallout for policymakers."" 
 
The 408 national park sites are spread across every U.S. state and territory in both rural and urban areas. Many regional economies are almost entirely dependent upon visitors to nearby national parks to support restaurants, lodging establishments and other businesses, and the jobs they provide. 
 
The shuttering of national parks due to the 16-day budget stalemate of October 2013 directly reduced travel spending by $680 million, U.S. Travel calculated, or nearly $43 million per day.",U.S. Travel Calculates Gov't Shutdown Cost,News,Meetings Focus,2015-09-22T23:33:11Z

e0466c10-ce8d-45e0-94ef-cb6ea312bfe1,"Long-time Santa Barbara County residents know how different our region is now, compared to what it was years ago. 

Some of the more significant changes are taking place in local agriculture. 

Specifically cattle ranching, which is being crowded out by development and other branches of agriculture such as the mushrooming wine-grape industry. 

It’s not just North County or the Central Coast. The gradual decline of cattle ranching is a statewide trend, and a cornucopia of factors are making cattle ranching less profitable than it once was. 

In a word, cattle ranching has morphed into a hassle, for many reasons. There is the fact that many Americans are eating more salad than steaks. Part of the decline can be blamed on an aging cattle rancher population. There are a litany of environmental regulations that cattle ranchers and every branch of the ag industry must contend with. Young farmers just don’t see the glamor of herding, feeding and caring for livestock. 

And then there’s the drought. Many farms barely have enough water for crops, let alone cattle. There are some ranchers who run cattle as a hobby and are definitely not in it for the money. 

Local cattle ranching peaked in the 1960s, and has been slipping downhill ever since. Those ranchers who are determined to stick with cattle tend to move their operations north of California — because this state and its drought have little to offer a serious cattle rancher unless they already own land here. 

And it has even less to offer locally, as vineyards, row crops and housing development take the land that once was prime for raising cattle. As one expert put it, this is a numbers game, and when it comes to cattle vs. wine grapes or strawberries, the numbers simply are not there for cattle ranchers. 

Cattle ranchers may get the feeling that fate and policy makers have it in for them. The fate part has to do with effects of this severe drought, which seems to be burning up a lot of potential grazing land. The policy element came into play recently when the state Water Resources Control Board created an oversight group to study restrictions on grazing cattle to protect water quality. Only a strong coalition of ranchers managed to quash that plan. 

It also must seem to ranchers that they have no allies in this fight for survival, and in a way that’s true. They have only themselves, and the belief that the cattle industry is an integral part of the Central Coast’s vibrant agriculture history. 

They should have another ally — the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors. That won’t be easy either. 

Board members — especially Peter Adam, Steve Lavagnino and Doreen Farr, who represent the bulk of ag land in the county — should take steps to protect the local cattle industry, and devise some measure of balance between cattle ranching and other branches of agriculture. 

We understand the importance of row crops, wine grapes and badly need housing developments, but we also believe the cattle industry could remain in a strong position locally — if the Board of Supervisors can come up with a plan. 

What about a program subsidizing the cost of expensive barbed wire fences? 

Santa Barbara County agencies do not maintain records showing the amount of unproductive ag land that could be used for grazing, but ranchers say that thousands of acres of pasture abut unfenced vineyards and row crops. 

If they could afford to fence it, ranchers would have a chance at leasing that land and putting it back into production. That’s an initial, realistic step, the county could take toward helping ranchers out while increasing productive ag land and saving a heritage the county was built on.  

Board members must first acknowledge the decline of cattle ranching, then put a good-faith effort into a long-range strategy to retain what’s left. 

Change is one thing, abandonment is something else.",Stepping up for ranchers,News,Adobe Press,2015-09-15T23:55:00Z
1432ce10-8672-4179-8cb8-4049712ed2a6,"The head of MI5 has warned that terrorist plotting against Britain is at its most intense for three decades and still growing as he backed new powers to monitor communications. 

Andrew Parker said new technologies were posing ever-greater challenges to his agency as he argued that internet firms such as Facebook and Twitter had a ""responsibility"" to share information. 

But he stressed that MI5 was not interested in ""browsing through the private lives"" of the general public and should work within a ""transparent"" legal framework. 

Giving the first live broadcast interview by any security service chief on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Parker played down fears about extremists entering Europe among the stream of refugees from Syria. 

He said the police and security services had intervened to foil six terrorist plots in the UK over the past 12 months and the threat was growing. 

""That is the highest number I can recall in my 32-year career, certainly the highest number since 9/11,"" he said. ""It represents a threat which is continuing to grow, largely because of the situation in Syria and how that affects our security."" 

Mr Parker said the ""shape"" of the threat was changing dramatically. 

""They are using secure apps and internet communication to try to broadcast their message and incite and direct terrorism amongst people who live here who are prepared to listen to their message,"" he said. 

The MI5 chief said the agency was focused on monitoring ""where terrorists may be and how they are moving"". 

He added: ""As far as the flow of migrants and refugees go, of course it is something we are aware of. It is not actually, as we speak today, the main focus of where the threat is coming from."" 

Mr Parker set out the challenges facing the security services as the Government prepares for a battle over legislation dubbed the ""snooper's charter"". The Investigatory Powers Bill would oblige UK internet service providers to keep data on their customers and make the information available to authorities. 

Mr Parker said: ""Because of that threat we face and the way the terrorists operate and the way we all live our lives today, it is necessary that if we are to find and stop the people who mean us harm, MI5 and others need to be able to navigate the internet to find terrorist communication. 

""We need to be able to use data sets so we can join the dots, to be able to find and stop the terrorists who mean us harm before they are able to bring the plots to fruition. We have been pretty successful at that over recent years, but it is becoming more difficult to do it as technology changes faster and faster."" 

He reassured people that MI5 was not interested in their private lives. 

""The important thing to say is that we focus on the people who mean us harm. We are not about browsing through the private lives of citizens of this country,"" Mr Parker said. 

""We do not have population-scale monitoring or anything like that."" 

Mr Parker insisted he did not ""have a view"" on specific measures such as whether ministers or judges should authorise interception of communications, insisting it was ""not for me to say what should or should not be in that Bill"". 

But he said it was important the law was updated so it was ""modern and transparent"" and ""describes as straightforwardly as it can what MI5 does these days"". 

Mr Parker insisted internet companies had a ""responsibility"" to come forward with information about potential threats. Even where the security services knew the identity of a suspect and had a warrant to obtain their communications signed by the Home Secretary, there was still a question of ""can we obtain those communications from that company?"". 

""It is in nobody's interests that terrorists should be able to plot and communicate out of the reach of any authorities with proper legal power,"" he said. 

Mr Parker also suggested there needed to be ""international agreement and arrangements whereby companies have a confident basis on which to co-operate with agencies like mine and with the police in order to protect society and their customers"". 

Asked about concerns that firms could be forced to share data with states like Russia and China, Mr Parker said: ""Britain stands for high standards in these things. We operate only under law, we have independent oversight and we have very, very strict principles of necessity - we only do what we really need to do; proportionality - we only do it at the scale that is absolutely necessary. 

""I think it is possible to think of international agreements based on those high standards and principles."" 

The MI5 head also referred to heavy criticism of Facebook over its failure to disclose a key conversation involving one of Fusilier Lee Rigby's killers. 

""In that case, the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) concluded that had that happened it might have made a material difference to the outcome,"" he said. 

""There is a real question here about responsibility for those who carry this information. 

""Some of the social media companies operate arrangements for their own purposes under their codes of practice, which cause them to close accounts sometimes because of what is carried. 

""I think there is then a question about why not come forward? If there is something that concerns terrorism, or child sex exploitation, or concerns some other appalling area of crime, why would the company not come forward? ""That was the question the ISC was raising."" 

Asked why the security services failed to prevent the killing of Fusilier Rigby or anticipate the actions of the extremist murderer known as Jihadi John, Mr Parker said officials had to make ""choices"". 

""There cannot be a guarantee that we can find and stop everything ... that would be impossible,"" he said. 

Mr Parker dismissed the idea that the way MI5 worked was radicalising people, or that its strategy was failing. 

""I don't think we are doing things wrong, I just think we need to keep on doing what we are doing and do more,"" he said. 

In a statement released after the interview, Mr Parker said that alongside the six plots thwarted in the UK, intelligence had disrupted a further nine attack plots overseas. 

He said MI5 had seen people ""radicalised to the point of violence within weeks"" by the internet.

But there is one critic who might be the most unnerving of all: the queen of England. 

Brian Hoey, author of  At Home with the Queen , told  People  one of the queen's favorite shows is ""Downton Abbey"" — just like us! 

Except when she watches it, she likes to find the historical inaccuracies —  not  just like us. 

Hoey also noted there's a  historical adviser  on the show, since it's based on the real-life family who lived at Highclere Castle. (Video via  CBS News ) 

That man is  Alastair Bruce . He watches for even the smallest inaccuracies, like an actor slouching in a scene. Slouching is considered a modern body posture, and Bruce says we slouch more than people would have in the early 20th century.

51820172-7016-4ab6-9328-e67883d15658,"Australia has scope to make more ambitious cuts to its carbon emissions after the initial targets are agreed at the Paris climate conference in December, Environment Minister Greg Hunt says. John Garnaut: China's gift to Turnbull Australia has scope to make more ambitious cuts to its carbon emissions after the initial targets are agreed at the Paris climate conference in December, Environment Minister Greg Hunt says. While the initial targets set by the Abbott government for a 26-28 per cent cut to 2005 emissions levels by 2030 remain, the government will consider enlarging the target in follow-up talks, he said.

""It's highly likely that the outcome from the Paris meeting will be a process for review of global and national targets, perhaps every five years, and that will prepare us for 2020, 2025 and 2030,"" Mr Hunt said in an interview with Fairfax Media.

""As we get to 2017 and 2018 and we see how we're travelling, we'll have the ability to progressively tighten targets and standards. The way we think of it is buying an option for the future.""

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said ""Paris is not the end of a process, it's a beginning"" as countries are expected to commit to regular reviews.

Mr Hunt's remarks will give hope to climate activists but fuel suspicion among the climate sceptics in the Turnbull government.

The comments came ahead of an expected announcement that China will commit to putting a national cap-and-trade carbon permit system in place by 2017. Some Chinese regions already operate such schemes.

It's not expected that this will alter China's overarching commitment for the Paris conference that it will start to cut total carbon emissions after 2030. Beijing has reserved the right to continue increasing emissions until that date.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said he will not consider an emissions trading system but remains committed to the existing policy of paying emitters to cut output: ""It doesn't matter how you cut emissions as long as they are cut and the Minister for Environment and this government is cutting emissions, our goal is reasonable, it's responsible and it's comparable to other countries similarly situated.""

This recalls the famous aphorism of China's Deng Xiaoping, who reshaped China from communism into a market based economy with the phrase that ""it doesn't matter if a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice"".

Mr Hunt said: ""People wrongly assume that an emissions trading scheme is the only market mechanism. But there's also an auction, or in our case a reverse auction mechanism, which is a market mechanism.""

He pointed out that Mr Turnbull had reorganised the Environment portfolio last week and it now includes the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, bodies the Abbott government had tried to abolish. The government failed when the Senate refused to co-operate.

Mr Hunt said: ""There's a change in mood in the renewable energy industry. What matters to them is that they know the RET [Renewable Energy Target] will stick.""

944c55ae-f361-4c9e-a9df-c5a77a1fe37d,"An appeal has been made to the Council of Legal Education, (CLE), to consider the law graduates of the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN), for admission into the Bar Part II of the Nigerian Law School. 
The appeal was made by the Abuja chapter President of the Law Students Association of Nigeria (LAWSAN) of NOUN, Mr. Moses Danladi Dairo, during the law week celebration of the body. 
Dairo equally appealed to the various stakeholders such as the National Assembly, Body of Benchers, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) as well as President Muhammadu Buhari, to intervene in the administrative conflict between the Council of Legal Education and the National Open University of Nigeria/National Universities Commission over the non-recognition of the NOUN law graduates for admission into the Bar Part II of the Nigerian Law School. 
He assured that the authorities of the CLE that the law graduates of NOUN would not constitute a preponderance of students of the Nigerian Law School, who would fail their Bar Part II final examination, if given the opportunity, stressing that the taste of the pudding was in the eating. 
The media should assist the LAWSAN of NOUN “to disseminate our plight and get the authorities to our side”. 
Dairo pointed out that the Open University Educational system had been embraced all over the world, as in the United Kingdom, India, China, South Africa, and Australia, stating that Nigeria cannot shut itself out and refuse to be dynamic, especially in this era of change. 
His words, “Nigeria should not remain an isolated island in this emerging global best practices, especially given the resolve that with the Vision 2020 policy drive, Nigeria is expected to eliminate all forms of illiteracy and provide education for all by the year 2020. 
“Law programme, certainly, should not be the prerogative of a few privileged”, he insisted. 
Dairo pointed out the NOUN was adjudged to be amongst the best universities in Nigeria offering law degree programme by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Mahmud Muhammad, when he spoke, recently, at a public lecture organised by NOUN at a lecture entitled: “Law as an Instrument of Excellence and Integrity”. 
The lecture, he said, was delivered by a legal luminary and former Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Senator Kanu G. Agabi, SAN, CON.

( NEWSER ) – At least 22 students were handed suspensions at Virginia's Christiansburg High School today for violating the dress code—but this was no case of exposed shoulders or short skirts. 
 
The students arrived at school wearing the Confederate flag on their clothes and refused to change to comply with school policy, which prohibits signs, decals, and articles of clothing ""that reflect adversely on people because of race, gender, or other factors,"" per the  AP . A Montgomery County Public Schools rep tells  WSLS  the students were given one-day in-school suspensions, but most became unruly and were then handed an out-of-school punishment instead.

8f1e1250-a421-40a9-980f-fd6c1c2bc81b,"Game Of Thrones has set a new record, winning 12 prizes at the 67th Emmy Awards. 
 
The show won eight awards at last week’s Creative Arts Emmy Awards, and then went on to scoop a further four at the star-studded ceremony held this morning at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles. 
 
Actor Peter Dinklage won outstanding supporting actor in a drama series and the show also picked up the prestigious outstanding drama series award.

He embraced co-star Lena Headey and told the packed crowd: “I was chewing gum, I wasn’t prepared because the other actors in my category awe me with their performances.” 
 
The show also won outstanding directing for a drama series (David Nutter, Mother’s Mercy) and outstanding writing for a drama series (David Benioff and DB Weiss).

It was an otherwise disappointing night for British TV talent, as shows like Downton Abbey walked away empty-handed. 
 
Despite being nominated for three awards, among them supporting actor and actress in a drama series, the night belonged instead to American shows, Veep and Olive Kitteridge. 
   Promoted stories   
Success was also sweet for How To Get Away With Murder’s Viola Davis and Mad Men star Jon Hamm. 
 
Viola made Emmy history by becoming the first black actress to win the outstanding lead actress in a drama series award.

She quoted 19th century African-American abolitionist Harriet Tubman, saying: “In my mind, I see a line. And over that line I see green fields and lovely flowers and beautiful white women with their arms stretched out to me over that line. 
 
“But I can’t seem to get there no how. I can’t seem to get over that line.” 
 [embedded content] 
She said: “The only thing that separates women of colour from anyone is opportunity. You cannot win Emmys for roles that are not there.” 
 
Jon finally scored the Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a drama series after seven previous nominations for the hit show and tripped over on his way up to the stage. 
 
Composing himself and collecting his Emmy from Tina Fey, he said: “There has been a terrible mistake clearly. It is impossible to named with all those extraordinary gentlemen, it’s impossible to be up here and to have done this show with these incredible people. 
 
“It’s incredible and impossible for me personally to be standing here so I want to thank the people I owe an incredible debt, families who have chosen for some reason to take me in and be nice to me. 
 
“Thank you to everybody who watched the show and thank you for this.” 
 
British writers Armando Iannucci, Simon Blackwell and Tony Roche were awarded outstanding writing for a comedy series for their script for the election night episode of the political comedy, Veep. 
 Armando Iannucci, center, and the cast and crew of “Veep” ( Phil McCarten/Invision) 
It was also named outstanding comedy series in the penultimate award of the night. 
 
Collecting the gong, creator Armando said: “If Veep is about one thing it’s about hope, hope that anyone in America, no matter their background, their race, their creed, can just miss out on getting the top job. Or they can get it if their boss is mentally incapacitated or killed. 
 
“So with that air of positivity, America has been so welcoming to the Brits on this show, thank you. 
 
The show also saw Tony Hale presented with the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series, while Julia Louis-Dreyfus poked fun at the American presidential race as she scored the outstanding lead actress in a comedy series award for her role as President Selina Meyer. 
 
Another big winner from the evening was Olive Kitteridge, which took home a host of awards, among them Bill Murray being named as best supporting actor in a limited series. 
 
Emmy winners Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Allison Janney arrived in the press room backstage holding hands, with Allison declaring: “We are going to throw down somewhere. We will play some cards.”

Armando, who left Veep after the end of the last season, told the Press Association that the Emmy win for outstanding comedy series had not made him reconsider his departure. 
 
Referencing Flavia Pennetta’s surprising win at the US Open just before she announced her retirement, he said: “Like Italian tennis players who bow out when they win the Open, I am pleased to pass it on. It feels like the right time, every show can benefit from new ideas.” 
 
He attributed the win to the higher stakes in the fourth season of the show: 
 
“We just get better with every season and now she’s President, everything she does has terrible international consequences and that made everyone raise their game.” 
 
Amy Schumer told the assembled press it was a rollercoaster moment when her win for best variety sketch series was announced.

Graham Mallinson,  a 72-year-old retired engineer from Newick in East Sussex, was watching the airshow from the A27 when  a vintage Hawker Hunter jet failed to pull out of a loop stunt and crashed onto the busy trunk road, exploding into a fireball and  killing 11 people. 
  Graham Mallinson, who has been named as the last victim of the Shoreham air disaster   
His family said in a statement:  ""He was the kindest and most generous man, who regularly gave his time to help others. 

			 
""Always loyal and reliable, he was a private and loving family man with a great sense of humour. 



 
""A very caring husband and father who was dearly loved, he will be very sorely missed by all his family and the wide circle of friends who had the good fortune to know him."" 

A life member and active volunteer of the Bluebell Railway in East Sussex, he had  recently developed an interest in photographing vintage aircraft and was at Shoreham to capture one of the last flights of the Vulcan bomber. 
  Floral tributes are left on a bridge near the A27 at Shoreham in West Sussex, close to the scene of the Shoreham air disaster   
His family said:  ""He was at the right place at the wrong time, doing what he loved best on a beautiful summer's day."" 

The tribute was released as the  inquest into the deaths of the victims was opened  at County Hall North in Horsham, West Sussex. 

			 
All the victims' names were officially confirmed before a minute's silence was held during the hearing. 

Some families of those who died on August 22 attended the opening of the inquiry by West Sussex senior coroner Penelope Schofield. 

As inquiries continue by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Ms Schofield adjourned the inquest to a date to be fixed. 

The coroner said: ""I will conduct and full and fearless inquiry as the law requires but as you can imagine this will take time for the various agencies to report to me."" 

			 
She added: ""Many people have been affected by the tragic events in August 22 2015 and my thoughts are primarily with the families."" 

A pre-inquest review will be held on March 22 and Ms Schofield  said she would provisionally set the full inquest into all the deaths next June, ahead of the first anniversary of the disaster.

14ce0aa7-7a27-4739-bb27-6ab6fbe462bc,"SDLP West Tyrone MLA and Vice Chair of the Stormont Agriculture Committee Joe Byrne has repeated his call for specific EU backed intervention to support dairy farmers amid the ongoing farmgate price crisis. 

		 
Mr Byrne said: “Dairy farmers across the North are in a dire situation and exceptional measures are needed to relieve the extreme pressures that many are currently operating under. 

“This situation has continued for too long and it’s important that we see urgent action from DARD Minister Michelle O’Neill. Farmers cannot operate their farm businesses getting less than 19 pence per litre for milk. 

			 
“Immediate consideration must be given to enhanced aid and support for private storage of the current surplus of dairy products – cheese, butter and skimmed milk products. This would remove some surplus product and help create market stability. 



 
“We also need harmonised legislation across the European Union to ensure fairness in farmgate prices. Any such legislation must be based on ensuring that primary producers get a reasonable price that covers, at least, industry production costs. 

“The Agriculture Minister must work with her counterpart in Britain to create short term aid and supply payments that can address industry wide cash flow problems faced by primary producers. That must go hand in hand with an early release of a larger slice of Single Farm Payments/basic payments and at least 70% up front payments.” 

SDLP Leader Dr Alasdair McDonnell MP added: “The SDLP will continue to press the Minister and the EU commission on these issues. We need a resolution to this crisis as soon as possible to sustain our farming industry and rural communities. Any further delays will mean some farmers going out of business.”",Byrne calls for urgent EU intervention to support dairy farmers,News,Farming Life,2015-09-01T14:30:49Z
2163a350-525d-4ff8-bb1d-442882d17ead,"Germany assumed top spot in their European Championship qualifying group at Poland’s expense on Friday.

In Group D, Germany’s FIFa World Cup hero Mario Goetze scored twice to help his side to a 3-1 win over previously unbeaten Poland in Frankfurt, Germany.

Thomas Mueller opened the scoring in the 12th minute, assisted by Cologne defender Jonas Hector, who also set up Goetze seven minutes later.

Poland captain Robert Lewandowski pulled one back with a thumping header to Kamil Grosicki’s brilliant cross, but Goetze sealed the win on the rebound in the 82nd minute after Lukasz Fabianski saved Mueller’s initial effort.

Germany and Poland remain the favorites for the two automatic qualifying places from the group, leaving Ireland and Scotland to scrap it out for third place.

The best third-placed team qualifies directly, while the other eight third-place finishers can qualify through playoffs.

Ireland took advantage of Scotland’s 1-0 loss in Georgia by beating Gibraltar 4-0 in Portugal to move third, two points behind Poland.

Valeri Kazaishvili’s 38th-minute strike was enough for Georgia to claim their second group win and deal a blow to Scotland’s hopes of qualifying.

Against Gibraltar, Ireland’s Cyrus Christie opened the scoring with a fine individual effort in the first half, Robbie Keane made it 2-0 four minutes after the break and the Los Angeles Galaxy forward converted a penalty two minutes after that. Substitute Shane Long wrapped it up in the 79th minute.

Germany lead with 16 points — two ahead of Poland — with three rounds of games remaining.

Northern Ireland took the lead in Group F with a 3-1 win in the Faeroe Islands, while Hungary and Romania stayed scoreless in a game marred by fan violence.

Police used tear gas and a water cannon on fans as ambulances took away the injured. Fans threw rocks and garbage at police, who said at least 13 people were detained.

Gareth McAuley scored twice and Kyle Lafferty got the other for Northern Ireland against the Faeroe Islands in the capital, Torshavn. Joan Edmundsson claimed the Faeroes Islands’ only goal, but picked up a second yellow card as the home side played the final 25 minutes with 10 men.

Finland subjected Greece to their fourth loss from four home games, with Joel Pohjanpalo scoring for a 1-0 win.

Northern Ireland lead with 16 points, one in front of Romania and four ahead of Hungary.

Denmark drew 0-0 with Albania, while Serbia beat Armenia 2-0 at home for their first group victory.

Serbia took the lead in the 22nd minute when Filip Kostic delivered a cross to the back post where Andrija Zivkovic put the ball toward the line with Armenia defender Levon Hayrapetyan getting the final touch for an own-goal. Adem Ljajic capitalized on a rebound to claim the second goal shortly after the break.

Neither Serbia nor Armenia can qualify.

In Copenhagen, the visitors surprised Denmark by being much more offensive than expected.

Sokol Cikalleshi’s header in the 23rd minute forced Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel into action.

Denmark dominated the second half with attempts from Nicolai Jorgensen, Nicklas Bendtner and Daniel Agger. Bendtner had a goal ruled out for offside.

InsiteCommerce 4 appeals to such users as distributor Geriatric Medical. 
    
Insite Software Inc. released new e-commerce software today designed to help its core customers—midsize to large manufacturers and distributors—handle complex transactions and scale up online to handle increasing sales. 
 
A typical customer,  Geriatric Medical & Surgical Supply  Inc., distributes products ranging from symbiotic chewable tablets and wound care dressings to blood glucose monitoring systems and mattress replacement systems to health care facilities that care for elderly residents. Geriatric Medical has already found that customers who order online spend an average of 25% more per order compared with when they buy offline; they also purchase 60% more product lines per order online than offline, the company says. 
 
Going forward, the distributor needed a more flexible and scalable e-commerce software platform to maintain its ability to present and sell high volumes of diversified products,  Geriatric Medical CEO Jeffrey Siegal  says. “In today's highly competitive marketplace, it is vital for us to stay one step ahead of the competition by having the infrastructure in place to enable our customers to quickly access detailed information on our latest product offerings,"" he says. ""InsiteCommerce 4 is engineered for growth, built with the technology in place enabling us to upgrade quickly to facilitate faster speed to market and better serve our customers."" 
 
Insite Software  has close to 200 clients, including distributors American Paper & Twine Co., Consumers Interstate Corp. and Borders States Electric, and manufacturers  Thule Inc. ,  Great Northern Corp.  and  Jet Edge Inc. 
 
Tony Abena, CEO of Insite , says the newest version of InsiteCommerce was designed as both an “out-of-the-box” e-commerce application that can be deployed without customization work, and an e-commerce platform that companies with extensive I.T. resources can customize to meet highly specialized ways of selling products online and interacting with customers. For example, InsiteCommerce4 is designed with RESTful web services, a technology used to build customized applications, or widgets, that can add features and functionality like product configurators that integrate with a content management system. (RESTful stands for representational state transfer, a technology architecture designed for building web services applications.)

Thousands of festival-goers were left stranded overnight without shelter, food or water, after poor planning and bad weather conditions turned a music festival into a weekend from hell. 
 
Festivalgoers were unable to leave the TomorrowWorld venue, a massive three-day electronic dance music festival in the US, on Saturday night as organisers would not allow Ubers, taxis and other transportation near the pick up area. Shuttles and buses already at the venue got stuck in the mud, frustrating non-campers even further. 
 
Revellers were left stranded in the cold and rain for hours. Many walked over 15 kilometres to find a way out of the forest where the event was held, but hundreds eventually gave up and went to sleep on the grass 
 
""We saw people peppered on the sides of the road who had given up from exhaustion,""  
 
she and her friends waited in line for a shuttle for over two hours, and were then told by organisers to walk several kilometres to another checkpoint for buses. ""It was unfair for them to tell us to 'keep walking, there are shuttles a few miles down the road' when they already knew all of them had been cancelled,"" she said. 
 
Organisers say TomorrowWorld will offer refunds for Sunday's ticketholders after bad weather made the event inaccessible to them on the final day. Officials said that the tickets will be refunded entirely and automatically, including service, shipping and payment fees. 
 
The festival was only accessible to visitors in the DreamVille onsite camping area after rainfall in the past few days hampered festival parking fields, drop-off locations and the shuttle system. 
 
A statement on the website said: ""First of all we would like to sincerely apologise for the inconveniences due to the weather conditions and to all who couldn't be part of the 3rd day of TomorrowWorld 2015. Continuous and unexpected rainfall over the last three days has severely limited capacity of the parking lots, entrance roads, and drop off locations in and around the festival site, and has led to severe traffic congestion. The experience and safety of the TomorrowWorld visitors is and always was our top priority."" 
 
Sunday was the finale of the three-day festival in Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia, US. 
 
Single-day tickets cost USD$145 (NZ$228), according to TomorrowWorld's website. The festival was expected to draw 190,000 people.

Back in 1971, German rockers Scorpions butted heads with their then-producer Conny Plank about song publishing. 
  
He wanted them to sign to his publishing companies, but the group wanted to work with a more international concern. “I said, ‘We want to play all over the world. We want to play in America,’” guitarist Rudolf Schenker, 67, recalls by phone from Hanover. “And (Plank) was laughing like crazy.” 
  
Adds Klaus Meine, 57, “He said, ‘Keep on dreaming. There’s no chance.’ There was no German band before who became successful in the United States. This is a very unique story at the end of the day.” 
  
Schenker, Meine and their compatriots had the last laugh, of course. Scorpions — which Schenker formed 50 years ago in Hanover — indeed went on to make it big in the U.S. and around the globe. It’s sold an estimated more than 10 million albums in the U.S. alone and worldwide has notched more than 200 gold and platinum certifications. “The Zoo,” “Rock You Like a Hurricane” (No. 18 on VH1’s list of 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs) “Still Loving You” and the socio-political anthem “Wind of Change” are enduring rock radio (and Guitar Hero/Rock Band) hits, and the group has won three World Music Awards and received a star on the Hollywood Rock Walk. 
 
 
  
So the group feels a sense of redemption for this year’s 50th anniversary celebration — accompanied by a new album, “Return To Forever” — even if Scorpions voice slightly ambivalent feelings about hitting the mark. 
  
“Fifty years — it sounds so damn old!” Meine, who joined Scorpions during 1969, says with a laugh. “But then you join this exclusive club, bands like the Stones, the Who, the Beach Boys, still around and still doing great. All the highs and lows, we’ve weathered the storms. Like in the (new) song, ‘We Built This House,’ we built this house on rock ’n’ roll — and it still stands.” 
  
What makes this year also sweet is that Scorpions conducted a Final Sting farewell tour during 2011-2012. But the reception for that and for 2013’s “MTV Unplugged — Live in Athens” album convinced the group to reconsider its self-imposed demise. 
  
“We thought we’d stop on a high note, but it went so well it was so successful and it seemed like people wanted more Scorpions,” Schenker explains. “We thought, ‘They still want us. We still love doing this. Let’s keep going.’”","Sound Check: 50th anniversary makes Scorpions feel ""old,"" accomplished",News,Oakland Press,2015-09-23T16:14:00Z

The slowdown of Chinese growth has “probably more spillover effects in the region in particular than what was anticipated,” Christine Lagarde said in a speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.

According to Lagarde, the Chinese cooling has “downside risks… greater than they were estimated.”

“Growth is lower,” she said, referring to the global economy.

China’s slowdown, and questions about the government’s ability to manage it, have spurred concerns about the health of the world’s second-largest economy that have rattled financial markets in recent months.

Lagarde noted the easing Chinese growth had already helped push commodity prices lower, putting pressure on export-led economies and their public finances.

Her remarks came as Chinese President Xi Jinping began his first state visit to the United States in the West Coast technology and aviation hub of Seattle Tuesday, aiming to woo US businesses. President Barack Obama will host Xi for talks at the White House on Friday.

Everyone has their own pre-game routine, and that's no different for the Republican presidential hopefuls squaring off at Wednesday's CNN debate. 
 
For Sen. Rand Paul on this debate day, that means going shooting --- shooting the tax code, to be exact. 

""I will be out shooting target practice in the morning,"" Paul said on CNN's ""The Lead"" Tuesday. ""I will be shooting the tax code with some friends tomorrow morning, and that will be my preparation."" 

It's not too far of a stretch for the Republican presidential candidate from Kentucky; in July he chopped up the tax code with a chain saw to promote his tax plan. 

But it definitely stands out as a debate warm-up ahead of CNN's showdown Wednesday night at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley. 

Some of his rivals are taking a quieter approach. 

Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina will play solitaire to stay relaxed and focused before having lunch with her husband, Frank, according to her campaign. 

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is going to church with his wife, Columba, while Ohio Gov. John Kasich plans to fit in some policy discussions with advisers as well as a workout (we hear he likes the elliptical machine and lifting weights). 

Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania may browse through the Reagan library again like he did before he was on the debate stage in the last presidential election. He'll also do some more policy prep, but ""he keeps it pretty low key on debate day,"" said spokesman Matt Beynon. 

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is planning to hit the gym as well as dine on a lunchtime meal of slices of pizza and a Diet Coke. 

Santorum and Jindal will both be featured in the 6 p.m. debate, before the prime-time one.

e8dde9b5-e973-40bd-8247-187bd9ace565,"(ShareCast News) - The FTSE 100 was dragged lower by a slump in mining stocks following weak Chinese data and broadly bearish sentiment in the commodities market.

Glencore and Anglo American were the top fallers after Investec said the challenging environment for the sector calls into question the equity value of the mining companies. The note from the brokerage came as Glencore agreed to sell its Araguaia nickel project to Horizonte Minerals for a discount price of $8m.

Other miners, including BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, also declined as commodity prices dropped and a report showed an 8.8% decrease in Chinese industrial profits in August, adding to concerns about the nation's slowdown.

""None of the major mining companies could avoid the chaos of the panic selling, and it will be a long time before confidence is restored,"" said IG's market analyst David Madden.

Elsewhere in Asia, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said inflation would not reach 2% without further improvement in wages, employment and prices.

In European news, pro-independence parties in Spain's Catalonia region won an absolute majority in regional elections but they fell just short of getting 50% of the vote, winning 1.9m out of 4m ballots cast. Spain's central government in Madrid said it would challenge the move towards independence but the pro-independence parties are expected to form a coalition.

US data, interest rates

Personal spending in the US rose 0.4% in August from a month earlier, the Commerce Department revealed, beating forecast of 0.3% growth. Personal incomes climbed 0.3% in August, worse than the 0.4% rise expected.

""Admittedly, the more modest 0.3% month-on-month increase in personal income last month is a little discouraging at first glance,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.

""But there are few signs of weakness linked to the labour market. Wages and salaries increased by a strong 0.5% month-on-month in August, following an even bigger 0.6% month-on-month rise in July.""

Another report showed US pending home sales fell unexpectedly last month to reach their lowest-level in five months. The index from the National Association of Realtors decreased 1.4% month-on-month in August to 109.4 compared with analysts' expectations for a 0.4% gain and with a 0.5% increase in the previous month.

Meanwhile, Federal Reserve official William Dudley said the central bank will ""probably"" raise interest rates later this year. Speaking at an event in New York hosted by The Wall Street Journal the president of the New York Fed said, ""I think that the economy is doing pretty well"", although his expectation was for growth in the second half to be ""a little bit weaker"" than the first half.

His remarks mirrored that of Fed Chair Janet Yellen's last week when she said a rate hike was expected this year unless the global economic outlook worsened.

Companies

SABMiller jumped following a Sunday Times report that Anheuser-Busch InBev SA could bid about $106bn for the company much sooner than originally anticipated. Talks between the two brewing giants are said to have been warming up and carried on over the weekend.

Vodafone dropped after ending talks with Liberty Global about a merger of the European businesses.

BAE Systems gained after Bernstein upgraded the stock 'outperform' from 'market perform', with an unchanged price target price of 545p.

Ultra Electronics rallied after JP Morgan Cazenove upgraded the stock to 'overweight' from 'neutral'.

Home Retail Group advanced after Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded the company to 'buy' from 'hold'.

That's how long it took for all 10,000 tickets to watch Pope Francis celebrate Mass later this month in Philadelphia to be taken, an apparent indicator of the excitement over his first visit as pontiff to the United States. 

The tickets were made available online at 8 p.m. on a first-come, first-serve basis, according to those behind the World Meeting of Families, the event that is a chief focus of the Pope's visit and is affiliated with the Philadelphia archdiocese. And people couldn't pick up more than four tickets at a time. 

Even with that restriction, the tickets to the 4 p.m. Mass on Sunday, September 27, at Eakins Oval along Benjamin Franklin Parkway were gone within 30 seconds, the same organization said. 

These tickets were free. That didn't stop people from trying to take advantage. Within two hours of when they went on sale, eBay already had a host of people hawking individual tickets for from $99.99 up to $450. 

Such blatant capitalism appears at odds with the Pope's railings the ""unfettered pursuit"" of money,"" which he called ""the devil's dung"" while touring South America in July. 

But it's not the only example surrounding the Pope's much hyped American tour. 

Several hundred people this month took to eBay and Craigslist trying to sell train tickets for the Pope's visit to Philadelphia for up to $40, or four times their face value. 

And Airbnb is buzzing with people offering their homes for Francis' visit, including one for a 2-bedroom condo for $7,000 a night.",Pope Mass tickets gone in 30 seconds,News,WTAE.com,2015-09-10T17:12:53Z

As organizations increasingly turn to the cloud to support their strategic business goals, Brazil's cloud computing market is expected to more than double in the next two years. According to research firm Frost & Sullivan, Brazil's cloud computing market, worth $474.8 million in 2014, is estimated to reach $1.11 billion in 2017. While cost reduction remains a major driver for cloud adoption, 45 percent of Brazilian IT executives responding to a 2014 Frost & Sullivan survey said the cloud supports business innovation, and another 45 percent said the cloud provides greater flexibility for their organization to explore new business opportunities. 

By providing Brazilian customers with a local onramp to IBM Cloud resources, IBM increases flexibility for storing and computing data within the country. The new data center joins two other IBM Cloud data centers in Latin America: one located in Hortolândia, São Paulo and Queretaro, México, along with an expansive network of data centers that blanket the globe, providing users with the performance and disaster recovery solutions needed to ensure business continuity in case of accidents. 

All IBM's commitment to the development of Cloud in the market is paying off. Seekr, a Brazilian startup, launched in 2010 and one of the largest social media monitoring companies in the country, moved to SoftLayer recently. ""It is apparent to us, partners, the investment and interest from IBM to evolve increasingly SoftLayer. More than performance and quality, one of the great advantages of IBM is the service, promptness and assistance in defining the best solution for our needs, extremely difficult to find in other solutions of Cloud Computing,"" says Mauricio Brentano, CTO of Seekr. 

From the new location, the connections with IBM Cloud services in Latin America will be reduced to just milliseconds. The new data center can also host OpenStack-based solutions including those from Blue Box, a recent IBM acquisition. This helps extend the reach of any OpenStack environment, enabling customers to connect to infrastructure and managed services that support powerful architectures including AIX on Power Systems. This results in more flexibility and choice for customers when it comes to open standards and hybrid cloud deployments. 

IBM operates more than 41 cloud data centers in the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe so that customers can provision cloud resources exactly where and when they need them. Users have granular visibility into data center locations -- down the exact city -- allowing them to deploy critical cloud workloads in targeted geographic locations in order to minimize network latency, improve application performance and comply with local data regulations. 

IBM has more than doubled Softlayer's overall data center capacity since it invested $1.2 billion back in 2014 for a massive global datacenter expansion. Now, this globally integrated network of cloud data centers, on every major continent, provides enterprises with the ability to scale and build out their IT resources as needed while minimizing risk. When coupled with Bluemix, IBM's PaaS offering, developers can easily create and test new applications in full production environments from anywhere in the world while also having access to in-house resources like Watson for cognitive computing services as well as to dozens of third party services. 

Customers can order servers and services in the newly launched São Paulo data center by visiting www.softlayer.com/info/sao-paulo-hosting or contacting IBM Brazil.

Eamonn Holmes has revealed he had a face-off with Rihanna's bodyguard on the set of ITV's This Morning prior to her interview on the show. Speaking to Ryan Tubridy on 2fm about the best and worst of his celebrity interviews, he branded Rihanna a ""nightmare"".

""I walked out to speak to her - I'm a believer in speaking to them in the waiting room before they begin - so I went out and said 'Hello Rihanna, my name is Eamonn and I'll be doing the interview' and I got a thump on my arm, a thump on my arm!"" he revealed.

""I looked around and there's this big burly guy standing beside her and he said, 'Hey, you want to talk to Miss Rihanna you do it through me' and he points to his eyes as in 'look at me'. I said, I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry I didn't realise you were on the programme.'""

When the bodyguard said he was not on the progamme, Holmes reveals he replied with, ""Exactly, she is, so I'm going to talk to her and if you touch my - and I used a lot of expletives - arm once more I will break your arm and stick it up your ass.""

Despite the war of words Rihanna did appear on the show although Eamonn said came out ""with a blanket around her, two people practically carrying her in a sedan chair, out into the studio"".

Holmes had another difficult interview recently with David Cassidy, who spoke to the presenter and his wife and co-host Ruth Langsford via video link from his home in Florida but appeared to be irked by the most innocuous of questions.

Holmes revealed Cassidy was ""paid a lot of money"" for the ""friendly tribute interview"" but when he shouted at Ruth ""that really quite annoyed"" the Belfast-born presenter. Read more: ""There are people who have attitude right from the start,"" he said, ""Like that Tarantino interview with Krishnan Guru Murthy - you could tell [Tarantino] had attitude right from the start. 

""And someone like De Niro [who recently walked out of an interview] walks around with a chip on his shoulder,"" he added, ""I have no desire ever to put myself through a De Niro interview, or a Russell Crowe interview. I've never met Russell Crowe but you know what? I don't want to.""

Tubridy assured Holmes that Crowe had been ""convivial and good company and good craic"" during his Late Late Show appearance earlier this year but Holmes was not convinced. Read more: Holmes also recommended that Ryan Tubridy refuse to interview Meg Ryan should the opportunity ever arise.

""I did her before Parky,"" he said, ""Nobody believes me. Everybody would say, 'Aw but she's Sleepless in Seattle, she's When Harry Met Sally, she's sweetness, she's lovely.

""She's the world's worst example maybe of actors who see themselves as empty vessels. When they're given a role they are somebody and they can talk but they're not comfortable or can't talk about themselves.

""She's painfully, painfully aware of herself and really, just honestly, don't ever bother. Don't go there if you're offered.""

Holmes said he believes the availability of alcohol on Irish chat shows helps celebrities to ""loosen up"".

""So many people are buttoned up and particularly with Americans, people who take themselves very seriously, if they're at the top of the tree they're usually alright,"" he added. ""If they're on the way up they're surrounded by advisors, people who say 'Stop this interview!'""

He said that one particular ""bland American actress"" caused ructions in studio.

""I remember one of them, she was just about to marry Justin Timberlake - Jessica Biel - so we said during the interview, 'And, wedding plans?' and her PR jumped into the studio and said, 'Stop this interview!'. In a live studio she jumps in!"" he said.

Anyone who watched even part of Juncker's confused and rambling address to the European parliament yesterday will have little doubt that Europe's most senior unelected official is worried. Juncker and his fellow unelected officials may be settled on a plan for migrants, but they haven't counted on the people of Europe. Those pictured by the BBC  with garlands and greetings are in a numerical minority everywhere in Europe except Sweden. Germany even has a lower percentage of voters in favour of migrants than the UK. Yet again Europe's anti-democratic bosses are defying their own people – but this time it may all turn sour. 

Juncker is also attempting a further power-grab for the unelected bureaucrats of Brussels, over-riding national governments to allocate migrants with no right of veto or objection by states except through QM in the Council. Germany is making noises about reducing the cash that ends up in Eastern Europe if they don't play ball. 

Yet as AEP points out, the EU is now fractured both N-S and E-W. Greece has yet to leave the Euro, France is set to elect Marine Le Pen, Polish voters are looking to Hungary as they choose a new government in October, opinion in the UK is changing daily and across the continent 500m people are becoming ever more disillusioned with the anti-democratic cabal in Brussels.

The insurer has revealed that a device containing their names, addresses, sort codes and bank account numbers went missing from one of its data centres on July 30. 
 
RSA has stressed that there is currently ""no evidence to suggest the data has been misused in any way"" and apologised for the incident. 
 
The insurer said the device was reported as stolen to the police, although it declined to say when this had happened. 
 
However, affected customers were only informed of the situation last week after the RSA sent out letters, more than a month after the device went missing. 
 
Lloyds has confirmed it was informed of the missing device on July 30, and said it was supporting RSA's investigation. 
 
RSA said is offering affected customers two years' access to Cifas identity protection. 
 
However, because the insurer cannot take the protection out on their behalf, customers will have to apply themselves and pay the £20 fee, then request a refund from RSA.

d7c3022a-e110-49c4-8d0b-ef8feab9a96d,"HIRSCHFELD, GERMANY (Reuters) - Scientists in Germany have come up with a method for extracting the precious element germanium from plants. 
 
The element is a semi-conductor and was used to develop the first transistor because it is able to transport electrical charges extremely quickly. Nowadays, silicon-germanium alloy is indispensable to modern life, crucial in making computers, smartphones and fiber-optic cables. 
 
Transparent in infra-red light, germanium is also used in intelligent steering systems and parking sensors for vehicles. 
 
Yet although germanium is present in soil all over the world, it is difficult to extract, and most supplies currently come from China. Now scientists at Freiburg University of Mining and Technology think they have found a revolutionary way to obtain it from their own soil - with a little help from the natural world. 
 
Biology professor Hermann Heilmeier is one of the scientists using common plants for this uncommon process. 
 
""What is being cultivated in this field are various energy crops -- for example sunflowers, corn, reed canary grass - but instead of using them for energy purposes we want to use them for phytomining. In German we call it 'mining with plants'. We want to bring elements that are present in the soil into the roots and shoots of the plants, harvest them and then extract these elements from the plants after they have been used for energy, that is to say fermented,"" he said, showing off his field of crops as he measured the moisture levels of the soil. 
 
The process is still in its early stages, but Heilmeier says they have now identified the plants that could allow them to scale the attempt up. The next stage of the process takes place in a laboratory at the university in Freiburg, where head of industrial chemistry Professor Martin Bertau has been overseeing the project. He said the region is very well-suited to the extraction of germanium due to the composition of the soil. 
 
""There is zinc ore present here, the ground is very rich in zinc. We have the remains of waste rock piles from mining, which germanium-rich water can drain better through. And when you cultivate plants here and give them that water, they can build up germanium reserves through normal physiological processes. We unlock these reserves through fermentation with the help of bacteria and thus we are able to mobilize the germanium,"" Bertau explained. 
 
Economically, the process is efficient, because the extraction of germanium can happen after plants are processed for use as biogas. Thus many of the costs are already covered in existing biogas plants. 
 
""We use the normal biogas process, collect the products of fermentation and all there is left to do then is extract the germanium from them. The processing costs of this downstream step are manageable, so even with these low amounts it is still economically viable,"" Bertau said. 
 
The potential for industry could be enormous, but there is still work to do before the benefits can be reaped. At the moment germanium can only be harvested in extremely small quantities, just a few milligrams per liter. Scientists need to achieve at least one gram per liter, which at the moment is only possible through a process of concentrating the extract. 
 
""It is as it so often is: industry is still waiting because they want to see a facility where everything is already working. Then they say: 'we'll have it'. But of course we have to complete the step in between first. Thanks to the support of the BMBF (German ministry for education and research), we have now actually found a solution to an intractable problem and have got to the point where we can upscale the process. So we will be able to work with bigger amounts, with apparatus with a capacity of 1,000 liters or 10 cubic meters instead of 20 liters,"" Bertau said.",Smart phone ingredient found in plant extracts Reuters,News,Yahoo!

They were the 100,000th passengers to pass through the facility – marking the first time a Scottish port had handled so many arrivals in a year. 
 
Regal Princess is one of a record-breaking 108,866 passengers on board 56 ships expected to arrive into Greenock this year, a 14% increase on the previous 12 months. 
 
Owner of the terminal Peel Ports believes that the record-breaking year marks a renaissance in the cruise market in Scotland. 
 
The arrival of ships such as the Queen Mary II liner as part of Cunard’s 175th anniversary celebrations, together with Britannia, the newest addition to the P&O Cruises fleet, have helped boost Greenock’s passenger numbers. 
 
Since 2007 the number of visitors calling at Greenock have more than quadrupled from 20,253 to 92,678 in 2014. 
 
The cruise industry makes a significant contribution to Scotland’s regional and local economies. Based on conservative estimates, each passenger contributes £80 to the local economy. 
 
If Greenock Cruise Terminal achieves its projected number, it will add than £10 million to the local economy. 
 
Director, Andrew Hemphill said: “Welcoming our 100,000 th passenger marks a landmark year for Greenock as we become the first Scottish port ever to do so. 
 
“But we are still only three quarters of the way through the year and there are still plenty more ships scheduled to call at the terminal, bringing a further 8,000 passengers with them.”

Fiona Giannakopoulos can't remember spending time indoors as a child. 

""Kids of this generation aren't doing enough activity,"" the mother of Madlyn, 10, and Danae, 8, said. 

""As a parent you need to put aside time every week to get children outside and engaging in activity."" 

She says the effects that regular activity has on her two children are obvious. 

""More than anything it creates a lot of positivity and they carry that into school"", Mrs Giannakopoulos said. 

""It's a good motivator and it keeps their attitudes positive."" 

Last year, Australia's youth were ranked as some of the least active in the world by the inaugural Active Kids Australia Report Card. The survey, compiled by researchers from Australian universities and endorsed by the the Heart Foundation, compared the physical activity of children among 15 nations. It found that only 19 per cent of Australians aged 5-17 years met the recommended Australian physical activity guidelines of accumulating at least 60 minutes of exercise a day. 

Childhood obesity in Australia has doubled in prevalence since the 1980s, according to a recent review from the Murdoch Children's Institute. The review, published in the Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health last month, looked at childhood obesity trends over the past 50 years, and found that in Australia the number of overweight and obese five- to 15-year-olds has increased to more than 25 per cent since 1980. 

Childhood obesity remains a complex issue, and while inactivity is not the sole cause, regular physical activity is recognised as one of the healthy habits with long-lasting benefits that can be introduced to children from a young age. 

""It's about making exercise fun,"" said Dan Clay, owner of Dangerously Fit for Kids. 

According to Clay – who remembers his childhood spent in the street riding bikes, or playing rugby with his mates – organised activities like boot camps and fun runs are a great way to get young children interested in exercise, and away from devices and screens. 

The Sun-Herald Summer Starter is a fun run taking place in Sydney on November 1. The run, which takes place on the first day of summer, has 5km and 10km courses on offer that are open to both runners and walkers. 

""We try to make a game out of it,"" Mr Clay said. ""The kids feel like they're playing but they're also getting a good workout at the same time.""

Conor D'Arcy, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The National Living Wage will give a welcome wage boost to six million workers. Pay rises don't come for free, and the expected rise will take the wage floor into uncharted territory.

Australian scientists are developing a tool to discover the wealth of natural life hidden in the depths of a tropical rainforest, by ""soundscaping"". The whirr of crickets, thrum of bird wings, distant bird song, even a hiss – perhaps of a passing reptile – all were caught in the biggest attempt yet to map landscapes for their sound.

Once captured, these sounds can be analysed to establish the health and biodiversity of an ecosystem, according to Eddie Game, Asia-Pacific lead scientist for The Nature Conservancy.

(Listen to the sounds of the Adelbert Mountains: )

The Brisbane-based Dr Game led an expedition this winter to the remote Adelbert Mountains of northern Papua New Guinea to gather sounds occurring in conservation zones agreed by local villagers.

""The reason acoustics is such a nice option is that these places in PNG are so difficult to survey by other means,"" Dr Game said on Thursday. ""It's hot and humid, thick tropical rainforest.""

So far, most work in the emerging scientific field of acoustic ecology has been done on particular species, over short intervals.

This project for the first time used remote recorders attached to trees in a 24 hour survey across entire soundscapes.

""We've taken a larger landscape approach than ever before,"" Dr Game said. ""The total area of the three communities we sampled across was 11,131 hectares. The zones we sampled ranged from 20 ha. up to nearly 2500 hectares – which is a pretty decent sized patch of largely undisturbed rainforest. ""

He said the size of the digital archive collected was ""off the charts"", consisting of thousands of different sounds.

In an initial analysis, some soundscapes turned into graphic spectrograms by scientists at the Queensland University of Technology, clearly defining groups of creatures calling at different times of day.

The US-based Nature Conservancy has been working with villagers in the Adelberts for 15 years to create conservation land use plans in forests under pressure from land clearing for food gardens, and logging.

It's hoped these recordings will provide hard evidence to make sure conservation areas are large enough to sustain key species, including cassowary, bandicoot, and birds-of-paradise.

The project may also be a forerunner for other cost-effective data-gathering efforts from difficult locations around the world.

The Yobe State Government has constituted a five man committee mandated to design modalities for effective irrigation farming. 
 
Governor Ibrahim Gaidam inaugurated the committee on Tuesday in Damaturu the capital of the state. 
 
He mandated the members to commence plans towards setting up irrigation farms spread across irrigation viable areas with a view to engaging 40,000 youths in the state. 
 
The governor also said the setting up of the task force became necessary because of the current climatic change and limited rainfall period which often had adverse effect on arable crops in the state. 
 
According to the governor, statistics show that vast 366,000 hectares of irrigation land abound in the state, out of which only 30,000 to 40,000 are being utilised, a situation he said his administration was determine to change. 
 
He also revealed that between 34,000 to 50,000 hectares had been identified which could create job for hundreds of citizens in the state. 
 
“We consider the development of irrigation as very important in the state because we can no longer continue to depend on rain-fed agriculture in view of the very serious challenges it poses to agricultural development in the state. 
 
“The situation is further aggravated by climate change, shift in growing season and limited rainfall period with the attendant effects on most arable crops in the state.” 
 
The state is endowed with 14 seasonal and perennial Rivers and streams with the Yobe River being the longest, covering a distance of over 200 kilometres which needs to be tapped to the fullest. 
 
The Chairman of the committee, Mr. Gambomi Goni, thanked the governor for considering them worthy for the appointment, saying that the assignment given to the team is a familiar terrain to all of them. 
 
Mr. Goni, a renowned agronomist, further assured the Governor that they would justify the confidence reposed in them. 
 
The committee will identify areas to site the irrigation farms, establish major irrigation schemes, reactivate or expand farms, create employment to 40,000 youths through irrigation farming across the state and also widen or dredge Oxbow Lake and waterways across the state among others. 
 
Yobe State is one of the three states in the North-East worst hit by terrorists’ activities in the last five years that has displaced over 1.5 million persons. 
 
Since the price of crude oil started dropping, the need to diversify Nigeria’s economy has forced more attention on agriculture, which was the oil-rich nation’s economic mainstay before the discovery of crude. (Channels TV)

Egypt is reportedly poised to make a cabinet reshuffle that may include up to nine ministers, following the arrest of agriculture minister 

Egypt is poised to make a cabinet reshuffle that may include up to nine ministers, local media reported on Tuesday. 

The growing speculation comes one day after Egyptian agriculture minister Salah Helal resigned ahead of a corruption probe. He has since been arrested. 

Helal ""resigned on the orders of the president"", a statement from the office of Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab said on Monday. 

Although Egyptian president Abdul Fattah al-Sisi had vowed to fight corruption, some critics view the current government as lacking the will to seriously tackle graft. 

Last week, the Egyptian prosecution service had imposed a ban on the media on reporting about the case. 

On Saturday, cabinet spokesman Hussam al-Qawish denied rumours that there will be a ministerial reshuffle, but government sources have now confirmed to the Egyptian press that a change in the line-up is expected. 

The upcoming reshuffle is expected to include the Minister of Religious Endowment Mohammed Mokhtar Jomaa. 

Other ministries potentially included in the reshuffle are those of irrigation,…",Egypt government reshuffle rumoured after corruption allegations,News,MyInforms,2015-09-08T19:04:56Z

1dcdc91a-7e26-49f9-8ed2-e54d59018d6f,"His account of a 1991 phoned threat from the first Bush White House is disputed by the alleged…  
Bill and Hillary Clinton have long believed in a unified-field theory about their opponents — one that she memorably dubbed a “vast right-wing conspiracy.” And they have their own theory of the moment it all began. 

The former president, who is about to take a more visible role in his wife’s presidential campaign, told the tale again in a broadcast over the weekend, in which he described getting a menacing phone call from inside the George H.W. Bush White House. 

It was 1991, as the then-Arkansas governor was mulling whether to challenge a popular incumbent president, he said. 

The caller said, “‘We’ve looked at the field. You’re the only one who can win,’” Bill Clinton recalled in an interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN. “‘The press has to have someone every election. We’re going to give them you. You better not run. 

’” 

Except that the man whom Clinton claims was on the other end of the line insists nothing of the kind ever happened. 

Former President Bill Clinton is interviewed by Becky Quick of CNBC at the Clinton Global Initiative Monday, Sept. 28, 2015 in New York. (Mark Lennihan/AP) 

“There is no shred of truth to it whatsoever. I never made any such call,” said Roger B. Porter, a mild-mannered policy wonk who at the time was assistant to the president for economic and domestic policy, and who now is a professor at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. 

Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward also investigated the story for his book “The Agenda,” about the turbulent early years of the Clinton White House. 

Although both Clintons have told “nine or 10 versions” of the phone call, Woodward too is convinced that “there is nothing to it” — and went so far on Monday as to call it “preposterous. 

” 

The former president, who has stayed largely offstage during his wife’s second run for the presidency, plans to step up his campaigning on her behalf. 

He filled in for her at two events in Chicago on Sept. 17 when her campaign schedule changed. Bill Clinton will also headline fundraisers in Atlanta and Kansas City later this week and Detroit later in the month, the Associated Press reported Monday. 

His higher profile comes at a moment when she is facing a stronger-than-expected challenge for the Democratic nomination from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and possibly a new opponent, should Vice President Biden get in the race. 

And Hillary Clinton’s standing in the polls has fallen amid a controversy over her use of a private e-mail account and server, rather a government one, while she was secretary of state. 

“It always happens,” Bill Clinton said in the CNN interview. “You’re seeing history repeat itself. 

” 

In his latest telling, the Whitewater scandal — which ultimately led to his impeachment — can be traced to that phone call he described receiving in 1991. 

“All of a sudden something nobody thought was an issue, Whitewater, that never turned out to be an issue winds up being a $70 million investigation,” Clinton said. “And all the hammering happened and you ask voters, do you really believe this amount to anything? No. But do you trust him as much? No. There must be something. 

” 

Clinton did not name Porter in the interview on CNN, but he did in his 2004 memoir, “My Life. 

” 

“I’ll never forget the first words of the message he had been designated to deliver: ‘Cut the crap, Governor,’” Clinton wrote, adding that Porter warned the Bush political operation would “destroy me personally. 

”

68cc1023-dbc4-40f6-85f6-91a8f9a0c372,"Five Valleys Land Trust will ask the Missoula County commissioners next week to consider spending $14,000 in open space bond money to help acquire a 200-acre conservation easement in Mormon Creek. 

The swath of land, located three miles west of Lolo, is owned by Bob Laing. The family of his late wife homesteaded the property at the turn of 20th century. 

“This piece of agricultural land is highly developable,” said Pelah Hoyt, director of the land trust. “A conservation easement would offer perpetual protection of the property.” 

Hoyt said the easement would preserve the property’s agricultural soils, along with fish and wildlife habitat, and key riparian areas. 

The area is prized for its connectivity as well – a wildlife bridge linking the Bitterroot and Sapphire mountains and the Bitterroot River. 

Five Valleys also believes the easement supports the goals set forth in the 2002 Lolo Regional Plan, which looks to “preserve significant habitats, forested areas, and intact or reestablished grasslands.” 

“This certainly fits the bill,” said Hoyt. “It’s not just a high priority for Five Valleys. This will be good for everyone involved.” 

*** 
 
The summer of 2015 has been a busy one for Five Valleys, and a successful one for preserving open space in and around Missoula. 

Five Valleys just closed on a 240-acre conservation easement at the Rich Ranch in Woodworth Meadows near Seeley Lake. The trust is close to closing on the Barmeyer property easement near Pattee Canyon. 

That $270,000 acquisition will preserve 130 acres as open space. Under the agreement, the Barmeyer family will donate 90 acres to the city and retain an additional 40 acres for private use, though it will grant a trailhead and a trail easement across that portion of the property. 

“We have as many active projects right now that we’ve ever had,” said Ryan Chapin, the stewardship director for Five Valleys. “Interest in voluntary private land conservation is at an all-time high.""

0bbe56d8-c16c-431e-9bce-510fd60053fe,"Now that 34 senators have committed to support President Obama on the Iran nuclear agreement, that deal looks certain to survive the opposition of Republicans in Congress. 

But Congress still faces an ugly September and fall, as other crises await members returning from five weeks of vacation, namely: 
A potential government shutdown  Once again hitting the debt ceiling  The highway fund running out of money  A lapse in authority for the Export-Import Bank  
In addition to the Iran deal, Congress must find a way to fund the government in the new fiscal year, which begins in just four weeks (Oct. 1). Threats abound to block that funding and force a shutdown, and issues as contentious as abortion, national security and the Confederate flag must somehow be resolved — or evaded. 

Beyond that, the federal debt is once again nudging up against the most recent limit set by Congress. The Treasury Department now says it will hit the wall in November or December. Without a higher limit, Treasury says it will not be able to meet the nation's obligations to creditors. 

And around that same time, the highway fund that pays for roads and bridges will see its authority expire as well. 

So Congress should offer us all enough suspense this month, even without a cliffhanger on the foreign-policy front. 

The Iran issue will still be the first order of business, as a deadline looms on Sept. 17. Both chambers will debate the complex agreement, and a vote to disapprove the deal is sure to pass the House. In the Senate, however, that same measure is likely to be filibustered. 

Unless the disapproval backers can muster 60 votes to stop it, that filibuster will be the end of Congress' effort to scotch the deal. (And even if 60 votes are found and the disapproval passes both chambers, it will be vetoed and the necessary two-thirds vote to override will fail — at least in the Senate, if not in the House as well.) 

Even though the outcome now seems a foregone conclusion, the Iran debate will still have to happen. It will take days. Congress will also lose two days of work to the Jewish high holidays of Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah and a third to the visit of Pope Francis. Every day counts, because Congress is woefully behind in its most important work — enacting the annual spending bills that keep the government functioning. 

Usually, by September, Congress has passed at least some of the appropriations bills needed to keep the government operating. This year, not one of the dozen bills has even received a vote on the floor of the House or Senate. 

Unless something is done to break this logjam, federal spending authority will simply end with the fiscal year — as it did for several weeks in 2013 and in 1995 and 1996. In each of the earlier instances, Republicans in Congress were at loggerheads with a Democrat in the White House. 

Government shutdown? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has pledged to prevent any such thing. House Speaker John Boehner has said the same. But so far at least, no visible progress has been made in dismantling the roadblocks. 

In the House, a fracas over Confederate flags flown in cemeteries on federal park land has paralyzed the process. Also looming is a Democratic demand that the spending caps installed in 2013 be lifted — not just for defense but for domestic programs as well. Moreover, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and his allies in both chambers said they will block any spending bill that does not defund Planned Parenthood. The White House has said it will not sign any bill that does. 

Cruz and others had tried to defund Planned Parenthood directly in July, after controversial videotapes emerged showing officials of that organization discussing the treatment of fetal tissue from abortions. Federal money cannot pay for abortions, but hundreds of millions of dollars go to Planned Parenthood to pay for other medical services every year. 

In the past, Congress often raised the limit on the national debt routinely as part of the budget process. But Republicans in the majority have made this a separate and highly featured vote. It is possible it could be included in the larger negotiations for a budget deal this month. 

Some have also argued for a longer extension of the highway fund's authority, or a restoration of the charter of the Export-Import Bank, as part of these same negotiations. The Ex-Im Bank charter lapsed over the summer because many House Republicans oppose it. House and Senate GOP leaders, however, have vowed to find a way to bring it back. 

Adding such thorny matters to a ""must pass"" bill is a time-tested technique for congressional leaders in both parties. But when the must-pass bill gets bogged down on its own, adding extra burdens may be the last thing those leaders want to do. 

So stay tuned. Once Congress gets past the Iran deal, the Jewish holidays and the pope, it will have just about a week to fashion a mega-deal accomplishing most of its work for the year.","Iran Deal Looks Like A Done Deal, So Here Are The Next Crises For Congress",News,KCBX,2015-09-03T11:14:00Z

Pradhan expects bidding to start in three months for the fields that were given up by ONGC and Oil India as they were uneconomical due to size, geography and state-set low sale prices.

The fields have reserves of about 89 million tonnes worth 700 billion rupees ($10.57 billion), Pradhan said at a press conference.

Such computerized information storage and retrieval systems typically allow one user at a time to access and modify any particular data file stored in the system. For example, while a first user has a data file checked-out, other users are prevented from checking-out the same file and modifying it. However, other users may still view, copy or print the document, while it is checked-out. Such systems do not require sophisticated conflict resolution mechanisms, as any single data file may only be modified by one user at a time. 
 
""Other systems that require synchronizing two different data files on two different computing devices require more sophisticated conflict resolution mechanisms. Most of the time, conflicts arise because the same data file has been altered on both computing devices. For example, a user changes a calendar entry on his Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), while the user's secretary concurrently changes the same calendar entry on a corporate server. During synchronization, the user is typically presented with a choice of which file to keep, e.g., the file on the PDA or the file on the desktop computer. These types of conflict resolution procedures are typically limited to the same user using two separate devices, but do not address conflicts that arise between multiple users using multiple different devices. 
 
""In light of the above, it would be highly desirable to provide a system and method for managing conflicts that arise when multiple different users and/or computing devices have access to the same data files."" 
 
In addition to the background information obtained for this patent, VerticalNews journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""According to some embodiments there is provided a computer implemented method for managing shared data conflicts. In one aspect of the method, a server stores server metadata entries corresponding to data objects, each server metadata entry including a server file name and an identifier, distinct from the server file name, for a respective data object. The server receives client metadata entries from a client, each client metadata entry corresponding to a data object for which at least one metadata parameter has changed since a prior execution of a synchronization process. Each client metadata entry includes a client file name and an identifier, distinct from the client file name, for a respective data object corresponding to the client metadata entry. The server synchronizes the received client metadata entries with corresponding server metadata entries, if any, having identifiers that match said identifiers in the received client metadata entries, without regard to whether the corresponding server metadata entries include server file names that match the client file names in the received client metadata entries.""

62dad5bf-e4c8-4058-8e0d-c7633e217512,"Garry Monk felt his Swansea City side under-performed at Vicarage Road and is now seeking a positive reaction following their 1-0 defeat at Watford. 
 
The Swans had gone into the game off the back of a 2-1 victory over Manchester United and unbeaten in the Premier League but they were undone by Odion Ighalo’s strike just short of the hour mark. 
 
Even after the Hornets had been reduced to ten men following the dismissal of Valon Behrami for a stamp on Andre Ayew, the visitors rarely threatened to get an equaliser, although Neil Taylor should have done better with a free header in injury time. 
 
The Swansea boss said: “It’s not about one person, it’s about the performance of the team. None of us today performed to the levels that we know we’re capable of and that’s unfortunate for us because we ended up losing the game. It was important game for us, we wanted to continue the momentum and form and we didn’t do it. Now we have to make sure we react the right way which this group is more than capable of and it’s my job to make sure we do that in the next game.”

Asked about Watford’s goal which originated from a long Heurelho Gomes clearance downfield, Monk said: “It summed our day up – awful. A long punt up the field, we had enough men there to deal with it and we didn’t. It’s an extremely poor goal and I’m disappointed with that.” 
 
Monk claimed he didn’t have a good view of the red card incident but after seeing a replay, he remarked: “I didn’t but I’ve just seen a replay. It was the right decision, it was a stamp and quite a nasty stamp. Whether the player meant it intentionally I don’t know but if the player’s foot is stamping on the legs it’s got to be a sending off.”",Monk: None of us performed to the levels we are capable of,News,Wimbledon Guardian,2015-09-12T17:33:15Z
689ff0c7-83e6-40c6-9edc-d62a46a1631b,"There are no shortcuts to Scottish independence and it will not happen just because supporters become ""more impatient for change"", Scotland's First Minister has said. 
 
Nicola Sturgeon said ruling out another referendum indefinitely would be wrong but she indicated that winning a second vote would not happen imminently because the concerns of those who voted No must be addressed ""patiently, carefully and comprehensively"". 
 
She said she respected the result of last year's historic ballot, which saw Scotland vote to remain part of the UK. 
 
Exactly a year after that poll, she told David Cameron he is ""living on borrowed time"" as she spoke about the prospect of a second referendum. 
 
While the Prime Minister said it was ""time to move on"" from last year's ballot, promising action to ensure the Scottish Parliament is a permanent part of the UK's political landscape, Ms Sturgeon told an audience in Edinburgh: ""We respect last year's result. 
 
""It would be wrong to propose another referendum without a fundamental change of circumstances or a strong indication that a significant number of those who voted No last year had changed their minds. 
 
""If we are to win independence, we must convince a majority of Scots that it represents the best future for Scotland. 
   Promoted stories   
""That was true last year, it is true now and it will be true at all times in the future.  There are no shortcuts. 
 
""Independence won't happen just because its supporters become more impatient for change.  An even more committed, enthusiastic and impatient 45% is still just 45%. 
 
""If Scotland is to become independent, we must build the support for independence. 
 
""Just as in the referendum campaign, it grew from 30% to 45%, we must in the years ahead take it from 45% to a clear majority. 
 
""That means we must persuade the people we failed to persuade last year. 
 
""That means understanding why they voted No. And it means addressing those concerns, patiently, carefully and comprehensively."" 
 
The SNP manifesto for next year's Holyrood elections will set out more detail about the timing and circumstances that could trigger a possible second independence referendum. 
 
Another vote could be sparked if Scotland was removed from the European Union against its wishes in the referendum that is planned before the end of 2017. 
 
Ms Sturgeon said:  ""I have said before - and I repeat again today - that if Scotland was to find itself facing an EU exit that we hadn't voted for, demand for a second independence referendum could well be unstoppable. 
 
""It would be a material change to the circumstances in which last year's vote was taken."" 
 
There has been speculation that the nationalists could also use a vote to renew the Trident nuclear weapons system, the continuation of the Conservatives' ""austerity"" economics, or failure to fully deliver on the ""vow"" of more powers for Holyrood, made by the Westminster parties just before last year's vote as triggers for another referendum. 
 
Membership of the SNP has grown from 25,000 a year ago to more than 112,000 today, while  two polls this month have suggested that a majority of Scots could now be in favour of leaving the UK. 
 
""My message to David Cameron today is the same as it was when I met him just after the general election,"" the SNP leader said. 
 
""What happens to support for independence in the months and years to come will depend as much on what you do as it will on what we do. 
 
""And, right now, you are living on borrowed time."" 
 
She told Mr Cameron: ""If you continue to ignore Scotland's voice, if you continue to disrespect the choice that people across this country made in May, more and more people will conclude that Westminster simply can't deliver for Scotland. 
 
""So, it is your choice, Prime Minister - but know that Scotland is watching."" 
 
Mr Cameron said: ""''Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon and I signed the  Edinburgh Agreement which pledged we would all respect the outcome of last  year's momentous vote. 
 
''We all agreed - as do the Scottish public - that the independence referendum  should be a 'once-in-a-generation' or a 'once-in-a-lifetime' event. So, now it  is time to move on.'' 
 
He added: ''Some may want to obsess about separation.

      storage requirements and costs  
 

		DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 3, 2015--
      Imagine Communications, a global leader in video and advertising
      solutions serving the media and entertainment, multichannel video
      programming distributors and enterprise markets, announced today the
      expansion of its industry-leading family of packaging and transcoding
      products with the introduction of SelenioNext™ Just-In-Time Transcoding
      (JITT). Based on Imagine Communications' popular SelenioNext transcoder
      for high-channel count live/linear applications, SelenioNext JITT helps
      service providers realize dramatic gains in video storage efficiency. 
 

      The on-the-fly transcoding capabilities of SelenioNext JITT
      significantly reduce the footprint of storage-intensive applications,
      such as cloud DVR (cDVR), enabling substantial savings in storage while
      reducing costs and opening up new monetization opportunities for video
      content owners and distributors. 
 

      SelenioNext JITT, a market-leading high-density just-in-time transcoder,
      allows service providers to store content in a single, high-quality bit
      rate. Additional bit rates required for multiscreen deployments are
      transcoded only when a video asset is requested for playback. The
      on-the-fly attributes of SelenioNext JITT can reduce storage
      requirements up to 80%. These efficiencies are enabled by the
      market-leading performance and density of SelenioNext JITT, a component
      of the company's CloudXtream™ DVR solution. 
 

      Integrating multiple functions into a single-server platform,
      SelenioNext JITT provides highly dense, scalable and operationally
      efficient transcoding capabilities to meet growing demand for access to
      cDVR, IPTV and live programming from mobile and other connected screens.
      SelenioNext JITT also integrates seamlessly with Imagine Communications'
      CloudXtream DVR and CloudXtream Dynamic Ad Insertion solutions, enabling
      service providers to experience substantial savings in storage while
      also generating incremental revenue through ad placements. 
 

      SelenioNext JITT is also able to breathe new life into large VOD
      libraries, enabling content to be transcoded for ABR multiscreen
      delivery as needed. SelenioNext JITT, combined with the just-in-time
      capabilities of the Imagine Communications Telurio™ Packager, allows
      service providers to stream their libraries in any required format,
      eliminating the need for transcoding and storing content in many
      bitrates and formats, including HLS, Smooth Streaming, HDS, DASH-TS and
      DASH-BMFF. This is accomplished with high capacity, high performance,
      low power consumption and industry-leading density, resulting in one of
      the lowest cost-per-output-stream ratios in the industry. 
 

      SelenioNext JITT provides: 
 
        Industry-leading Density: Up to 80 HD ABR or 160 SD ABR channels per
        2U server  
        Maximum System Redundancy: Physical hardware, N+1 video processing,
        input source and output network interface  
        Superb Video Quality: Advanced de-interlacing and compression
        techniques optimize video quality and compression efficiency at any
        bit rate and any resolution  
        Best-in-Class Power Efficiency: Less than two watts per HD profile and

        Active Balancing: Onboard resource manager load balances video streams
        across all video processors in the system, providing an integrated
        fail-safe mechanism with no disruption to other live services  

      “Video libraries and solutions require massive amounts of storage,” said
      Ron Gutman, Vice President of Technology, Imagine Communications. “A
      single copy of an HD feature-length film alone can easily consume up to
      6 gigabytes of disk space. Imagine Communications' new SelenioNext
      Just-In-Time Transcoding capability, when coupled with Imagine
      Communications' dynamic storage management system, empowers service
      providers to simultaneously optimize storage resources and smoothly
      navigate the changing landscape of digital rights management.”

434bd9b7-f5fb-44d0-a765-85472b3237cd,"Nonprofit seeking initial funding for projects from youth ages 5-21 

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. - Sept. 15, 2015 - PRLog -- Recognizing that superheroes come in all shapes, sizes – and ages – The Peterson League is now accepting grant applications from innovators ages 5 to 21. Creating “self-directed agents of positive change,” the recently launched nonprofit seeks to engage youth in projects focused on quality of life improvements for its first round of funding at www.thepetersonleague.org. 

“When launching The Peterson League, we asked ourselves, ‘How can we help everyone, from immediate impact to long-term quality of life improvement, in the most significant and permanent way possible?’” said Palyn Peterson, President, The Peterson League. “Most projects for kids are managed by adults, which can be a little disengaging. We want to create self-directed leaders who can make a real impact on the world today and in the years to come by solving important quality of life issues.” 

The organization’s goals include empowering the next generation, bringing viable ideas to life to nurture creativity and innovation, creating ongoing generations of problem-solvers to ensure long-term success, and developing future leaders who are ready to tackle new challenges. The Peterson League will reach these goals by supporting youth who are engaging in community projects, new inventions, philanthropic ventures, innovative solutions, and creative problem solving. 

Grants are separated into age groups: Superheroes (ages 5-8), Rock Stars (ages 9-12), Game Changers (ages 13-17) and Young Entrepreneurs (ages 18-21), allowing the nonprofit to provide age-appropriate support. A kid-friendly application is available online. 

“More and more, children and teenagers are the ones coming up with our world’s most innovative ideas, and it’s up to us—supportive adults—to provide these young problem-solvers with a platform to launch their ideas,” states Jill Peterson, Secretary. 

“Great ideas deserve to be nourished and encouraged from the beginning, rather than postponed until adulthood. We are thrilled to be able to support long-term positive change through a special league of our own,” added Gene Kauppila, Board Member. 

About The Peterson League 

With a focus on kickstarting youth projects, The Peterson League provides grant opportunities to U.S. citizens ages 5 to 21. The organization is dedicated to nourishing the lives and minds of children and continually supporting the youngest generation’s ideas for new innovations.

3004aca1-2205-412e-b4a4-6f3bf9b2f8a4,"I love this time of year, both at school and at church. It’s a season of regathering and in-gathering and joyful reconnection with friends after the summer’s adventures. It’s also a time when our communities are enlivened by people we meet for the first time. New students arrive with fresh questions and ideas, new children turn up in Sunday school, and visitors drop by hoping the church can help them find ways to be of service. In these bright fall days, new energies and hopes nearly crackle in the air. 

It can also be an anxious time, because we want the quality of our invitation to our communities to match the hopeful aspirations of those who come through the door. Have we planned the right programs, chosen the right curricula? As we consider the invitation we hope to offer, it’s worth remembering the things that drew us to the life of faith, the planned and the unplanned, the organized and the accidental. 

Years ago I taught a course on religious education with a gifted graduate student who recounted aspects of her Jewish education for our mostly Christian students. Her introduction to the religious life of her community included being invited by her teachers to lick honey from the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, a practice that dates back at least to the Middle Ages. This delicious invitation to the study of Hebrew linked study and sweetness forever in her imagination, as her teachers hoped it would. 

My own early memories of religious education are not as auspicious. My first Sunday school teacher was my mother, and my first memories of church are of hiding and crying under the child-sized tables because I didn’t want to share her with other children. The religious education that mattered most was the one I received with my sister under the crook of our mother’s arm as she read to us. Our sacred texts were works by Dr. Seuss, Mother Goose, Ezra Jack Keats, and Maurice Sendak. The ritual of settling in together, the repeated readings of the same stories, and the proximity of our mother bathed everything she read to us in a kind of sacredness. Snuggled up together on the couch or in bed, it felt as if we had all the time in the world to roll the words on our tongues, feel their rhythms in our bodies, and discover the secrets that a well-drawn picture could hold. My mother gave me the foundation of my religious life—the feeling of having embarked on something of inexhaustible significance, something we would never finish or solve, an open-ended mystery we could seek in our books and, in Sendak’s phrase, in “the world all around.” 

When my daughter was a little girl, I could never predict what invitation she would hear at church. Like my mother, I was my daughter’s first Sunday school teacher, and I always hoped that the stories and songs we shared in class would invite my kids into an exploration of life with God. But nothing I did came close to the impact of a “minute for mission” offered by a leader of our church. He began by talking about how he liked to wake up before the sun rose because he felt closest to God in the early morning stillness. The next morning, I woke at 5:30 to find my daughter awake and sitting at the window. “What are you doing?” I asked. “I’m watching for God, like John does,” she replied. 

These feelings and convictions—that study is as sweet as honey, that reading is as intimate and mysterious as prayer, that we long for a glimpse of God’s presence and will wake up early to seek it—are not easy to communicate, even in church. It’s hard to find the right words to express them. But these early fall days, when our communities feel the most porous, are an opportunity to try. What matters most is our willingness to speak with each other about the things that matter most to us. 

The Christian calendar gives us a saint for this work: St. Jerome, the fourth-century scholar whose translations of the Old and New Testaments formed the basis of the Latin Vulgate. September 30 is the feast day of this patron saint of translators who stands at the threshold of our rich religious inheritance and beckons us to enter. Jerome devoted his life to making scriptures first written in Hebrew and Greek available in a different language. His work of translation is our work too. 

As Jerome knew, our attempts to cross the boundaries of language draw us into relationship with others—in Jerome’s case, with the rabbis who taught him to read the Hebrew text and with the women who supported his work and shared his devotion to prayer and study. His translations opened the Bible to the people of his time and place and far beyond it. And his work of translation opened him to others’ lives. This fall we have an opportunity to translate and to be translated, to find words for what matters most to us, and to be changed by the encounter with what matters to others.",Words that count,News,Christian Century,2015-09-24T12:29:26Z
a6bea8f9-5a0f-4711-b0a1-c0b7d9b65666,"Ben Hutton can’t help believing in the power of positive thinking. 

His University of Maine coach encouraged the Vancouver Canucks prospect defenceman to read books about the triumph of mind over matter, and how to accentuate the good and eliminate the bad in any circumstance. 

And as a budding blue-liner — who has to combine a good stride in his offensively gifted game with better awareness in his own zone, a challenge for anyone coming out of the college ranks — the 22-year-old has looked confident at training camp and in this NHL pre-season. 

Despite just four AHL regular-season games with the Utica Comets last spring after his college season ended, his transition to pro has hit few potholes. 

Canucks coach Willie Desjardins said Hutton hasn’t looked intimidated, and adding offseason muscle to his 6-foot-3 frame will give the 210-pound Prescott, Ont., native a better physical presence in his own zone. 

Comets bench boss Travis Green said the 2012 fifth-round draft choice has a subtle confidence. And Canucks blue-liner Chris Tanev said Hutton is already exhibiting a pro-style patience with the puck. 

“My coach at Maine (Dennis “Red” Gendron) was really big on mindset and he had us read a few books because you need confidence to make plays when I’m jumping in and out of the rush,” Hutton recalled Thursday following a camp practice at Pacific Coliseum. 

“I’ve been fortunate here to sit beside (Dan) Hamhuis in the room and Tanev has been really great to me and calmed me down. 

“I was pretty nervous in my first (pre-season) game this year and I’m not going to lie and say I wasn’t. But Tanev just said to play my game and that it’s just the same old game, and to go out there and play with confidence.” 

Hutton got everybody’s attention in the Canucks organization after 15 goals in 35 games during the 2013-14 Hockey East season, in which he was named a first-team all-star. 

But a drop-off to nine goals with the struggling Black Bears last season — they were 8-12-2 in conference play and 22-34-5 overall — actually made Hutton a better player. He had to defend better and take few chances offensively. 

“It definitely made me a better man and person,” said Hutton. “I was battling hard and picked up better habits defensively. And Utica was a great step for me to learn the lifestyle of pro hockey and the speed and strength of the players. 

“We would play college games on Friday and Saturday or the odd Sunday — the Comets would play three in three nights. 

“And everyone is really strong and possessive with the puck in pro. I’ve got to win battles and box out and not let them get near the net. Communication is going to be huge in the D-zone.” 

Hutton’s comfort factor in all three zones isn’t surprising when you consider his transition in the game. He was a forward until age 13, and at a tryout where the first five players were asked to play defence he looked comfortable. 

In Hutton’s first year of Junior A — an early career path that would include the 2011 world challenge in Langley — he played forward until he told his coach he might be able to help out the back end. 

“We were struggling with the breakout the next year and I asked if I could try defence,” said Hutton. 

“The first shift I ended up having two assists, so he said, ‘I might keep you on D a bit.’ 

“It’s been that way ever since. And having played forward definitely helps. I know the tendencies of forwards and the defence gapping up on you when you have no options.” 

A full season with the Comets will do one of two things for Hutton. He’ll either be on the fast track to the NHL, or perhaps need another year of seasoning. 

The way he’s progressing, it could be the former. 

“He’s a very smart player,” said Tanev. “I played with him a little bit last game and on the penalty kill. He’s patient with the puck, which is good. You don’t want him to just get it and throw it away. 

“He’s not just going to shoot it off the glass or rim it around the boards, and has used the middle a few times and made some nice plays. He’s always looking to make a play and I’ve been very impressed by him. 

“This is a different game than college, where it’s more hectic. He seems to be adjusting and he’ll be just fine.” 

Which is quite the three-year progression. Hutton was fishing during the second day of the 2012 draft and didn’t think he would be selected. He had caught a bass, but when the Canucks were on the line to give him the good news, it was a day he’ll never forget and it provided all the incentive he would ever need. 

Kevin Bieksa and Frank Corrado were also fifth-round picks, and look where they are today. 

“Hutton has a great stick and a good mind for the game,” said Green. “He has a subtle confidence about him. It’s not cockiness. He’s not afraid to make a play, and you want that and you need it. 

“I’m anxious to see how he finishes up camp because it’s a battle every day.” 

OF NOTE — The Canucks have assigned centre Joe Labate to the Comets, while defenceman John Negrin has been released but will attend Utica’s camp.

fb29b6a4-4d0d-4e1e-8109-42d2a8fb5543,"For many Americans, purchasing a home is one of the biggest financial 
      investments they will make in their lifetime. GEICO emphasizes the 
      importance of protecting 
      that investment from natural disasters. 

Because natural disasters can strike in an instant, with little or no 
      warning, it is essential for homeowners to always be prepared. Disaster 
      preparations don't have to be time consuming or expensive. 
   
GEICO encourages all homeowners to protect that investment by being 
      ""disaster ready"" with these five important tips: 

1. Know your area – Become familiar with the specific risks of 
      your geographic area. Ask local officials what hazards are most likely 
      in your community. Take this information into consideration when 
      developing your preparedness plan. 

2. Evaluate your home's vulnerabilities – Hire a professional 
      home inspector to assess your home for vulnerabilities. Home inspections 
      are fairly inexpensive and can help you identify repairs necessary for 
      the safety of your home and your family. 

3. Review your coverage – Contact your homeowners insurer to 
      determine the specifics of what is covered by your policy and what is 
      not. Make sure you know about any exclusions. Your policy should be 
      designed to meet your unique needs, maximize your coverage, and minimize 
      any exposure to loss. 

4. Update your home inventory list – Maintain an up-to-date list 
      of all the items in your home. Take photos of valuables such as 
      electronics and jewelry. Store a hard-copy list in a fire-proof, 
      water-resistant, safe box and secure a digital file as well. In the 
      event that damage occurs due to a natural disaster, having a home 
      inventory will help speed up the claims process. 

5. Create and practice an emergency plan – As a family, map out 
      and practice an emergency escape route and designated family meeting 
      spot. Having a plan in place can help ease the confusion that 
      accompanies a natural disaster.

Mumbai: In the wake of surging swine flu cases, the state is going to issue guidelines for private laboratories regarding inclusion of category of patients in the lab request form. In order to keep the swine flu cases and deaths in control, the State government has provided Oseltamivir capsules and syrups for treatment. Further, four more vaccination centres in medical colleges have been identified for vaccinating pregnant women against swine Flu. 
 
A total of 2,813 cases of swine flu and 43 deaths have been reported in the city so far this year. Meanwhile, the procurement process for capsules, syrup and vaccine by the civic body is in progress. Workshops have been conducted for BMC doctors and Private medical practitioners (PMPs) in order to create awareness among PMPs about treatment, methods and prevention for swine flu and for following the standard treatment guidelines. 
The civic health department states that awareness among people, early diagnosis and treatment is the key for fighting any disease. Following this, 60, 233 posters have been displayed and 18, 000 leaflets are distributed in the communities for creating awareness among the people. 
 
Dr Minni Khetarpal, head of epidemiology cell at BMC, said, “Our major concern is to control the deaths and therefore early treatment is necessary as there are chances of deterioration in health. We have strengthened our programmes and want people to be alert.”

Kaspersky  Lab study reveals  three-quarters of consumers feel unable to protect themselves from cyber-threats  today   
   
UK consumers feel helpless about increasingly complex online threats to their personal data and identity, a new study by Kaspersky Lab has found. High profile cyber-attacks on websites including Ashley Madison and Mumsnet, are overwhelming consumers with fear for their online privacy, freezing them into a state of indecision around how best to protect themselves from cyber threats. Kaspersky Lab has termed this feeling Privacy Paralysis. 

The survey of 1,000 UK adults revealed three-quarters of consumers (77%) fear threats to their online privacy but fail to implement enough, or even any essential security measures (75%). In fact, one in three (35%) use and re-use simple passwords they can easily remember for their digital lives. 

The biggest concern for half of all respondents (48%) is their bank details becoming compromised and suffering financial loss. The threat of online identity theft is also a major worry for one in five (18%), and yet the same number of people fail to check for a secure HTTPs page before making a financial transaction (20%) - another symptom of Privacy Paralysis. 

"" T he human instinct for self-preservation in the real world doesn ' t always translate easily to the virtual one, where threats can ' t be seen or heard as they approach you.   Consumers are understandably anxious about their vulnerability online with a third (36%) doubt ing they could spot a malicious website , "" said Kirill Slavin , managing director, Kaspersky Lab.   

"" The good news is that even if you are a target,  you don ' t have to be a victim.  A reassuring 60 per cent of the people we  surveyed  believe  it ' s their own responsibility to keep themselves and their information safe online, and there  are tools and actions that can help do just that . For example, the latest edition of our consumer security solution includes features  to  stop social networks and advertisin g agencies reselling  users ' browser activity data   while  also help ing to remove all traces of user a ctivity from a Windows computer alongside  extra layers of security for online banking and shopping, "" concluded Slavin.   

The new edition of Kaspersky Lab's consumer security solution, Kaspersky Internet Security  - Multi-Device 2016 , available from September, has been enhanced to provide even stronger protection for privacy, data, identity and money as well as users' devices regardless of whether they are running on Windows, OS X or Android. 

Kaspersky Lab recommends that consumers complement security software with a number of simple security steps.  These include keeping their security software up to date so that they are protected from all current threats, setting strong and unique passwords, avoiding files from untrusted sources, sharing personal information with care and running regular malware scans on their computers.

c9ddd229-7b69-4c57-8551-ac6f592cac95,"IN a courtroom drama as confusing as it was compelling, a woman has been convicted of pretending to be a man and using a deep voice, a prosthetic penis and a blindfold to trick her female friend into having sex with her during a two-year relationship. 

Gayle Newland, 25, persuaded her victim to wear a blindfold throughout the more than 100 hours they spent together during their relationship, which started online. 

Her 25-year-old victim told Chester Crown Court that she had kept the blindfold on during about 10 sexual encounters. She remained blindfolded when the pair were sunbathing together and even when they ""watched"" a film at her flat. The deception, she said, only ended when she pulled off the blindfold while they were having sex to see her friend Gayle wearing a strap-on prosthetic penis. 

Gayle exclaimed: ""It's not what you think."" 

In her defence, Newland insisted that no blindfold was used during their relationship. She also denied strapping bandages to her chest to mask her breasts, claiming they were only there to protect a heart monitor. 

Denying five counts of sexual assault, Newland, from Willaston, Cheshire, insisted her accuser always knew she was pretending to be a man, and that they had been engaging in roleplay while her friend struggled to come to terms with her lesbianism. 

But the jury convicted Newland of three of the sexual assault charges while acquitting her of two others. 

Judge Roger Dutton warned her that imprisonment was inevitable, but adjourned the case for pre-sentencing reports, explaining that Newland had ""serious issues surrounding her personality"". 

Newland's deception begun in 2011 when she sent her victim a Facebook friend request after setting up a fake account in the name of ""Kye Fortune"" by downloading photos from an American man's Myspace page. 

During online and phone communication, ""Mr Fortune"" told the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, that ""he"" had a close friend called Gayle Newland. The victim then became friends with Newland as well as Mr Fortune. 

The victim said she noticed that Mr Fortune and Newland, who at the time was a Chester University student, had ""really similar accents, [but] his was just a bit deeper"". Describing how she fell for the con, she told the court: ""When you Googled him, it came up with a Twitter account, Facebook account, a Bebo account. He seemed a feasible person. I'm still in shock... coincidences keep flashing in front of me, like how Gayle and Kye shared the same birthday."" 

The pair finally met face-to-face in February 2013, but ""Mr Fortune"" insisted on the blindfold, claiming he was embarrassed about scars on his body from being involved in a car accident and receiving treatment for a brain tumour. 

The court heard how the victim also agreed to rules that included not touching Mr Fortune's genitals. 

As the romance blossomed, the victim said, they would sometimes snuggle up in front of a film. She added: ""I would not say 'watch' because I had a mask and scarf on. I heard a film. For us, that was what was normal. In hindsight, I wish I had ripped that mask off sooner."" 

The couple eventually got engaged. The victim, who insisted she was not attracted to women, said: ""I told my friends I was engaged to a guy. Every time I met up with Kye Fortune, I either had the mask on already or he would wait outside the door and I would put it on. I was so desperate to be loved. It's pathetic. 

The deception ended, she told the court, while they were having sex: ""I grabbed for the back of his head and my hand got caught on something. It did not feel right. 

""Something in my mind said, 'Pull it [the blindfold] off'. I just pulled it off. Gayle was standing there... I just couldn't believe it."" 

As the judge told Newland she faced ""serious consequences"" after the jury returned their guilty verdict, she protested: ""How can you send me down for something I have not done?"" She repeated tearfully: ""I don't understand... I don't understand."" 

""If I could go back and scream at me, I would. It does look ridiculous on paper.""",Woman tricks friend into sex by pretending to be a man,News,Morning Bulletin,2015-09-15T14:00:00Z

0246e5a4-33ab-49c1-bf29-d350d7fdecaa,"BELFAST, Northern Ireland, Sept. 30 (UPI) -- For some unlucky eaters, the presence of marine toxins in mussels, clams, shrimp and other shelled seafood causes diarrhetic shellfish poisoning. 
 
A new device promises to more efficiently and quickly detect the presence of such toxins and prevent sickness-causing shellfish from making it to the kitchen. 
 
The device, designed by a team of diagnostics scientists from the U.S. and Europe, tests for the presence of okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysis toxins, which are produced by some algal blooms and absorbed by filter-feeding shellfish. 
 
To protect consumers from tainted shellfish, regulators require samples from fishermen's hauls to be sent away and tested at labs with specialized diagnostic equipment. The new device, however, is small, portable and offers instant results, enabling shellfish to be tested on the spot -- whether on a fishing boat or at the docks. 
 
The device's development was led by researcher Waqass Jawaid, a scientists with diagnostics company Neogen Europe Limited and Queen's University's Institute for Global Food Security. 
 
In a press release , Jawaid and his colleagues promised their new mobile device ""maintained the rigorous testing standards of off-site labs."" 
 
Researchers say the device works like a pregnancy test using an antibody that binds and reacts to the presence of three common okadaic acid toxins. The technology is called a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). Twenty-minute results mean shellfish with positive tests can be discarded before ever making it to shore. 
 
""If the LFIA readout is negative, then an additional, easy-to-use test could be conducted dockside for 'total toxins,' which would include detection of a fourth type of OA,"" researchers explained. 
 
The new device is detailed in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry .

WASHINGTON — This time, they suited up. 

The three young Americans, one of whom was Roseburg resident Alek Skarlatos, who thwarted a gunman on a Paris-bound passenger train last month got their moment in the Oval Office on Thursday. And they dressed for it. 

President Barack Obama praised Skarlatos, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler for teamwork, courage and quick-thinking actions that averted ""a real calamity."" 

He celebrated them as three friends who had been headed for a fun reunion in Paris when they ""ended up engaging a potential catastrophic situation and pinning down someone who clearly was intent on doing a lot of harm to a lot of people, inflicting terror on the French people."" 

The three sat attentively on an Oval Office couch and chair as Obama praised them as ""the very best of America."" 

They previously had been awarded France's highest honor by President Francois Hollande. They showed up for that hastily scheduled ceremony at the ornate Elysee Palace a little underdressed — in polo shirts and khakis. 

This time, Oregon National Guardsman Skarlatos and Airman 1st Class Stone were in military uniform, and Sadler, a senior at Sacramento State University, wore a sport coat and open-collared dress shirt. 

""It's these kinds of young people who make me extraordinarily optimistic about the future,"" Obama said. 

The three last month subdued a man with ties to radical Islam who boarded the train with a Kalashnikov rifle, a pistol and a box cutter. A British businessman and a French-American also have been praised for their efforts to stop the gunman. 

As for what the future holds, Obama said Stone, whose hand was injured in the attack, is ""making real progress"" and intends to pursue work in medicine, Sadler is studying sports medicine and therapy, and Skarlatos ""as soon as he's finished on 'Dancing with the Stars,' plans to get into law en…",Obama lauds trio -- including Oregonian Alek Skarlatos -- for heroics on French train,News,MyInforms,2015-09-17T18:51:16Z

Research and Markets ( http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/js4ncq/europe_food ) has announced the addition of the ""Europe Food Additives Market - Segmented by Type (Preservatives, Sweeteners, Hydrocolloids, Colorants, others), Application (Dairy & Frozen, bakery, Meat products, Beverages, Confectionary, others) & Geography"" report to their offering. 
  
The demand for food additives market was largely driven to address the supply chain complexities. Growing concerns on health among the ageing population is driving the market for natural food additives in the European region. Due to growing concerns on the safety of food additives, EU legislation laid down stringent regulations for products entering the EU market. Food additives, enzymes and flavorings should be approved by EU before being marketed in Europe . Products with labelling, and compliance with minimum added levels are the key factors seen as a constraint for entering the Europe market. 

The food additives market is segmented by type viz. Preservatives, Food flavors and Flavor enhancers, Antioxidants, Sweeteners, Emulsifiers, Anti Caking agents, Enzymes, Fat replacers, Acidulants and others (texturizer, shelf life stabilizers, etc). The fastest growing segment is the Sweetener type which is seen as an alternative to sugar used in food and beverages. In UK, the Food standard agency estimated 850,000 cases of food poisoning and without preservatives the number would be much higher. 

 
Food Additives find major applications in Fruits & vegetables, Bakery & Confectionary, Dairy & Frozen products, Oils & Fats, Savory snacks, Meat poultry & Sea food products. 

During recession, The European markets recorded minimal decrease in the food and beverage industry when compared to drastic fall in production in other industrial segments. That said, any slightest uptick in economy will boost the demand for European packaged foods and food additives market, as consumers tend to splurge first on food items. France and Germany are the largest market, followed by UK, Spain , Italy and Russia . 

The major players in the market are Cargill, Tate & Lyle, Palsgaard, DuPont, DSM, Givaudan, Brenntag, Novozymes, International Flavors and Fragrances, etc.

 Research and Markets ( http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/cmjs2l/autoimmune_drug )       has announced the addition of the ""AutoImmune       Drug Focus Issue"" newsletter to their offering. 
 
This first approved generic glatiramer acetate has been a long time       coming, but the hesitancy in launching shows that the battle to produce       a generic Copaxone is not yet over. FDA approval will nonetheless give       Sandoz (Novartis) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals grounds to urge the courts       to expedite their decision over Copaxone's patents; a launch can be       expected immediately upon settlement of this consideration. 
 
A business publication for tracking autoimmune developments worldwide

face4d62-b09a-4651-8bb2-b3f659985b91,"New Delhi: The Central government has decided to withdraw the controversial draft encryption policy that t made it mandatory to save all messages - be it through email, SMS or WhatsApp – for 90 days. 
 
The New Encryption Policy had triggered widespread privacy concerns as it sought to store all messages and to hand them over to security agencies on demand. 
 
What the policy had proposed first? 
 
Every message that you send - be it through WhatsApp, SMS, Email or any such service - must be mandatorily stored in plain text format for 90 days and made available on demand to security agencies under a draft New Encryption Policy. 
 
Legal action that could also include imprisonment had been proposed in the draft policy unveiled by the government for failure to store and produce on demand the encrypted messages sent from any mobile device or computer. The policy also wanted everyone to hand over their encryption keys to the government. 
 
The draft proposed that users of encrypted messaging service on demand should reproduce same text, transacted during a communication, in plain format before law enforcement agencies and failing which the government can take legal action as per the laws of the country. 
 
The proposed policy, issued by the Department of Electronics and Information Technology, would apply to everyone including government departments, academic institutions, citizens and for all kind of communications - be it official or personal. 
 
Generally, all the modern messaging services such as WhatsApp, Viber, Line, Google Chat, Yahoo messenger etc, come with high level of encryption and many a time security agencies find it hard to intercept these messages. 
 
""All information shall be stored by the concerned B/C entity for 90 days from the date of transaction and made available to Law Enforcement Agencies as and when demanded in line with the provisions of the laws of the country,"" the draft said. 
 
""The common man is not likely to be impacted by this (proposal),"" an IT Ministry spokesperson said. 
 
In case of the user having communicated with foreigner or entity abroad then the primary responsibility of providing readable plain text along with the corresponding encrypted information would be that of the user in the country. 
 
Besides this, all service providers located within and outside India that use encryption technology for providing any type of services in India must register themselves with the government, as per the draft. 
 
The draft proposes to introduce the New Encryption Policy under section 84 A of Information Technology Act 2000. This section was introduced through amendment in 2008. 
 
The sub-section 84 C that was also introduced through the amendment has provision of imprisonment for violation of the act. 
 
""Encryption products may be exported but with prior intimation to the designated agency of Government of India. Users in India are allowed to use only the products registered in India. Government reserves the right to take appropriate action as per Law of the country for any violation of this Policy,"" the draft said. 
 
The last date for public to comment on the draft is October 16, 2015.

5f644a92-f3aa-4708-902d-2e1accfe484a,"Video comes one day after Trump unloaded on Jeb with video juxtaposing his pro-immigrant positions with mugshots of illegal immigrant killers Anti-Trump YouTube mashup catches Trump sounding more like a Democrat than a conservative Republican Trump has said he's 'evolved' on the issues conservatives will care most about in the GOP presidential primary season Some clips in Bush's new video are at least 16 years old Jeb complained Tuesday that Trump 'personalizes everything. If you're not totally in agreement with him, you're an 'idiot,' or 'stupid''  
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has decided to launch a full-frontal assault on Donald Trump, the populist billionaire Republican whose improbable poll numbers have made him – at times literally – a piñata for his rivals. 

In an online video released Tuesday, Bush hammers the GOP presdiential front-runner for taking positions over the years that are more closely aligned with the Democratic Party than with the party of Lincoln.  

Titled 'The real Donald Trump, it features The Donald praising former secretary of state Hillary Clinton as a 'terrific woman,' declaring himself 'very pro-choice' and saying that as a New Yorker his views are 'different than if I lived in Iowa.' 

Iowa will be the first state to hold presdiential nominating caucuses next year. 

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 
   
TRUMPED? The Donald is on the receiving end of a nasty new YouTube video from Jeb Bush's campaign 
   
ON OFFENSE: Bush has taken the gloves off and is openly attacking Trump for taking left-of-center political positions over the years 
   
'A TERRIFIC WOMAN': Trump praised Hillary Clinton more than a decade ago when he was a registered Democrat 

The video's creators begin the 80-second show with graphics announcing 'Liberal things Trump says' and'liberal things Trump believes.' 

Most of the clips are ancient history – one dates to October 1999 – but a Trump statement from last month's Republican debate in Cleveland, Ohio also made the cut. 

'As far as single-payer [health care], it works in Canada, it works incredibly well in Scotland,' Trump said on August 6. Deploying those words is a move calculated to cause trouble for the real estate tycoon with conservatives who want to see the Obamacare law repealed. 

Similarly, his warm words for Clinton depict him as friendly to the woman who has become public enemy no. 1 for the GOP.  

'I think Hillary would do a good job' negotiating a hypothetical 'deal with Iran,' Trump says in one video segment.. 

'Hillary Clinton, I think, is a terrific woman,' he confirms in another piece of historical footage. 'I mean, I'm a little biased because I've known her for years.' 
    
NO BIGGEE? Trump tweeted his prediction that his teflon coating would insulate him from the Bush attack, adn that it would be Jeb who sees his poll numbers tank as a result 

Bush's video also portrays Trump as friendly toward President Barack Obama's 2009 economic stimulus package and favoring tax increases on high-income Americans. 

'You'd probably be shocked if I said that in many cases I probably identify more as a Democrat,' he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an interview that has already been played and replayed ad nauseum. 

The Bush ad hammers the point home by featuring it again. 

Trump responded with a pair of messages on Twitter blasting Bush as a politician who' is beholden to donors whose contributions paid for the video. 

'Jeb is spending millions of dollars on ""hit"" ads funded by lobbyists & special interests,' he tweeted. 'Bad system.' 

'While millions are being spent against me in attack ads,' he added in a second tweet, 'they are paid for by the ""bosses"" and ""owners"" of candidates. I am self funding.' 

Tuesday's YouTube release comes just one day after Trump hammered Bush with a 15-second Instagram video juxtaposing his comparatively soft immigration positions with mugshots of accused and convicted killers who were in the United States illegally. 

Bush said last year that many people who sneak across the Border are committing 'an act of love' by taking risks to gain a better living standard for their families. 

The two pols have been at each other's in recent weeks, with Trump goading the former governor for being 'low energy' and putting his campaign crowds to sleep.  
   
STEALTH DEMOCRAT? Bush's video team replayed Trump's oft-cited but ancient interview in which he sounded like the opposite of the red-meat conservative he would later become 
   
HARDBALL: Trump hit Bush on Monday with an Instagram video linking illegal-immigrant murderers with the former governor's position that some border-crossers are committing 'an act of love' 

Bush in turm has accused Trump of being a phony conservative who would put into place hyper-aggressive immigration policies that, he says, would be ineffective and wildly expensive for taxpayers. 

Other Republican White House hopefuls have gone on offense against Trump during the summer, most notably South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.  

All three lost ground in the polls after they launched their rhetorical attacks. Graham is polling between zero and 1 per cent nationally, and Perry's campaign is drained of cash and on life support. 

'Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign,' Trump tweeted on Tuesday. 'Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me?' 
  THE 2016 FIELD: WHO'S IN AND WHO'S THINKING IT OVER   
A whopping 22 people from America's two major political parties have declared themselves candidates in the 2016 presidential election. 

The field includes two women, an African-American and two Latinos. All but one in that group – Hillary Clinton – are Republicans.  

At 17 candidates, the GOP field is deeper than ever. A few Democrats are still assessing their chances at succeeding in a much smaller group of five whose front-runner has been defined from the very beginning. 

REPUBLICANS IN THE RACE   
   
Jeb Bush        Former Florida governor 

Age:  62 

Religion:  Catholic 

Base: Moderates   

                  Résumé:  Former Florida governor and secretary of state. Former co-chair of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. 

Education: B.A. University of Texas at Austin. 

Family: Married to Columba Bush (1974), with three adult children. Noelle Bush has made news with her struggle with drug addiction, and related arrests. George P. Bush was elected Texas land commissioner in 2014. Jeb's father George H.W. Bush was the 41st President of the United States, and his brother George W. Bush was number 43. 

Claim to fame:  Jeb was an immensely popular governor with strong economic and jobs credentials. He is also one of just two GOP candidates who is fluent in Spanish. 

Achilles heel:  Bush has angered conservatives with his permissive positions on illegal immigration (saying some border-crossing is 'an act of love) and common-core education standards. His last name could also be a liability with voters who fear establishing a family dynasty in the White House. 
   
Chris Christie         New Jersey governor 

Age: 52 

Religion:   Catholic 

Base: Establishment-minded conservatives 

Résumé:  Governor of New Jersey. Former U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. Former Morris County freeholder and lobbyist. 

Governor of New Jersey. Former U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. Former Morris County freeholder. Former statehouse lobbyist. 

Education: B.A. University of Delaware, Newark, J.D. Seton Hall University. 

Family: Married to Mary Pat Foster (1986) with four children. 

Claim to fame:  Pugnacious and unapologetic, Christie once told a heckler to 'sit down and shut up' and brings a brash style to everything he does. That includes the post-9/11 criminal prosecutions of terror suspects that made his reputation as a hard-charger. 

Achilles heel:  Christie is often accused of embracing an ego-driven and needlessly abrasive style. His administration continues to operate under a 'Bridgegate' cloud: At least two aides have been indicted in an alleged scheme to shut down lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge as political retribution for a mayor who refused to endorse the governor's re-election. 
   
Carly Fiorina          Former CEO 

Age:  60 

Religion:       Episcopalian  

Base: Conservatives 

                Résumé:  Former CEO of Hewett-Packard. Former group president of Lucent Technologies. Former U.S. Senate candidate in California. 

Education: B.A. Stanford University. UCLA School of Law (did not finish). M.B.A. University of Maryland. M.Sci. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

Family: Married to Frank Fiorina (1985), with one adult step-daughter and another who is deceased. She has two step-grandchildren. Divorced from Todd Bartlem (1977-1984). 

Claim to fame:  Fiorina was the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company, something that could provide ammunition against the Democratic Party's drive to make Hillary Clinton the first female president. She is also the only woman in the 2016 GOP field, making her the one Republican who can't be accused of sexism. 

Achilles heel:  Fiorina's unceremonious firing by HP's board has led to questions about her management and leadership styles. And her only political experience has been a failed Senate bid in 2010 against Barbara Boxer. 
   
Lindsey Graham   South Carolina senator 

Age:  59 

Religion:         Southern Baptist 

Base: Otherwise moderate war hawks   

Résumé:  U.S. senator. Retired Air Force Reserves colonel. Former congressman. Former South Carolina state representative. 

Education: B.A. University of South Carolina. J.D. University of South Carolina Law School. 

Family: Never married. Raised his sister Darline after their parents died while he was a college student and she was 13. 

Claim to fame:  Graham is a hawk's hawk, arguing consistently for greater intervention in the Middle East, once arguing in favor of pre-emptive military strikes against Iran. His influence was credited for pushing President George W. Bush to institute the 2007 military 'surge' in Iraq. 

Achilles heel:  Some of his critics have taken to call him 'Grahamnesty,' citing his participating in a 2013 'gang of eight' strategy to approve an Obama-favored immigration bill. He has also aroused the ire of conservative Republicans by supporting global warming legislation and voting for some of the president's judicial nominees. 

  
 
Bobby Jindal      Louisiana governor 

Age: 44 

Religion:  Catholic 

Base: Social conservatives 

                  Résumé:  Governor of Louisiana. Former congressman. Former Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Planning and Evaluation. Former Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. 

Education: B. Sci. Brown University. M.Litt. New College at Oxford University 

Family: Married to Supriya Jolly (1997), with three children, each of whom has an Indian first name and an American middle name. Bobby Jindal's given name is Piyush. 

Claim to fame:  Jindal's main source of national attention has been his strident opposition to federal-level 'Common Core' education standards, which included a federal lawsuit that a judge dismissed in late March. He is also outspoken on the religious-freedom issues involved in mainstreaming gay marriage into the lives of American Christians. 

Achilles heel:  During his first term as governor, Jindal signed a science education law that requires schools to present alternatives to the theory of evolution, including religious creationism. His staunch defense of businesses that want to steer clear of providing services to same-sex couples at their weddings will win points among evangelicals but alienate others. 
  
 
George Pataki       Former New York governor   

Age:  69  

Religion :  Catholic 

Base :  Centrists               

Résumé:  Former governor of New York. Former New York state senator and state assemblyman. Former mayor of Peekskill, NY. 

Education: B.A. Yale University. J.D. Columbia Law School. 

Family: Married to Libby Rowland (1973), with four adult children. 

Claim to fame: Pataki was just the third Republican governor in New York's history, winning an improbable victory over three-term incumbent Mario Cuomo in 1994. He was known for being a rare tax-cutter in Albany and was also the sitting governor when the 9/11 terror attacks rocked New York CIty in 2001. 

Achilles heel:  While Pataki's liberal-leaning social agenda plays well in the Empire State, it won't win him any fans among the GOP's conservative base. He supports abortion rights and gay rights, and has advocated strongly in favor of government intervention to stop global warming, which right-wingers believe is overblown as a global threat. 
 
Rick Perry         Former Texas governor   

Age:  65   

Religion: Christian (nondenominational) 

Base: Conservatives   

Résumé:  Former Texas governor, lieutenant governor, agriculture commissioner and state representative. 

Education: B.Sci. Texas A&M University 

Family: Married to Anita Thigpen (1982) with two adult children. His father was a former Democratic county commissioner in Texas. 

Claim to fame: Perry boasts that while he was governor between the end of 2007 and the end of 2014, the Texas economy created 1.4 million new jobs while the rest of the U.S. lost close to 400,000. A Perry-led Texas also had the nation's highest high school graduation rate among Hispanics and African-Americans. 

Achilles heel:  Perry has a tough hill to climb after his 2012 presidential campaign spectacularly imploded with a single word – 'Oops' – after he couldn't remember one of his own talking points during a nationally televised debate. He also faces an indictment for alleged abuse of power in a case that Republicans contend is politically motivated and meritless. 

  
 
Rick Santorum      Former Penn. senator 

Age:  57 

Religion: Catholic 

Base: Evangelicals   

  

Résumé:  Former US senator and former member of the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. Former lobbyist who represented World Wrestling Entertainment. 

Education: B.A. Penn State University. M.B.A. University of Pittsburgh. J.D. Penn State University Dickinson School of Law. 

Family: Married to Karen Santorum (1990), with seven living children. One baby was stillborn in 1996. Another, named Isabella, is a special needs child with a genetic disorder. 

Claim to fame:  Santorum won the 2012 Republican Iowa Caucuses by a nose. He won by visiting all of Iowa's 99 states in a pickup truck belonging to his state campaign director, a consultant who now worls for Donald Trump. 

Achilles heel:  As a young lobbyist, Santorum persuaded the federal government to exempt pro wrestling from regulations governing the use of anabolic steroids. And the stridently conservative politician has attracted strong opposition from gay rights groups. One gay columnist held a contest to redefine his name, buying the 'santorum.com' domain to advertise the winning entry – which is too vulgar to print. 
 
Scott Walker      Wisconsin governor 

Age:  47 

Religion:  Christian (nondenominational) 

Base: Conservative activists     

Résumé:  Governor of Wisconsin. Former Milwaukee County Executive. Former member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. 

Education: Marquette University (did not finish) 

Family: Married to Tonette Tarantino (1993), with two children. One of Mrs. Walker's cousins is openly lesbian and was married in 2014, with the Walkers attending the reception. 

Claim to fame:  Walker built his national fame on the twin planks of turning his state's past budget shortfalls into surpluses and beating back a labor-union-led drive to force him out of office through a recall election. Both results have broad appeal in the GOP. 

Achilles heel:  Wisconsin has suffered from a shaky economy during Walker's tenure, which makes him look weak compared with other governors who presided over more robust job-creation numbers. He promised to create 250,000 private sector jobs but delivered less  than 60 per cent of them. Also, he led an effort in the state legislature to enact $800 million in tax cuts – putting the Badger State back on the road to government deficits. 
     
Ben Carson        Retired Physician 

Age:  63 

Religion:               Seventh-day Adventist 

Base: Evangelicals 

            Résumé:  Famous pediatric neurosurgeon, youngest person to head a major Johns Hopkins Hospital division. Founder of the Carson Scholars Fund, which awards scholarships to children of good character. 

Education: B.A. Yale University. M.D. University of Michigan Medical School. 

Family: Married to Candy Carson (1975), with three adult sons. The Carsons live in Maryland with Ben's elderly mother Sonya, who was a seminal influence on his life and development.  

Claim to fame:  Carson spoke at a National Prayer Breakfast in 2013, railing against political correctness and condemned Obamacare – with President Obama sitting just a few feet away. 

Achilles heel:  Carson is inflexibly conservative, opposing gay marriage and once saying gay attachments formed in prison provided evidence that sexual orientation is a choice. 
   
Ted Cruz             Texas senator 

Age: 44 

Religion :         Southern Baptist 

Base: Tea partiers 

                    Résumé:  U.S. senator. Former Texas solicitor general. Former U.S. Supreme Court clerk. Former associate deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush. 

Education: B.A. Princeton University. J.D. Harvard Law School. 

Family: Married to Heidi Nelson Cruz (2001), with two young daughters. His father is a preacher and he has two half-sisters. 

Claim to fame:  Cruz spoke on the Senate floor for more than 21 hours in September 2013 to protest the inclusion of funding for Obamacare in a federal budget bill. (The bill moved forward as written.) He has called for the complete repeal of the medical insurance overhaul law, and also for a dismantling of the Internal Revenue Service. Cruz is also outspoken about border security. 

Achilles heel:  Cruz's father Rafael, a Texas preacher, is a tea party firebrand who has said gay marriage is a government conspiracy and called President Barack Obama a Marxist who should 'go back to Kenya.' Cruz himself also has a reputation as a take-no-prisoners Christian evangelical, which might play well in South Carolina but won't win him points in the other early primary states and could cost him momentum if he should be the GOP's presidential nominee. 
   
Jim Gilmore      Former Virginia governor 

Age: 65 

Religion:  United Methodist 

Base: Conservatives 

Résumé:  Former governor and attorney general of Virginia. Former chairman of the Republican National Committee. Former U.S. Army intelligence agent. President and CEO of the Free Congress Foundation. Board member of the National Rifle Association 

Education: B.A. University of Virginia. 

Family: Married to Roxane Gatling Gilmore (1977), with two adult children. Mrs. GIlmore is a survivor of Hodgkin's lymphoma 

Claim to fame:  Gilmore presided over Virginia when the 9/11 terrorists struck in 1991, guiding the state through a difficult economic downturn after one of the hijacked airliners crashed into the Pentagon. He is nest known in Virginia for eliminating most of a much-maligned personal property tax on automobiles, working with a Democratic-controlled state legislature to get it passed and enacted. 

Achilles heel:  Gilmore is the only GOP or Democratic candidate for president who has been the chairman of his political party, giving him a rap as an 'establishment' candidate. A social-conservative crusader, he is loathed by the left for championing the state law that established 24-hour waiting periods for abortions. Gilmore also has a reputation as an indecisive campaigner, having dropped out of the 2008 presidential race in July 2007.  
   
Mike Huckabee      Former Arkansas governor 

Age: 59 

Religion:  Southern Baptist  

Base: Evangelicals 

Résumé:  Former governor and lieutenant governor of Arkansas. Former Fox News Channel host. Ordained minister and author. 

Education: B.A. Ouachita Baptist University. Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (did not finish).  

Family: Married to Janet Huckabee (1974), with three adult children. Mrs. Huckabee is a survivor of spinal cancer. 

Claim to fame:  'Huck' is a political veteran and has run for president before, winning the Iowa Caucuses in 2008 and finishing second for the GOP nomination behind John McCain. He's known as an affable Christian and succeeded in building a huge following on his weekend television program, in which he frequently sat in on the electric bass with country & western groups and other 'wholesome' musical entertainers. 

Achilles heel:  Huckabee may have a problem with female voters. He complained in 2014 about Obamacare's mandatory contraception coverage, saying Democrats want women to 'believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar.' He earned more scorn for hawking herbal supplements in early-2015 infomercials as a diabetes cure, something he has yet to disavow despite disagreement from medical experts. 
   
John Kasich        Ohio governor   

Age:  63  

Religion :  Anglican 

Base :  Centrists           

                                            Résumé:  Governor of New York. Former chairman of the U.S. House Budget Committee. Former Ohio congressman. Former Ohio state senator. 

Education: B.A. The Ohio State University. 

Family: Married to Karen Waldbillig (1997). Divorced from Mary Lee Griffith (1975-1980). 

Claim to fame: Kasich was Ohio youngest-ever member of the state legislature at age 25. He's known for a compassionate and working-class sensibility that appeals to both ends of the political spectrum. In the 1990s when Newt Gingrich led a Republican revolution that took over Congress, Kasich became the chairman of the House Budget Committee – a position for a wonk's wonk who understands the nuanced intricacies of how government runs. 

Achilles heel:  Some of Kasich's political positions rankle conservatives, including his choice to expand Ohio's Medicare system under the Obamacare law, and his support for the much-derided 'Common Core' education standards program.  

  
 
Rand P aul      Kentucky senator 

Age: 52 

Religion: Presbyterian  

Base: Libertarians  

                  Résumé:  US senator. Board-certified ophthalmologist. Former congressional campaign manager for his father Ron Paul. 

Education: Baylor University (did not finish). M.D. Duke University School of Medicine. 

Family: Married to Kelley Ashby (1990), with three sons. His father is a former Texas congressman who ran for president three times but never got close to grabbing the brass ring. 

Claim to fame: Paul embraces positions that are at odds with most in the GOP, including an anti-interventionist foreign policy, reduced military spending, criminal drug sentencing reform for African-Americans and strict limits on government electronic surveillance – including a clampdown on the National Security Agency. 

Achilles heel:  Paul's politics are aligned with those of his father, whom mainstream GOPers saw as kooky. Both Pauls have advocated for a brand of libertarianism that forces government to stop domestic surveillance programs and limits foreign military interventions. 
 
Marco Rubio          Florida senator 

Age:  43 

Religion:           Catholic 

Base: Conservatives 

Résumé:  US senator, former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, former city commissioner of West Miami 

Education: B.A. University of Florida. J.D. University of Miami School of Law. 

Family: Married to Jeanette Dousdebes (1998), with two sons and two daughters. Jeanette is a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader who posed for the squad's first swimsuit calendar.  

Claim to fame:  Rubio's personal story as the son of Cuban emigres is a powerful narrative, and helped him win his Senate seat in 2010 against a well-funded governor whom he initially trailed by 20 points. 

Achilles heel:  Rubio was part of a bipartisan 'gang of eight' senators who crafted an Obama-approved immigration reform bill in 2013 which never became law – a move that angered conservative Republicans. And he was criticized in 2011 for publicly telling a version of his parents' flight from Cuba that turned out to appear embellished. 
   
Donald Trump      Real estate developer 

Age:  69 

Religion:      Presbyterian  

Base: Conservatives                  

Résumé:  Chairman of The Trump Organization. Fixture on the Forbes 400 list of the world's richest people. Star of 'Celebrity Apprentice.' 

Education: B.Sci. Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania 

Family: Married to Melania Trump (2005). Divorced from Ivana Zelníčková (1977-92) and Marla Maples(1993–99). Five grown children. Trump's father Fred Trump amassed a $400 million fortune developing real estate. 

Claim to fame:  Trump's niche in the 2016 campaign stems from his celebrity as a reality-show host and his enormous wealth – more than $10 billion, according to Trump. Because he can self-fund an entire presidential campaign, he is seen as less beholden to donors than other candidates. He has grabbed the attention of reporters and commentators by unapologetically staking out controversial positions and refusing to budge in the face of criticism. 

Achilles heel:  Trump is a political neophyte who has toyed with running for president and for governor of New York, but shied away from taking the plunge until now. His billions also have the potential to alienate large swaths of the electorate. And his Republican rivals have labeled him an ego-driven celeb and an electoral sideshow because of his all-over-the-map policy history – much of which agreed with today's today's democrats – and his past enthusiasm for anti-Obama 'birtheris 

DEMOCRATS IN THE RACE   
   
Lincoln Chafee   Former Rhode Island governor 

Age:  62 

Religion:   Episcopalian 

Base:  Centrists 

Résumé: Former Rhode Island governor. Former U.S. senator. Former city councilman and mayor of Warwick, RI. 

Education:  B.A. Brown University. Graduate, Montana State University horseshoeing school. 

Family: Married to Stephanie Chafee (1990) with three children. Like him, his father John Chafee was a Rhode Island governor and US senator, but also served as Secretary of the Navy. Lincoln was appointed to his Senate seat when his father died in office. 

Claim to fame:  While Chafee was a Republican senator during the George W. Bush administration, he cast his party's only vote in 2002 against a resolution that authorized military action in Iraq. Hillary Clinton, also a senator then, voted in favor – giving him a point of comparison that he hopes to ride to victory. 

Achilles heel:  Chafee's lack of any significant party loyalty has turned allies into foes throughout his political career, and Democrats aren't sure he's entirely with them now. He was elected to the Senate as a Republican in 2000 but left the party and declared himself a political independent after losing a re-election bid in 2006. As an independent, he was elected governor in 2010. Now he's running for president as a Democrat. 

  
 
Martin O' Malley     Former Maryland governor 

Age:  52 

Religion:  Catholic 

Base:  Centrists   

                              Résumé: Former Maryland governor. Former city councilor and mayor of Baltimore, MD. Former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. 

Education:  B.A. Catholic University of America. J.D. University of Maryland. 

Family: Married to Katie Curran (1990) and they have four children. Curran is a district court judge in Baltimore. Her father is Maryland's attorney general. O'Malley's mother is a receptionists in the Capitol Hill office of Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski. 

Claim to fame:  O'Malley pushed for laws in Maryland legalizing same-sex marriage and giving illegal immigrants the right to pay reduced tuition rates at public universities. But he's best known for playing guitar and sung in a celtic band cammed 'O'Malley's March.' 

Achilles heel:  O'Malley may struggle in the Democratic primary since he endorsed Hillary Clinton eight years ago. If he prevails, he will have to run far enough to her left to be an easy target for the GOP. He showed political weakness when his hand-picked successor lost the 2014 governor's race to a Republican. But most troubling is his link with Baltimore, whose 2016 race riots have made it a nuclear subject for politicians of all stripes. 
 
Jim Webb       Former Virginia senator 

Age:  69 

Religion:  Christian (nondenominational) 

Base:  War hawks and economic centrists 

Résumé: Former U.S. senator from Virginia. Former U.S. Secretary of the Navy under Ronamd Reagan. Former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs. 

Education:  B.A. US Naval Academy (transferred from the University of Southern California). J.D. Georgetown University. 

Family: Married to Hong Le Webb (2005). Divorced from Jo Ann Krukar (1981-2004). Divorced from Barbara Samorajczyk (1968–1979).  

Claim to fame:  Webb is the rare Democrat who can bring both robust defense credentials and a history of genuine bipartisanship to the race. He served in Republican president Ronald Reagan's defense directorate as Navy secretary, and earned both the Navy Star and the Purple Heart in combat. Webb is also seen as a quiet scholar who has written more than a half-dozen historical novels and a critically acclaimed history of Scots-Irish U.S. immigrants. 

Achilles heel:  Webb has a reputation as a bit of a quitter. He resigned his Navy secretary post over a budget-cut dispute just 10 months after taking the job, and he declined to run for re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2006. He also attracted bad press for defending the use of the Confederate flag as a heritage symbol for American southerners. Amid a nationwide clamor to remove the flag from the South Carolina statehouse grounds, he wrote that Americans should 'respect the complicated history of the Civil War. ... Honorable Americans fought on both sides.' 
    
Hillary Clinton  Former sec. of state 

Age:  67 

Religion:  United Methodist  

Base: Liberals  

                            Résumé: Former secretary of state. Former U.S. senator from New York. Former U.S. first lady. Former Arkansas first lady. Former law school faculty, University of Arkansas Fayetteville. 

Education:  B.A. Wellesley College. J.D. Yale Law School. 

Family: Married to Bill Clinton (1975), the 42nd President of the United States. Their daughter Chelsea is married to investment banker Marc Mezvinsky, whose mother was a 1990s one-term Pennsylvania congresswoman. 

Claim to fame:  Clinton was the first US first lady with a postgraduate degree and presaged Obamacare with a failed attempt at health care reform in the 1990s. 

Achilles heel:  A long series of financial and ethical scandals has dogged Clinton, including recent allegations that her husband and their family foundation benefited financially from decisions she made as secretary of state. Her performance surrounding the 2012 terror attack on a State Department facility in Benghazi, Libya, has been catnip for conservative Republicans. And her presdiential campaign has been marked by an unwillingness to engage journalists, instead meeting with hand-picked groups of voters. 

  
 
Bernie Sanders*   Vermont senator 

Age:  73 

Religion:  Jewish 

Base:  Far-left progressives 

                              Résumé: U.S. senator. Former U.S. congressman. Former mayor of Burlington, VT. 

Education:  B.A. University of Chicago. 

Family: Married to Jane O'Meara Sanders (1988), a former president of Burlington College. He has one child from a previous relationship and is stepfather to three from Mrs. Sanders' previous marriage. His brother Larry is a Green Party politician in the UK and formerly served on the Oxfordshire County Council. 

Claim to fame:  Sanders is an unusually blunt, and unapologetic pol, happily promoting progressivism without hedging. He is also the longest-serving 'independent' member of Congress – neither Democrat nor Republican. 

Achilles heel:  Sanders describes himself as a 'democratic socialist.' At a time of huge GOP electoral gains, his far-left ideas don't poll well. He favors open borders, single-payer universal health insurance, and greater government control over media ownership. 

* Sanders is running as a Democrat but has no party affiliation in the Senate.

Prime Minister David Cameron will seek to reach a consensus on striking Islamic State militants in Syria despite the election of an anti-war leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party, his spokeswoman said on Monday. 

""The PM thinks there is a strong case for taking action against ISIL in Syria in the way that the UK is taking action against ISIL next door in Iraq,"" his spokeswoman said. 

""That remains his view. It hasn't changed because there has been a new leader of the opposition elected but, as he has said before, he wants to proceed with consensus on this matter and I think that is how he will continue to approach the issue."" 

Jeremy Corbyn, who Labour supporters elected as leader on Saturday, favours scrapping Britain's nuclear weapons and has said he would oppose any attempt to extend the mission in Syria.

Simon Le Bon thinks Lindsay Lohan is ''very special.'' 

The Duran Duran singer is ''really proud'' to have collaborated with the 'Mean Girls' actress on a track for the band's new album, 'Paper Gods,' even though he thinks she ''polarises people.'' 

The 56-year-old star said: ''I've known Lindsay for years and years and years. I met her in New York when we were both appearing on the Regis and Kelly show, believe it or not, so we stayed in contacted in a relaxed way. She texted me, and I said, 'Well, I'll try and find a slot for you.' And then 'Dancephobia' came up. We really needed something special for that little space in that song, and Lindsay delivered 100 percent. 

''It has brought a little controversy. She polarises people, Lindsay - doesn't she? She's very special. I'm really proud that we've got her on it.'' 

Simon was reluctant to collaborate with other artists in the past because it ''usually means that you let go of control of the vocals on the record.'' 

He told PEOPLE magazine: ''We've never had an album with so many guest stars. I've always really resisted collaborations, mainly because, as a singer, it's usually vocal collaborations, and I feel that I supposed you could say I've held onto the microphone quite jealously in the past decades.'' 

Meanwhile, the British musician isn't ''surprised in the slightest'' that One Direction have decided to take an extended hiatus next year. 

He explained: ''That is so normal. That was so predictable. It's the fact they work every bloody day. The pressure on them is so great, something had to break. I think it's a good decision.

Hanna Nixon, a one-time member of the Ryde Bellevue Players, used to tread the boards of Ryde and Shanklin theatres where she discovered her love for theatre.

When the former Ryde High School pupil turned 18, she hopped on a ferry and trained in theatre costume production at Manchester.

She progressed to performance and has since appeared around the UK and on the BBC.

When Hanna returns to Shanklin Theatre tonight, she will perform in the Spectacular Rat Pack Show — alongside Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr tribute acts.

Hanna said it has been a dream to return to the IW stage.

She said: ""Growing up on the Island provided me with people who have supported my career and encouraged my love of acting from an early age. Without the people I grew up with and learnt from, I would not be doing what I do today.""

efaa0efd-467e-4afb-8665-aad4b49ed8bb,"A criminal network involving a high-profile music promoter, a known crime figure and a Kings Cross solicitor was using Sydney's The Star and casinos in Las Vegas to launder millions of dollars from a cocaine syndicate, police will allege. A criminal network involving a high-profile music promoter, a known crime figure and a Kings Cross solicitor was using Sydney's The Star and casinos in Las Vegas to launder millions of dollars from a cocaine syndicate, police allege.

Music identity Andrew McManus, 54, crime figure Craig Haeusler, 55, and lawyer Michael Croke, 65, were among five men arrested in Australia and the US in connection with an alleged proposed importation of 300 kilograms of cocaine as well as money laundering.

Auburn pastry shop owner Zeki Atilgan, 32, was arrested and charged after a raid of his Kellyville home, while US businessman Owen Hanson jnr was arrested as he played golf in San Diego.

The international investigation was sparked in 2011 after the discovery of a black suitcase filled with $702,000 at Sydney's Hilton hotel.

Police revealed on Friday they will allege that the cash was the proceeds from a cocaine deal and that it was destined for The Star casino, to be laundered.

""The $702,000 was intended to go to a professional gambler who was working out of The Star casino,"" head of the Organised Crime Squad, Detective Superintendent Scott Cook, said.

""There's no suggestion the casino was complicit in any way with what the gambler was doing.

""The professional gambler was then taking the cheques from The Star casino to Las Vegas casinos and cashing the cheques in Las Vegas and that is how the money was being laundered.""

Superintendent Cook said police allege at least $5 million was laundered by the criminal network in this fashion.

He said the network came to the police's attention only in August 2011, when Sean Carolan, a Sydney-based former cage fighter and racehorse trainer-turned personal trainer, was found at the Hilton hotel in possession of the suitcase containing $702,000.

On the night police seized the cash, Mr Carolan said he was merely minding the money for Mr Hanson, his business partner, who didn't want to lose any more at the casino.

CCTV footage from The Star obtained by the police shows that, earlier in the day, Mr Carolan and Mr Hanson were in a heated conversation with Robert Cipriani, a well-known American high roller who calls himself Robin Hood 702 (702 is the telephone code for Las Vegas).

Police records note that Mr Cipriani ""is well known to the casino and is currently of interest to the Australian Federal Police"".

The day after the cash was seized, Mr Cipriani left for Los Angeles.

The money was confiscated, but Mr Carolan took action in the NSW Supreme Court to have it returned.

But, in extraordinary evidence tendered to the court, Mr McManus claimed ownership of the bag of cash.

""I gave someone 700 large, and you've found someone with 700 large. It's my 700 large,"" he told police in an interview with detectives in April 2012.

""It's not the proceeds of crime, it's the proceeds of Andrew McManus.""

He claimed the money was the proceeds from a Lenny Kravitz tour and he had used about 20 crew members to ""sneak"" the cash in from New Zealand.

""I'm not a dickhead but ... if this went to the ATO, I'd be cooked again,"" Mr McManus said to police at the time.

Mr McManus went on to say he was repaying Mr Hanson who had stumped up the deposit that Mr McManus needed for a ZZ Top tour and now he was paying him back.

Although he was accompanied to the police interview by his lawyer, Mr Croke, who was once his partner in a Sydney nightclub, Mr McManus continued to make extraordinary admissions.

He boasted to police that if they came round to his house ""right now"" they would find a safe with ""600 large sittin' in it"".

The Supreme Court ruled against Mr Carolan and the cash remains in the custody of NSW authorities.

Following Thursday's arrests, Mr McManus has been charged with perverting the course of justice, attempting to defraud by false or misleading statements and knowingly participating in a criminal group to assist crime.

He was released on bail on Thursday night and is due to appear in a Sydney court on October 14, a NSW Police spokeswoman said.

Mr Croke was charged with perverting the course of justice, three counts of intention to defraud by false or misleading statement, and knowingly participating in a criminal group.

Mr Haeusler has been charged with perverting the course of justice, intention to defraud by false or misleading statement, and knowingly participating in a criminal group.

Both Mr Croke and Mr Haeusler have been granted strict conditional bail and are due to appear at Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday, October 14.

A raid at Mr Atilgan's home allegedly resulted in the seizure of cash, steroids and cannabis. He was charged with two counts of money laundering.

Mr Carolan and Mr Cipriani have not been arrested.

Adelaide: Indian ace Pankaj Advani outplayed Peter Gilchrist of Singapore to win the World Billiards Championship in Adelaide on Sunday. 

This was Advani's 14th world title. 
 


Pankaj Advani   
 
Advani left the spectators spellbound with his prolific display as he downed his opponent by 1168 points after the match ended after the maximum allotted time of 300 minutes. 

Sunday victory also came as sweet revenge for Advani as he had lost the final of the point format championship to Gilchrist last week. 

Advani started the match on the front foot by smashing a break of 127 in his opening shot and took the game beyond his opponent in the next two shots by scoring two triple century breaks of 360 and 301. 

Advani then posted breaks of 284, 119, 101 and 106 to extend his lead to 1100 points at the halfway mark.

The Edmonton Oilers are taking a significant risk, but it’s one that could pay off nicely. 

Defenseman Oscar Klefbom has officially agreed to a seven-year contract extension, per the team’s website. That follows yesterday’s report that the two sides were close to reaching a deal of that length. 

The Oilers didn’t release the financial terms, but ESPN’s Craig Custance reported on Saturday that the contract would come with an annual cap hit of $4.167 million. 

That would make Klefbom’s deal comparable to the six-year, $25 million contract Adam Larsson signed in July. Both defensemen are 22 years old and were first round picks in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. 

In each case, the young blueliner is getting paid based more on his potential than past results. If the two defensemen develop as their respective teams hope, then those cap hits will look very good in a few years. However, Klefbom has only played in 77 NHL games so far, so the potential that this move could backfire is very real. 

Klefbom will join blueliner Andrej Sekera along with forwards Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Jordan Eberle, Taylor Hall, and Benoit Pouliot as Edmonton players signed through at least 2018-19. The six players come with a combined annual cap hit of roughly $31.7 million starting in 2016-17. 

Roughly a month and a half away from the 10-year anniversary of his first NHL game, Ryan Whitney announced that he’s decided to hang up his skates. 

“Today I am retiring from the game of hockey,” he said in a statement. “It’s impossible to put into words how much I love this sport. My mind has been flooded with so many amazing memories all day. From early morning rides to the rink with my dad, to having the privilege of representing my country in the Olympic Games, it truly has been a wonderful journey. 

“Unfortunately my body broke down on me sooner than I had hoped. I’m 32 years old and you’re likely to find stronger and more stable ankles and feet on the residents at your local nursing home. 

“I will miss my teammates and bring around the locker room the most. My best friends are guys I played this game with. I share so many different memories with all of them that span over 20 years. That is what makes hockey so special. 

“It is remarkable how quickly it went by. There were many ups and obviously plenty of downs, but I wouldn’t change a thing because it all made me into the person I am today. I dreamt of playing in the NHL my entire life and I’m forever thankful to everyone who helped make my dreams come true. 

” 

Whitney was taken with the fifth overall pick of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins and early in his career he was a great offensive defenseman. He tied sixth among blueliners in points with 59 in his 2006-07 sophomore season. He followed that up with a 40-point campaign in 2007-08, but that would be his last full season with the Penguins.

Military spokesman Colonel Sani Kukasheka Usman said the group was rescued as the army cleared Boko Haram camps on Monday in north-eastern Borno state. 

The army did not say where the women and children had been kidnapped from or give their condition. 



Hundreds of hostages have been freed from Boko Haram captivity this year but none of the 219 girls abducted in April 2014 from a school in Chibok was among those rescued. 

Nigeria’s homegrown Islamic extremist group has used dozens of girls and women in recent suicide bombings in Nigeria and neighbouring Chad, Cameroon and Niger, raising fears it is using kidnap victims. 

More than 1,000 people have been killed since President Muhammadu Buhari was elected in March with a pledge to annihilate the militants, whose six-year-old uprising has killed a total of about 20,000 people. 

At least 2.1m people have been driven from their homes, some across borders. 

Earlier this year, troops from Chad and Nigeria drove the extremists out of some 25 towns held for months in an area that Boko Haram had declared an Islamic caliphate aligned with the Islamic State group in the Middle East.

How can international nongovernmental organizations explain complex development issues — and the impact of their work in developing countries — in a way that can be easily understood by their supporters and donors? 

For U.S. filmmaker Josh Rothstein, documentaries can be an important medium for this. Through the length of time involved in the filmmaking process, documentaries allow for more time to investigate the message to communicate and how it should be told. 

“I think that the nature of documentary filmmaking, longer-form storytelling, is an important form and a very appropriate match for community development work and inherently with community development work there’s so much nuance,” Rothstein told Devex. “With shorter-form advertising, shorter-form spots or social media, you’re going to get an overview or you’re going get some sort of quick hits, but you’re not going to be able to fall into the storytelling component and ultimately get the sense that the audience would get.” 

And Dale Amtsberg, manager of   World Vision Australia ’s ambassador program, agrees. When the international NGO began a project to capture its work in Ethiopia five years ago, it tapped Rothstein and World Vision ambassadors Hugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness to help tell its story. The result was the documentary  “ Dukale’s Dream .” 

“The long-form format allows you to tell a more complex and nuanced story,” he told Devex. “You don’t have to speed up the narrative like you might for a TV commercial.” 
  
Filmmaking as a tool for social change 
 
Filmmaker Abigail Disney weighs in on the power of films to inspire people to act, how we can leverage technology to spur change, and what aspiring filmmakers skills can develop. 
  
“Dukale’s Dream” shows Jackman and Furness’ journey and understanding of the value of fair trade coffee, starting from the time they met a coffee farmer named Dukale. It set Jackman on a journey that led him to develop his own fair trade coffee brand, set up the Laughing Man Foundation and speak at the United Nations on behalf of Dukale and other coffee farmers like him. 

The film tracked the progress not just of Dukale but also the evolution of Laughing Man. 

“People have been very supportive,” Amtsberg said. “The film talks about the complexities of community development and fair trade, as well as the shifting paradigm of aid over the past 40 years. People have responded to the clear actions you can take to support the message of the film, such as buying fair trade coffee. Perhaps most interestingly, we have seen the film give existing supporters of World Vision a new understanding and energy for our work.” 
An outsider’s perspective 
World Vision believed it was important to give the filmmakers freedom to tell the story from the perspective of an outsider — the same as the audience they are targeting. 

“We wanted ‘Dukale’s Dream’ to be something different to what people expect from NGO communications,” Amtsberg said. 

Rothstein entered production with a limited understanding of the work World Vision did. 

“I’m not part of the NGO world so many of these concepts were brand new to me,” he said. “World Vision was receptive to that and I think ultimately they were fantastic partners in terms of our balance that we played throughout the entire film.” 

But, of course, the NGO has final say on the film. 

“World Vision is the executive producer of the film and owns all copyright,” Amtsberg told Devex. “We were involved throughout the production and post-production process and retained final cut approval. It was important we allowed the filmmakers the space to tell a compelling story but maintain the World Vision elements of the film.” 
Plan ‘end to end’ 
With documentaries there are, of course, the ups and downs of filming in remote localities and dedication involved in such a long journey. 

“Shooting, attempting to make a documentary of course in very rural parts of the planet are always very challenging,” Rothstein said. 

But despite challenges, it is a leap many NGOs might want to consider taking. 

“More and more, NGOs need to find compelling ways to tell the story of their work and reach new audiences,” Amtsberg told Devex, stressing the great potential for NGOs to expand their donor base. “There are more ways than ever for documentaries to find an audience — festivals, broadcast, video on demand, engaging existing supporters.” 

Internally within an NGO, planning five years ahead can be difficult with such a large-scale project. But Amtsberg said good planning will lead to success. 

“Plan it end to end before you start production,” he advised. “You need a release strategy from the start so you can tailor the film to suit your target audience. It can take significant internal resources for an NGO to produce a documentary, so you need to plan your return on investment from the outset.” 

But flexibility and an open mind are needed as well. 

“Hugh said, ‘You always have to keep open the window of opportunity to open it back up, to be receptive to the idea that there is a larger story and a more powerful message to communicate,’” Rothstein told Devex. “So, that’s both the most fantastic thing that you could have and want as a documentary filmmaker, but it’s also the most challenging because you have no control over the circumstances — it’s just the great unknown.”

(NASDAQ: MARA) (""Marathon""), a patent licensing company, announced today that on September 29, 2015, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (""PTAB"") of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (""USPTO"") denied a petition for inter partes review (""IPR""), IPR2015-01116, filed by Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. against Marathon subsidiary Signal IP, Inc.'s U.S. Patent No. 6,012,007 (""'007 Patent""). This was one of two IPR's filed against this patent. 

The PTAB ruled: ""... Petitioner's challenge to claim 1 is unpersuasive. Claim 17 is similar to claim 1, but recites ""a microprocessor...particularly programmed to"" perform the steps of the method of claim 1. Petitioner's contentions regarding claim 17 include the same deficiencies discussed above regarding claim 1. Pet. 26-27, 45-47. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that Petitioner has established a reasonable likelihood of success on its challenge to claims 1 and 17, or claims 19-21, which depend from claim 17, based on obviousness over Cashler and Schousek. For the foregoing reasons, we determine that the information presented in the Petition fails to establish a reasonable likelihood that Petitioner would prevail in establishing the unpatentability of any of the challenged claims..."" 

""We are pleased with the USPTO's decision denying Volkswagen's IPR petition, especially in light of their previous IPR against the '927 patent also being denied,"" said Doug Croxall, Founder and CEO of Marathon Patent Group. ""This ruling, along with those that have preceded it, continue to demonstrate the value of our proprietary process to assess, value, and acquire high quality patent assets that have the potential of generating meaningful return on investment for both the company and its shareholders."" 

The '007 patent is titled ""Occupant Detection Method and Apparatus for Air Bag System"" and issued on January 4, 2000 from U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/868,338 (""the '338 application""), filed June 3, 1997. The '007 patent relates to occupant restraints for vehicles and particularly to a method using seat sensors to determine seat occupancy for control of the deployment of supplemental inflatable restraints (SIRs) or vehicle airbags.

Footy Fever . Various artists. Canberra Contemporary Art Space, Gorman House Arts Centre, 55 Ainslie Avenue, Braddon, Until October 10. 

Footy Fever is an idiosyncratic exhibition that, according to the CCAS media release, ""seeks to represent the wildly varying connections that artists have with Aussie rules, rugby league, rugby union, soccer, and wheelchair rugby"". 

It is an ambitious premise and given that the exhibition also, purportedly, ""explores the way artists engage with the sport through themes of sexuality, belief, belonging, nostalgia, religion, war, dedication and fandom"" as well as declaring ""football's enduring relevance in the world of art"", a big ask of the curator. 

That said, the curator, Alexander Boynes, who has indeed asked these questions of himself, has delivered a compelling collection of 34 works dating from 1989 to 2015. 

The works, drawn from 15 artists, are said to hold connections with football in its various manifestations in an Australian context. Some of them manifestly do, and are loudly current, as, for example, Alex Asch's F--- the Haters (2015), a pertinent social and political statement – a certainly less potent aesthetic one. 

Boynes has attempted a wide sweep in the range of artists he has included in Footy Fever . Some, such as Meta Rothery –  Plugger 1 (1996) and Plugger 2 (1997) – despite her works having a quaintly naive attraction, have little claim to professional status in the art world. Others, notably Jon Cattapan –  Home Game 1. The Peanut Farm (2008) – hold serious national reputations. These selective extremes add to the overall visual interest of the exhibition while their inclusion reinforces the curator's idiosyncratic eclecticism. 

The aesthetic democracy mirrored in Boynes' choice of artists and accompanying works provides a number of ways for viewers to embrace (or not) his ambitious thematic thesis. There is a lot that is visually captivating that might seem to hold tenuous connections with the curator's professed theme. Other works clearly are concerned with football, at least in the imaginations of the artists who created them. 

Dinni Kunoth Kemarre​'s five wooden sculptures (all from 2008) of Indigenous football stars are compelling exemplars of the elision of contemporary Australian culture with traditional ways of representation. The possibilities of cultural coexistence are quietly played off against the overt racism articulated in Asch's F--- the Haters , a reference to the recent slurs thrown at Aboriginal footballer Adam Goodes. 

While Kemarre's works (and others – notably Glenn Morgan and Richard Lewer) clearly pictorialise aspects of (various) football codes (with accompanying interrogative ironies), others adopt art historical and cultural poses with essentially vestigial references to football and rather more to their own visual languages. 

Mariana Del Castillo's Confessions of a Footy Head (2015) is a characteristically clever and sophisticated work overlaid with subtle cultural allusions and a not too distant take on Salvador Dali's L'homme fleur . 

In her use of found and familiar objects Del Castillo is able to imbue her art with layered cultural reverberations that speak at once of her South American past, her Australian present and her acknowledgement and concomitant understanding of the value of art history and its ongoing pertinence in her practice. 

Her two pieces in Footy Fever reinforce for me the incisive aesthetic intelligence of this artist. Louise Paramor's Punters Club (2015) speaks of the poetry of the everyday. Her use of found objects offers a very different vision to that of Del Castillo. 

Paramor is interested in surface, in veneer, in referencing and commenting through her unique combinations the world of fashion, media and mass communications, and thus by connection the visualising of popular entertainment and here viz. football. Her almost surreal composite is both comment and question. 

One of the most conspicuous pieces in Footy Fever is David Spooner's esoterically lavish installation Electronic Football League (2007-ongoing). His teams of 12 players and four captains are suspended from the ceiling in a loosely circular configuration. 

Each player is constructed from fabric, stitched, knitted, quilted and stuffed. The manner of production essentially speaks of women's work and in that femininity subverts the assumed masculinity of the players. 

Spooner's suspended dolls ask in their material softness and in their carefully articulated but nevertheless unexplained physical relationships to one another, telling questions about gender and sexuality and society's expectations of these as operating in the world of football. 

More elemental questions are raised in Daniel Savage's The Rugby Creed (2015), a video and audio installation in MIDDLEspace. This is a poignant yet compellingly frank piece whose directness insists on viewer involvement. 

It is about the impact of disability on an individual's life (here, four individuals) and the liberation provided through participation in wheelchair rugby. Each of the protagonists individually verbalises a text (the same for each) that celebrates the intimate and symbiotic relationship between him and his wheelchair. 

Finally all four recite the text in unison. The gallery is darkened. The video of the four protagonists (almost life-size) occupies the wall opposite the entry. To the left of the entry a wheelchair sits, lightly illuminated, a mute commentator yet an essential and real partner to the images and voices on the wall. The Rugby Creed is a powerful inclusion, a serious foil to much of the rest of the work; its physical isolation an appropriate acknowledgment of its content and message. 

Footy Fever is an ambitious exhibition with a thematic premise difficult to deliver. Boynes has selected a diverse and engaging group of works to elucidate his thesis and his selection is both engaging and intelligent.

He explained that the MENAPAR Network aimed at bridging the existing gap in public administration research, which was in the past limited to countries of the Northern Hemisphere not the Southern, to developed, not developing countries. He commended the research provided by the MENAPAR Network which focuses on the public administration sector in the MENA region.

“I enjoy a girl who is kooky and sexy but strong and I like to put women across as individuals who have a sense of style and strength of their own,” she told the US online magazine The Ground, adding that she preferred stark to heightened glamour environments and loved the “desolate ‘70s vibe that you get in places like Las Vegas – and a good bit in Australia”. The 1970s vibe certainly comes across in these images with the flared trousers, hard edged black separates and in the languid and studiously offhand poses of the model. River Island keeps a budget conscious working female with a partygoing spirit in mind with such clothes and prices to match. Quite a number of designers in their London headquarters are Irish and every year the company operates an Irish bursary for a NCAD fashion graduate with a three-month internship. Some of their designs go into production; their design controller is Dubliner Lucy Moller, who won in 2006. This year’s winner was Adam Henderson from Rathgar, and recently the talented young photographer Conor Clinch, now dividing his time between London and Dublin, finished a stint with the company. His latest shoot was another 1970s one with Laura Whitmore for Hunger magazine.

Blame Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent for this pervasive 1970s mood in fashion and the current penchant for floppy hats, skin-tight leggings, biker jackets and sky high boots, tamed down from the catwalk for the high street by River Island and other high street brands. Stirred into this modern bohemian street style are 1960s miniskirts and bits of Victoriana, such fusion incorporating familiar details from the decades like fringing, whip stitching and lacing on necklines, skirts and jeans.

Given the sparkle everywhere this season, from the rhinestone studded slides at Prada to encrusted brocades at Simone Rocha, metallics in glitter lurex provide the necessary high octane evening glamour.

That in turn is a nod to Studio 54, famous for its four tons of glitter dumped on the floor for a party in the 1970s. Shaggy furs, quirky tights and peep toed boots provide the requisite fun elements and colours such as mustard, red, grey and khaki match the graphic background set.","Fashion: this season, it’s a 70s thing",News,Irish Times,2015-09-05T04:00:32Z

The beach’s entrance displays a sign which reads “keep out” and explains that the area has been found to be “dangerous for swimming and walking.” 

The town council closed down the beach on Monday (August 31), following the results of several technical studies which considered the area dangerous due to the several homes in ruins, the poor condition of the pavements and the existence of several ripraps – makeshift breakwaters - made up with huge stones which were placed there illegally to protect homes next to the sea. 

Local people have voiced their complaints as they claim closing down the beach is not the solution and have called for a complete redevelopment project. 

Moments of tension were felt on Monday as many neighbours refused to have fences used to close up the area attached to their façades. 

On behalf of the town council, Beach Councillor Ana Martinez said that the decision had been taken to maintain safety in beach areas.

Joseph Kahn said the video includes black people and was produced by a black woman and edited by a black man. 
 [embedded content] 
“This is not a video about colonialism but a love story on the set of a period film crew in Africa, 1950,” Kahn said in a statement. 
 
“There are black Africans in the video in a number of shots, but I rarely cut to crew faces outside of the director as the vast majority of screentime is Taylor and (actor) Scott (Eastwood).” 
 
Kahn, who directed Taylor’s Blank Space and Bad Blood, is Asian. 
 
Wildest Dreams portrays Taylor as an actress who falls in love with her co-star on the set. Black actors are seen in some of the clips from a distance. 
 
“The reality is not only were there people of colour in the video, but the key creatives who worked on this video are people of colour … We cast and edited this video. We collectively decided it would have been historically inaccurate to load the crew with more black actors as the video would have been accused of rewriting history,” Kahn said.

5684ded2-5b90-414b-8a78-4b87d2441d98,"Kenilworth motorists have been advised that roads will be “exceptionally busy” on Sunday September 27 due to the forthcoming horse fair taking place in Kenilworth at the weekend. 

		 
Although major roadworks on Coventry Road that have lasted over two months are expected to be completed on Friday September 25, the disruption for drivers will continue because of the large numbers of people descending on Thickthorn Farm from Thursday September 24 to Sunday September 27, which is likely to be the busiest day. 

Peter Cutts, Safer Communities Manager at Warwick District Council said: “A Traffic Management Plan will be in place on Sunday, which will involve controlling traffic from the Thickthorn roundabout all the way down to the St Johns roundabout, which is what we’ve had in place for the last four horse fairs. 

			 
“Traditionally this event is quieter than April but busier than July. 



 
“We anticipate that the sewerage works on the Coventry Road will be completed on Friday but residents should try and avoid the roads to and from Thickthorn if at all possible.” 

Although the forthcoming horse fair tends to attract more people than July’s, the disruption should not be as bad as it was back then as the previous horse fair coincided with the start of the sewer improvements. 

Motorists and public transport users had been facing significant delays to journey times after a 250-metre stretch of Coventry Road was closed in order for Severn Trent Water to install new sewer pipes designed to prevent sewer flooding, which had caused serious problems for the area in the past. 

Before the start of the improvement works, Severn Trent Water’s communications manager, Paul Evans, said: “We’ll be replacing existing sewer pipes with larger ones to help prevent local properties from suffering from sewer flooding. 

			 
“The sewers in the area are no longer able to cope during heavy rainfall, and, in the past when we’ve had a lot of rain, sewage has backed up through pipes and flooded into homes and gardens. 

“This is unacceptable and it’s our job to stop it which is why it’s so important to do this work.” 

The plans were first mooted in January 2015, but were pushed back until July by Warwickshire County Council in order to avoid adding to disruption from major roadworks that were taking place along Gibbet Hill and up to the University of Warwick. 

The work on Coventry Road was then expected to start on July 13, but this was again pushed back for a further week because of other unfinished roadworks in Whitely. 

			 
When the work started, there was a lengthy diversion in place which ran along New Street, Bridge Street, Priory Road, Waverley Road, Warwick Road, St Johns, Leamington Road, Kenilworth Bypass and the Stonebridge Highway. 

The main bulk of the roadworks has been completed as Severn Trent Water has now finished installing the new sewer pipes, and all that remains is for the council to resurface the road, if they have not already done so by Friday.

Aleem Sunanon kicked a 46-yard field goal to force overtime and Xavier Johnson scored from 2 yards out on Saturday to give South Alabama perhaps the biggest victory in the program's history, a 34-27 comeback win over San Diego State at Qualcomm Stadium.

A Jaguar offense that has lived off big plays this season leaned on them again to rally from a 17-3 first half deficit. Cody Clements, who completed 18 of 35 passes for 270 yards and two scores, hit Josh Magee with a 46-yard scoring strike just before halftime, Johnson scored on a 74-yard third-quarter run, and Clements later found Gerald Everett for a 57-yard score and a 24-20 fourth-quarter lead.

The Aztecs (1-2), 17½-point favorites entering the game, reclaimed a 27-24 lead on an 8-yard run by Donnel Pumphrey, but Clements guided the Jaguars (2-1) from their own 29 to the San Diego State 29 and Sunanon, who suffered his first miss in 13 attempts earlier in the game, was good from 46 to force overtime.

Clements connected with Everett again for 15 yards to set up Johnson's 2-yard TD run in overtime, and the Jaguar defense held San Diego State on four plays to seal the victory.

Johnson finished with 142 yards and two scores on 19 carries as South Alabama, which managed just 19 yards on the ground in last week's 48-9 loss to Nebraska, ran for 241 yards as a team and piled up 511 yards of total offense. Everett had eight catches for 164 yards and the score. Pumphrey ran for 102 yards and the score on 28 carries, but the Aztecs had just 140 yards rushing in all.

07ff6a4d-2b83-46af-864c-c16ed5b0ca87,"Also featured: Pieces from collection of Lupita Tovar, silent film star and matriarch of Hollywood dynasty; other noted collectors  
BOULDER, CO – Artemis Gallery will launch its busy fall auction season with a Thursday, Sept. 24 online auction led by Part II of the late James Caswell’s collection. Caswell was an artist, National Endowment for the Arts Fellow and respected owner of Historia Antiques in Santa Monica, California. The entire Caswell estate consignment, which comprises approximately 40 to 50 percent of Artemis Gallery’s Ancient, Ethnographic and Spanish Colonial Auction inventory, is cataloged with estimates at or below cost. 
  
“This sale will be an outstanding buying opportunity for dealers and collectors alike,” said Teresa Dodge, managing director of Artemis Gallery. “Rarely do we see material of this caliber ‘priced to sell.’ And due to popular demand, we’re making our Marketplace section of more-affordable items the ‘closer’ in this and all future sales. Collectors love it.” 
  
Several other high-quality collections are represented in the 400-lot event, most notably that of Mexican-born silent film star Lupita Tovar. The pieces acquired by Ms. Tovar have remained on display in her Bel Air mansion for many years. 
  
The auction is broad in scope and contains ancient and ethnographic art from the Americas to Southeast Asia. One of the top highlights is Lot 17, a stunning 31-inch Greek transport amphora, circa 3rd to 2nd century BCE, with provenance from the William Dale collection. Mr. Dale was a lifelong US diplomat who amassed a sizable antiquities collection while posted in the Near East. He brought his collection home to America in 1964. The amphora is estimated at $7,000-$9,000 and, like all items in the auction, is guaranteed authentic, exactly as described in the catalog, and legal to buy/sell under the US statute covering cultural patrimony. Each lot sold will transfer to the new owner with a certificate of authenticity from Artemis Gallery. 
  
Another great prize is Lot 48, a 2,500-year-old Chinese Warring States bronze axle cap that dates to circa 475-221 BCE. Originally part of a cart or chariot, the vase-form piece is decorated in low relief with sinewy dragons in a cloudy sky. Additional decorative work appears on six triangular panels. Formerly in a Pasadena, California collection, it is expected to make $4,000-$5,000 at auction. 
  
“There are so many important items in James Caswell’s collection, it’s difficult to choose even a few that merit special mention, but some of his silver is remarkable,” said Dodge. Lot 180, a circa-1800 Mexican coconut shell chalice fitted with a silver ormolu stem, rim and base is carved with sophisticated sgraffito of a type associated with itinerant traders and sailors of that period. The 8-inch-tall chalice is estimated at $2,500-$3,000. 
  
An exceptional sterling silver Spanish Colonial-style crown made by Andean silversmiths in Bolivia, circa late-19th to early 20th century, was hand-hammered and expertly molded in repousse, then chased throughout. The wonderfully decorated crown with a cross-shape finial weighs 8.5 ounces and measures 6 by 7 inches. It was likely intended for a santo figure. Also from the Historia Antiques/James Caswell collection, the crown is estimated at $900-$1,200. 
  
The Caswell collection boasts many fine Latin American retablos, including Lot 169, an artist-signed (Ignacio Munoz) and dated (1868) depiction of Mater Dolorosa, a popular subject venerating the Virgin Mary. Polychrome painted primarily in blues and greens, and measuring 14 by 10 inches, it is modestly estimated at $1,500-$1,800. 
  
A wealth of Mayan and other Pre-Columbian artifacts from Jalisco, Chancy and Casas Grandes, Ramos, etc., will be offered. From the Lupita Tovar collection comes Lot 79, a 13-inch Colima (Western Mexico) redware dog effigy with handsome manganese blooms and burnishing marks. Its endearing expression, almond-shape eyes and open, toothy mouth sets this pudgy pooch apart from other Colima dogs. It could reach a high bid of $1,500-$3,000. 
  
“Anyone with a passion for antiquities, ethnographic art or Pre-Columbian art should make a point to browse through the catalog very carefully,” said Dodge. “It’s not every day that pieces with important provenance come to the market with such affordable estimates. Some of the great, early collectors with Hollywood money to burn once owned items in this sale, including the late Edward G. Robinson, who was one of the most supremely knowledgeable art buyers of his time.” 
  
Bidders may participate in Artemis Gallery’s Thursday, Sept. 24, 2015 auction live online, by phone (please reserve phone line in advance) or by leaving an absentee bid that will be lodged confidentially and competitively on their behalf. The sale will begin at 11 a.m. Eastern Time and will be conducted simultaneously on three bidding platforms: ArtemisGalleryLIVE.com, LiveAuctioneers.com and Invaluable.com.

The Richmond Fed, which also includes the cities of Charlotte and Baltimore, gave further indication that the factory sector is experiencing a sizable dip going into the back half of the year, as the headline business conditions reading came in at -5 for September compared to the 0 reading in August and well below consensus' expectation for 3. More discouraging is the steep reversal in the 3-month moving average, which is fast approaching negative territory. 
 
Though the Philly Fed managed to hang tough on new orders, such was not the case in Richmond as new orders dropped even further in the negative column to a reading of -12 and points at continued weakness in the coming months. Shipments are also in negative territory for a second consecutive month at -3. Additionally, manufacturers in the Richmond region have managed to work down their backlogs in order to match production, which resulted in backlog orders staying deep in contractionary territory with readings of -24 and -15 in the last two months.

THOUSANDS of parents are being urged to complete their application forms on time if they want their children to get into popular secondary schools. 

It comes as the main admissions round has been launched for pupils who are due to transfer to high school in autumn 2016. 

Over the next few weeks, schools are planning open evenings to give families an insight into what they have to offer. 

Parents have until October 31 to select up to three preferred schools and submit the applications to their local authority. Most people now fill in these forms online. 
 
In Staffordshire, around 7,400 pupils will be transferring to Year 7 next September. 

While in Stoke-on-Trent, 2,500 students will be starting secondary education. And in Cheshire East, about 3,500 youngsters are preparing to make the big leap. 

This year, more than nine out of 10 parents across the area managed to get their children into their top-choice school. 

Yet there were still dozens of appeals, with relatively few ruling in the parents' favour. 

Paul Gerrard, strategic manager for school support at Stoke-on-Trent City Council, today advised people to make sure they met the applications deadline to stand the best chance of success. 

He said: ""The more popular the school, the more late applications become an issue. Although we try to accommodate people, we can't always meet late requirements."" 

The biggest pressure has been on the city's primaries, with thousands of extra places created in recent years to cope with the knock-on effects of rising birth rates. 

But Paul added: ""That primary bulge is now working its way through. We're expecting demand to start increasing for secondary applications."" 

In Stoke-on-Trent, selective St Joseph's College, in Trent Vale, proved the biggest draw for families this year. 

And Ormiston Sir Stanley Matthews Academy, in Blurton, saw 322 parents name it as their first choice, despite having only 250 places. 

The most popular Staffordshire school this year was Clayton Hall Academy, in Clayton, which had to turn dozens of potential pupils away. 

Other oversubscribed schools included Wolstanton High, Blythe Bridge High, Moorside High, in Werrington, and Endon High. 

Councillor Ben Adams, cabinet member for learning and skills at Staffordshire County Council, today cautioned families not to put 'all their eggs in one basket'. 

He said: ""We would encourage them to put down three choices. 

""Another tip is to go to the open evenings. That's really important because you can see if a school feels right for your child. 

""Get as much information as possible before you make up your mind."" 

It is not just 11-year-olds who will be considering their study options. 

A growing number of specialist schools are being launched, which take students from the age of 14. 

They include The JCB Academy, in Rocester, where all teenagers study engineering and work with local companies on practical challenges. 

Another university technical college operating along similar lines will be opening in Crewe in September 2016. It is now recruiting for its first intake. 

Then there is Stoke Studio College, which caters for young people wanting to study construction or engineering-related courses. 

Families applying for primary places have until the end of January to make their choices.",Rush is on for secondary school places,News,The Sentinel,2015-09-15T18:39:41Z
24f4879c-4016-4521-9072-80d0affb340b,"SALE, Morocco, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Moroccan authorities said on Monday they had dismantled a militant cell planning to create an Islamic State affiliate, seizing weapons and bomb-making materials in raids on their hideouts.

The cell is the latest in a series of radical groups Morocco says it has uncovered. The group was operating in the southern city of Essaouira and the central town of Sidi Allal Al-Bahraoui.

At the offices of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), reporters were shown weapons, ammunition, tasers, swords and bomb materials seized from hideouts. BCIJ is the judicial part of the Moroccan domestic intelligence service.

The five members of the group had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, and planned to create a local offshoot, called the Caliphate Soldiers in Morocco, bureau head Abdelhak Khayyam said.

The group's name is inspired from the Algerian group of the Caliphate Soldiers, an al Qaeda splinter faction that had declared allegiance to ISIS last year before kidnapping and beheading a French tourist.

""The weapons came to Morocco through the eastern borders with Algeria,"" Khayyam said.

Hundreds of fighters from Morocco and other Maghreb states like Tunisia and Algeria have joined Islamist militant forces in Syria's war. Some are threatening to return and create a new jihadi wings in their home countries, security experts say.

Five members of the latest cell were planning to leave to Syria and Iraq after perpetrating an attack, authorities said.

Morocco, a Western ally against Islamist militancy, often announces it has broken up radical cells accused of plotting attacks. It has suffered many bomb attacks by Islamist miltants, most recently in 2011 in Marrakesh.

DALLAS 

New research from AT&T (NYSE: T) shows how we can influence our closest contacts. And tagging these people on social may be the perfect way to get their attention. 

We're encouraging the public to pledge to keep their eyes on the road, not their phones. And today we released new research showing how our voices can make a difference. What we found was surprising! 

While many of us have hundreds of smartphone contacts, 2-in-3 people have almost all or most of their smartphone communications1 with just 5 people. The research also showed that people and their ""top 5"" have a lot of influence over each other.

We're in the fifth year of the It Can Wait campaign, so new research like this is important to us as we continue to advance the program to curb the dangerous practice of smartphone distracted driving. More than 9-in-10 respondents believe it's dangerous for drivers to send and receive smartphone communications from behind the wheel. The research shows they're missing a real opportunity to help keep their ""top 5"" safe:

Another interesting angle is that our ""top 5"" are people we know so well that we often know when they're driving. Yet 4-in-10 surveyed said they rarely or never consider whether or not someone else is driving when they communicate with them.

We're sharing these research results with a request. Use the influence you have with those closest to you to help keep each other safe.

Earlier this year we reported that nearly 4-in-10 use social media when they're driving. So we're asking you to tag your ""top 5,"" whether it's a best friend or co-worker, in a social post encouraging them to keep their eyes on the road, not on their phone. It takes just a few seconds, and we're calling it #Tag5toSave5. This quick post could make a big difference in the lives of your favorite people! 

No post, glance, email, search or text is worth a life … It Can Wait. 

1 ""Smartphone use/communications"" refers to texts, social media interactions, mobile messaging applications and emails, but not talking on one's phone.

IRVINE, Calif. , Sept. 25, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --  New-vehicle sales are expected to increase 12 percent year-over-year to a total of 1.39 million units in September 2015 , resulting in an estimated 17.5 million seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR), according to Kelley Blue Book www.kbb.com , the only vehicle valuation and information source trusted and relied upon by both consumers and the automotive industry.  At 1.39 million units this will be the highest September sales volume since 2006. 

Expect big increases across the industry in September, with the average gains from manufacturers in the double digits.  Including Labor Day sales with September totals this year is one reason for the big jump, but the underlying demand for new vehicles remains strong.  With the average age of vehicles on the road increasing, used-car prices on the rise and financing still inexpensive, it looks like new-car sales will continue to increase in the near future. 

""While the Volkswagen scandal will have a negative impact on sales, the affected models represent less than a quarter of their portfolio, and some dealers have already depleted their stock of those units,"" said Alec Gutierrez , senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book.  ""The larger issue is the hit the automaker's brand image and perceived trustworthiness, which may affect sales of their other models. We think the effects on September sales won't be too bad for Volkswagen Group's combined sales, but October and beyond could be another story."" 

Key Highlights for Estimated September 2015 Sales Forecast: 

Ford Motor Company Continues Gains on Truck, Van Segments; Korean Brand Strength Attributed to Fleet Sales 

Ford Motor Company should have another solid month of growth, with gains coming from the truck and van segments.  The Ford Transit van is proving to be a success in the U.S., pushing the brand's van volume up 27 percent this year.  

In addition, Hyundai and Kia could see some major sales improvements, with projected growth of 18 percent from this time last year, despite having product portfolios leaning heavily toward the declining car segment.  However, some of the strength is attributed to the rise in the automaker's fleet sales, which are up 24 percent for the year.

Compact Utility Continues Streak as Most Popular Segment; Trucks Climb on F-150 Availability 
For the second month in a row, the compact utility segment will be the most popular.  In September, sales in this segment have flourished as U.S. gas prices approach the low $2 range nationally, and year-to-date sales are up 14 percent. 

""September also should be a strong month for truck sales, fueled by the low gas prices and the increased availability of the aluminum-bodied F-150,"" said Gutierrez.  ""The F-Series hit 70,000 units in August for the first time this year, and should show continued improvement this month.""

9e1743be-ccc6-47a9-a08b-beb703eeffef,"Well, here we are again, gentle readers, me writing to you about this week’s subject matter, the weatherman, slash, weathergirl. 

It is the 14th day of September and the weather gal says 94 degrees for this day. I had to take the Harley into Fort Collins, some 28 miles away for an oil change and new headlamp. It was cool enough for me to wear a leather coat. The mornings have been pretty cool with just a slight touch of fall in the air for the past two or three weeks. If you remember, we had such a late, late, spring with lots of rain and cool, cool days. It seemed to go on forever. The result was lots and lots of grass which is still here even with more and larger cattle added to the place for summer grazing. That’s a good thing. 

The bad thing is that it has been hot and dry for weeks now, at least here at the ONO. As a result, when I was headed into Fort Collins Saturday evening late, there was a huge fire coming across the prairie from the northeast. It appears as if some moron threw out a smoke on the interstate in a high wind. 

I have some neighbors in that area that never bothered to mow one blade of grass or cut their weeds this summer. Some of them have tall weeds and grass right up to their doorstep. Same with their corrals and plus all of that, they have hay stacked everywhere. I gotta’ tell ya Charlie Brown, I don’t get that kind of thinking. You put not only yourself at risk but all of your livestock and property. If that fire had gotten within 50 yards of their domain, it wouldn’t be standing this morning, I guarantee you! 

Let me go back to the weather person, I’ll be politically correct here. I really don’t remember when I saw my first weather gal on the telly. Was it in the late 1980s or up into the ‘90s. I just don’t remember my first time. I’m pretty sure she was attractive. A weather gal has to be pretty and most of them are very fit and I’ve noticed lately that most have large chest, if you will. Why would I notice that instead of the weather? I reckon it’s a man thing. Don’t get me wrong I didn’t mean to insinuate that these gals are using their “good lookingness” to divert some of us away from what the weather is actually going to do. Not at all. I have found that most of the time these gals are very skillful and present the weather in a professional and timely manner and they are 90 percent right most of the time. Occasionally the weather man is a handsome figure of a man, but not always. That most generally falls on the news anchor man to be double agent 007 and his counterpart is “almost Miss America” and they make a striking couple.

Paris (AFP) | 21 September 2015 15:51 

Some 262 million tonnes of garbage — more than double the national estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of 122 million tonnes — was dumped in landfills that year, scientists wrote in the journal Nature Climate Change. 
 
This suggested that methane emissions from the decomposition of municipal waste at these dumps were also undercounted. 
 
The trio of US-based environmental scientists examined data gathered under domestic regulations requiring landfills to report on the volume of rubbish dumped and gas collected at landfills. 
 
They used a different methodology than the EPA, and claimed their estimate was the “most accurate for the US so far”. 
 
Landfills, they wrote, represent the third-largest, man-made source of methane in the United States — about 18 percent of domestic emissions. 
 
Methane lives for a shorter time in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG), but traps far more of the heat radiated from Earth’s surface. 
 
Capture and combustion of landfill gas (LFG), is a crucial part of the national strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
About 91 percent of landfill emissions in the United States in 2012 came from open dumps still actively accepting new waste — much less efficient at capturing gas than sites which had already been covered up, said the team. 
 
They also calculated that the average rate of landfill waste disposal was increasing at a rate of about 0.3 percent per year. 
 
– Vicious circle – 
   Landfills represent the third-largest man-made source of methane in the United States — about 18 percent of domestic emissions, scientists wrote in the journal Nature Climate Change | © AFP/File | Don Emmert   
“These results demonstrate the clear need to target open landfills to achieve significant near-term methane emission reductions,” wrote the team. 
 
In lower- and lower-middle-income developing nations, waste generation is expected to increase by 185 percent and 158 percent respectively by 2025, they added. 
 
And an underestimate in the United States raised the spectre of similar miscalculations in the rest of the world. 
 
“A high reliance on landfilling has been observed in the EU (European Union) and in developing nations, similar to the US,” wrote the researchers. 
 
“Improving the collection of LFG at open landfills, must be a target for policymakers, researchers and practitioners to achieve near-term GHG emission reductions in the waste sector.” 
 
In a separate study published by the same journal, researchers said greenhouse gas emissions from thawing Arctic permafrost may result in an additional $43 trillion (38 trillion euros) in costs by the year 2200. 
 
A team used computer models to make a long-term forecast of the impacts of climate change, and the cost of measures to abate and adapt to it. 
 
Permafrost — perennially frozen ground covering about a quarter of exposed land in the northern hemisphere — contains an estimated 1.7 trillion tonnes of carbon in the form of frozen organic matter, which releases carbon dioxide and methane as it decomposes. 
 
As the planet warms, more permafrost thaws to release more greenhouse gases, thus feeding into a vicious climate circle.

The record books will be re-written today as Queen Elizabeth II becomes Britain’s longest serving monarch.

Her Majesty overtakes Queen Victoria’s 23,226 days on Wednesday, September 9, 2015.

A descendant of the House of Windsor, the young Elizabeth ascended the throne at the age of 25 after a dramatic turn of events that began in the mid-1930s.

King Edward VIII, her uncle, abdicated to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

Following the abdication, Elizabeth’s father, George VI, became king.

In 1952, while in Kenya with her husband Prince Philip, Elizabeth learned her father had died from lung cancer.

Elizabeth’s five-month tour, scheduled to take in Australia and New Zealand, was abruptly cancelled and the grieving woman flew back to London, her life forever changed.

No one could have imagined 63 years, seven months and two days after being crowned she would still be on the throne serving 139 million constituents in the UK and 15 Commonwealth countries.

Since her coronation in 1953, Queen Elizabeth II has visited Australia 16 times and is the first reigning monarch to set foot on Australian soil.

The 1954 Royal Tour took her to more than 60 towns and cities in 60 days.

Around regional NSW crowds turned out in droves, with an estimated 50,000 standing in torrential rain in Lismore waiting for Her Majesty to arrive at the local council chambers.

At the Melbourne Cricket Ground she was welcomed by 70,000 ex-servicemen and women.

During her 1963 visit, the Queen made a broadcast to people in remote communities over the Royal Flying Doctor Service network in Alice Springs.

The Queen has presided at the official opening of the Sydney Opera House in 1973; the Australian Stockman’s Hall of Fame in Longreach in 1988; the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000; and the new Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne in 2011, where she met conjoined twins Trishna and Krishna separated in a 27-hour operation in 2009.

In her Jubilee year in 1977 the Queen visited every Australian state during a three-week tour.

At the end of her 1954 tour the then Prime Minister Robert Menzies wrote in an article in Fairfax’s Sydney Morning Herald:

""It is a basic truth that for our Queen we have within us, sometimes unrealised until the moment of expression, the most profound and passionate feelings of loyalty and devotion.

“It does not require much imagination to realise that when eight million people spontaneously pour out this feeling they are engaging in a great act of common allegiance and common joy which brings them closer together.”

Several months after Her Majesty left Australia in 1954, an editorial appeared in Fairfax’s Muswellbrook Chronicle, dated June 8, 1954.

It was entitled, ‘A Queen’s Lead,’ and reported on the monarch’s impact during that Royal Tour of 1954 stating, in part:

“Her Majesty has become something personal to us. She is not now a distant figure, a symbol; she is a warm, human, living figure.”

The Queen’s reign has not been without blemish and she has made mistakes, among them her failure to anticipate the emotional impact of the death of Diana.

But whatever your thoughts may be on this day, be you Republican or Monarchist, it must be said this woman, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, has fulfilled her Coronation Oath and done so with a devotion to duty unlikely to be seen again.

b78d89b2-358c-4d75-a8b4-9436c0eb5cfc,"PETALING JAYA: For the past month, there has been a steady stream of news of millions of people in Southeast Asia suffering from haze due to the peat fires in Indonesia.  
 
There have been criticisms of the Indonesian government despite the authorities’ water-bombing and cloud seeding efforts to beat the peat fire. 
 
The ongoing El Nino phenomenon is exacerbating the problem, creating conditions that fan the smouldering flames. 
 
More than 5,000 Indonesian personnel, including the military and police, have been working tirelessly and round the clock to get residents access to medical help. 
 
Aircraft continue to water-bomb hotspots and “cloud seed” the skies to induce rain. 
 
Air quality index readings have been as high as 1,992 in Palang-karaya, Central Kalimantan — anything over 200 is unhealthy — while the numbers are fluctuating between unhealthy and very unhealthy in Singapore and Malaysia, depending on wind conditions. 
 
Indonesian President Joko Widodo declared a state of emergency in Riau province, one of the worst affected areas. He has also gone down to the ground with emergency workers to help fight the fire in Banjarbaru,  South Kalimantan, before heading to Sumatra where he inspected  conditions and fire-fighting efforts in Jambi.  
 
The Indonesian Palm Oil Association, or Gabungan Pengusaha Kelapa Sawit Indonesia (Gapki), too, had been responding positively, with its member companies mobilising fire-fighting units to help put out the fires. 
 
But, like the years before, it said such positive efforts often went unnoticed as the truth was not sexy when  pitted against damning allegations. 
 
Inevitably, those who are more skilful at spreading rumours  and attracting media attention continue  to influence public perception, it added. 
 
“Members of Gapki have been conscientiously implementing good agricultural practices. We are committed to a zero burning policy. This means no slash-and-burn to clear land for new plantings or re-plantings,” Gapki chairman Joko Supriyono told Antara News earlier this week. 
 
He said slash and burn assumptions thrown at estate owners did not make sense.  
 
“Why would companies that have invested trillions of rupiah  want to risk  having their permits revoked just because they want to save the cost of land clearing?” he questioned. 
 
In an interview with Business Times, here, 
recently, Incorporated Society of Planters chairman Daud Amatzin concurred that misunderstandings and wrongful blaming continue to recur because the communication of facts and figures on the differences between a well-managed peatland and one that is not is very much lacking.  
 
When asked to comment on the spate of media reports on peat fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan, Daud said “there has to be more public awareness of this topic because decision makers need to be able to differentiate facts from mistaken assumptions about peat soil and peat fire”. 
 
“Oil palm planters who carry out proper peatland development and water management at their estates should be given a pat on the back for preventing the spread of peat fire. Instead, what we see is a stab in the back of planters. Such false allegations are sinful,” he said.  
 
“Do you know that professional planters practising modern agriculture invest a lot of money in heavy machinery to clear the land, compact the peat soil and dig up a maze of trenches?  
 
“This is to compress the peat soil and keep it moist so that the oil palms can grow properly. Incidentally, this process makes the soil less flammable and retards fire from spreading underground,” he said. 
 
Most of the oil palm estates in Riau are matured and bearing fruits. 
 
“So, why would planters want to set fire and destroy their oil palms?” asked Daud, adding that the maze of water-filled trenches in peat area doubled up as both  transportation routes and fire barriers in estates. 
 
Asked on the satellite pictures showing many hotspots across Sumatra and Kalimantan as indicating fiery blaze within plantation concessions, Daud replied: “We must take note that in Indonesia, 20 per cent of the landbank is under the plasma scheme, of which smallholders occupy scattered enclaves within the estates”. 
 
He said one must not discount the possibility that haze-causing fires could have been started by the local communities for shifting cultivation of cash crops in these enclaves. 
 
Peatland is highly flammable in drought conditions, if not properly managed. Many cash-crop farmers, who cannot afford heavy machinery for land clearing, may have been unknowingly torching up peatland and  setting off fires that smoulder underground for weeks and months. 
 
Daud explained that fire spreads underground easily when peat soil is dry and spongy in the forest and shifting cultivation area. On the other hand, peat that has been compressed by heavy machinery and moisturised in water-filled trenches actually prevents spread of smouldering underground fire. 
 
“When peat fire occurs, it does not recognise geographical boundaries. The fact that environmental activists and politicians are quick to blame planters without any evidence of where and how the fire originated shows these allegations are not factual,” Daud said.",Planters under fire over haze,News,New Straits Times,2015-09-26T02:06:27Z

Esau Kioni, who served in former President Mwai Kibaki's administration, asked IG Joseph Boinnet to let the NYS train youths to man traffic, thereby creating jobs.

""Today the traffic department is on an extortion spree,"" Kioni told journalists in Othaya town on Saturday.

""The work of manning traffic can even be done by county askaris. Let that department be abolished and the officers taken to other police work in order to address the shortage of officers in the country.""

Kioni cited accidents saying officer at police stations near the scenes can take over investigations and prosecution.

He said a book on traffic laws, including instant fining for minor offenses, should be created, and added that patrol cars should be introduced along roads.

""The fines should not exceed Sh3,000. Though this, the government will collect a lot of revenue, curb corruption and ensure motorists don't waste time through judicial processes,"" he said.

Mutunga said the Judiciary had identified the refund of bail money as one of the major handicaps in the justice system.

He directed judiciary administrators to work on a bail refund mechanism that would eliminate administrative impediments in the refund processes.

The guidlines included traffic courts processing the payment of traffic fines in an open court and ensuring adequate facilities are accorded to the payment of ines and bail.

The directives also stated that no accused persons in traffic cases would be locked up without being adequately enabled to pay the bails or fines.

The pontiff said he will allow priests ""discretion to absolve of the sin of abortion those who have procured it and who, with contrite heart, seek forgiveness for it"" during the holy year beginning December 8.

""I am well aware of the pressure that has led [women] to this decision. I know that it is an existential and moral ordeal,"" Francis added.

Selling a few sneaky bottles of wine after 10pm has cost a Sydney bottle shop more than $28,000 in fines. 

A Darling Harbour bottleshop is the first business to be prosecuted for breaching new drinking laws that ban the sale of takeaway alcohol after 10pm. 

It comes as the state government conducts a review of the 10pm takeaways sales ban which was introduced last year as part of measures to combat alcohol-related violence following the deaths of teenagers Thomas Kelly and Daniel Christie. 

Undercover officers caught Harbourside Cellars selling wine to customers and were able to buy alcohol themselves during a two-week operation in January and February this year. 

On Monday, a court found Xia Zhang had illegally sold alcohol on five occasions and failed to produce financial records. 

Ms Zhang pleaded guilty and was convicted of six offences and ordered to pay $2500 for each illegal sale and $5500 for failing to produce records. 

The licensee was also ordered to pay legal costs of $7,878. The combined amount for the penalties was $28,378. 

Police have also issued three on-the-spot fines of $1100 to other bottle shops since the introduction of the bans in February, 2014. 

Deputy Premier and Police Minister Troy Grant said no changes would be made to the 10pm bans before a statutory review was completed. 

""The statutory review will be evidence based, and changes, if any, to the laws will not be made lightly,"" Mr Grant said. 

He said the Office of Liquor Gaming and Racing investigation and subsequent conviction of Harbourside Cellars proved venues that ignored the laws would be heavily penalised. 

""These laws are in place to curb alcohol fuelled violence by limiting excessive 'pre-loading' by patrons before they enter licensed venues, making nights out safer for everyone,"" he said. 

The review is examining the impact of the ban in regional areas and will look at the impact on metropolitan areas in February next year.

86c53e48-02d1-4b2d-a885-67ff2651fd90,"Nassau County and Town of Oyster Bay officials are joining residents of several communities in urging the state to restore a ban on large trucks along South Oyster Bay Road. 
 
The rumbling of big rigs past homes, a school, stores and offices has residents worried about children getting hit crossing the street and trucks colliding with cars, and has spurred complaints about noise disturbing neighborhood tranquillity. 
 
In December, the state Department of Transportation granted a request made on behalf of FedEx Corp. to deem four miles of the road -- from the LIE to Route 107 -- as a ""designated truck access highway,"" allowing double-trailer trucks up to 65 feet long as well as auto carriers up to 75 feet long. The previous truck limit was 48 feet. A FedEx facility is near the southern terminus of the road in Bethpage. 
 
NYSDOT spokesman Gary Holmes said the department notified county and town officials of the proposed designation, but neither objected. If either had, the department would have been required under state law to hold a ""public informational meeting"" on the proposal. 
 
Town Councilwoman Rebecca Alesia said South Oyster Bay is a county road and that the county should have filed an objection. 
 
But county public works spokeswoman Mary Studdert said a letter from a state engineer was addressed to a town official, not the county, and that the town has jurisdiction over truck-related issues. 
 
Hicksville resident Tanya Lukasik said she's frustrated how ""they're all pointing fingers at each other."" Both town and county officials should have notified residents, who found out about it when trucks appeared, she said. 
 
State Assemb. Michael Montesano (R-Glen Head) said that, as a result of the change, staffers in his office are drafting legislation requiring the state to directly notify the public of a proposed truck designation. 
 
""The public should be notified and have their input because they're the ones who have to live with it every day,"" he said. 
 
Jane Harrigan, principal of Our Lady of Mercy School, said trucks put children at risk crossing South Oyster Bay to get to class and school buses and cars turning left onto school property. She fears trucks may not be able to stop in time to avoid a tragedy. 
 
FedEx officials said in a statement that a planned expansion led to the request for a new truck route that other businesses use as well. 
 
Alesia said trucks should use nearby Route 106/107, a longtime truck route. She said that at Tuesday's town board meeting she plans to propose a public hearing on legislation being drafted to impose truck restrictions on South Oyster Bay Road. 
 
But Holmes said the town cannot override the state on truck access roads. Federal law required the state to grant the requested designation because certain safety criteria were met, and withdrawal of the designation can only occur if safety problems -- such as truck accidents or large trucks veering into other lanes while turning -- can be proven, he said. 
 
""If nothing's changed in the areas we review, the designation has to stand,"" Holmes said.",Pols to state: Restore truck ban on local road,News,Newsday,2015-09-28T10:07:57Z
e040b6cb-ad86-4468-988f-a449bc2b8fd6,"""This knowledge may improve embryo development after in vitro fertilisation [IVF] and might provide better clinical treatments for infertility,"" she said in a statement, adding that any donated embryos would be used for research purposes only. 

Scientists around the world are currently debating the potential future use of new genetic technology known as CRISPR-Cas9, which allows researchers to edit virtually any gene, including in human embryos. 

While the technology can enable scientists to find and change or replace genetic defects, critics say it also has the potential to create ""designer babies"" to order. 

A spokesman for the HFEA noted that British law bans genome editing of embryos for use in treatment, but allows it for research if done under an HFEA licence. 

He confirmed that said the HFEA had received an application to use CRISPR-Cas9 in a licensed research project, and said it would be considered in due course. 

Sarah Chan at Edinburgh University's Usher Institute for Population Health Sciences and Informatics said the request for HFEA permission ""should be cause for confidence, not concern."" 

""Genome editing research undeniably has tremendous scientific potential, and UK scientists are poised to make a world-leading contribution to this exciting field,"" she said. ""At the same time, we should be reassured to know that this work is being carried out under a robust regulatory scheme that ensures high scientific and ethical standards."" 

Chinese biologists reported in April that they had carried out the first ever experiments to edit the DNA of human embryos.

The woman filmed abusing a Chinese-Australian woman on a bus who was arrested while allegedly racially abusing another person could be behind a number of similar tirades around Sydney. 

NSW Police said the 55-year-old woman arrested on Friday was taken to Merrylands police station on reports she spat on a teenage girl in while boarding a train at Parramatta. 

The arrest comes after Lindsay Li, 29, filmed a prolonged verbal attack that started while she was waiting in Willoughby for the city-bound 273 bus at lunchtime on Wednesday. 

Police have been investigating a number of similar assaults around Sydney's transport hubs including Central, Bondi Junction, Edgecliff, Eastwood, Hornsby, Parramtta and North Sydney, Fairfax reports.

There is also speculation she is the same woman filmed racially abusing a Chinese-Australian couple in August for ""taking our jobs"" in Wynyard Park in the CBD. 

That incident was filmed by a bystander who told her to ""Take a walk"" and leave the couple alone. 

In that video the woman mentions Israel, the US, China and weapons trading before several people tell her to go away. 

Other reports include a woman similar in description to the one in Ms Li's video abusing a girl on a school excursion, leaving her upset after calling her a ""suicide bomber"". 
Lindsey li was on a bus in Willoughby when an alleged 'Jewish from Israel' gave her a mouthful of racial abuse. Photo: Supplied 
She could also be behind a number of alleged verbal attacks levelled at passengers at Central and Edgecliffe stations earlier this month, which include spitting on some passengers. 

In Wednesday's incident, Ms Li says the woman approached her and ""spat on her"" before unleashing the verbal attack that started at the bus stop and continued on the journey. 

The woman said to Ms Li: ""I am Jewish from Israel, and you are f---ing nothing"" as she looked directly into the camera. 
The elderly woman told Ms Li ""I don’t have any money, you have plenty of money because you stealing all them."" Photo: Supplied 
She also allegedly struck Ms Li with her shopping trolley and pushed in front of her when the bus arrived. 

A terrified Ms Li then pulled out her phone and began filming the woman who let fly with a series of racial slurs. 

""Take your f----n' language and p--- off,"" the woman said.

Ms Li woman said she was completely terrified and questioned why the bus driver did not intervene. 

The woman was ""screaming in a racial tirade, just calling me every name under the sun,"" Ms Li told Fairfax. 

""I'm feeling so threatened at this point ... I've gone to the bus driver you need to stop and call the police,"" she added. 
Ms Li was in contact with a lawyer who told her that ""she could be mentally ill and therefore a vulnerable group in society."" Photo: Supplied 
""[The bus driver] has just completely ignored me and kept driving and I'm screaming at him going you need to stop the bus now."" 

A State Transit Authority spokesperson said in a statement the bus driver followed the necessary procedures, ""included making a call to State Transit's Network Control Centre to request assistance, about one minute after being notified by the customer, and as soon as it was safe to do so"". 

However, the abuse continued as the elderly woman tells Ms Li: “You pay for this, because I sue you, because I’m the poor one. 

""No one was standing up for me. This woman was so unstable I thought she could physically attack me at any time,"" Ms Li claimed. 

Ms Li contacted a lawyer who told her that the abuser ""could be mentally ill and therefore a vulnerable group in society"".",Racist ranter possibly serial offender: police,News,Countryman,2015-09-26T03:09:48Z

5ff15e3a-33da-47fd-b7dd-e98d435042b1,"MOSCOW, Sept 20 ( ) - CSKA Moscow, reduced to 10 men after 12 minutes and trailing 3-0 after a quarter of an hour, hit back with six second-half goals to beat Mordoviya 6-4 away in a remarkable Russian Premier League match on Sunday. 

CSKA got off to an awful start when goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev had an attempted clearance charged down by Evgeny Lutsenko who was left with the job of tapping the ball into an empty net in the first minute. 

The league leaders then had Mario Fernandes sent off in the 12th minute and Vladimir Rykov curled in the resulting free kick for Mordoviya's second. Two minutes later, Ruslan Mukhametshin finished off a counter-attack to make it 3-0. 

Leonid Slutskiy's team pulled one back six minutes after halftime through substitute Kirill Panchenko and the hosts were also reduced to 10 men when Yannick Djalo was sent off for a second bookable offence four minutes later. 

The tide turned as Zoran Tosic and Seydou Doumbia scored twice in a minute to pull CSKA level just before the hour, only for Lutsenko to put the hosts back in front with just over 20 minutes left. 

Nigeria forward Ahmed Musa equalised in the 80th minute, then put the visitors 5-4 in front before Ivory Coast forward Doumbia, who re-joined CSKA on loan from Roma this season, scored his second with two minutes to play. 

CSKA stayed top of the Russian Premier League table with 25 points from nine matches, five ahead of Lokomotiv Moscow who beat Kriylia Sovetov 2-0. 

Defending champions Zenit St Petersburg are a further three points behind in third after being held 1-1 at home by midtable Amkar.    (Editing by Brian Homewood)",Ten-man CSKA hit back from three down for 6-4 win,News,Mail Online UK,2015-09-20T19:23:53Z

According to a new market report published by Transparency Market Research ' Cell Culture Media, Sera, and Reagents Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2015 - 2023',  the global cell culture media, sera, and reagents market was valued at US $3.7 billion in 2014 and is estimated to reach US $7.1 billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 7.6% from 2015 to 2023. 
 
The cell culture market has been extensively analyzed on the basis of media, sera, and reagents. The cell culture media segment has been sub-segmented into chemically defined, classical, lysogeny broth, protein-free, serum-free, and specialty media. The cell culture sera segment has been sub-segmented into fetal bovine serum, newborn calf and adult bovine serum, and others. The cell culture reagents segment has been sub-segmented into albumin, amino acids, attachment factors, growth factors and cytokines, protease inhibitors, and others. The albumin segment has been further studied for human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, and recombinant serum albumin. The growth factors and cytokines segment has been studied for insulin-like growth factors, interleukins and interferon, tumor necrosis factors, and other growth factors and cytokines.

Cell culture media has been identified as the largest segment of the cell culture media, sera, and reagents market in 2014. Cell culture industry experts are of the opinion that end-users seek high quality media that provide both reproducible results as well as robust yields. The adoption of chemically defined media has been slow yet steady for both media manufacturers and bio processors. Demand for media has been shifting from serum-based to serum-sparing, serum-free animal derived, and chemically-defined media. Improvements in cell productivity and cell culture have led to the adoption of smaller processes that employ single use equipment. This has increased demand for ready-to-use liquid media and media powders.

Sera provides wide range of macromolecules, trace elements, carrier proteins, spreading factors, hormones, low molecular weight nutrients, and other growth factors. Serum is commonly used as a supplement in cell culture media. Serum in general is an imprecise component of cell culture media, as a number of serum-free media formulations are being developed and introduced in the market. In addition, media without serum or animal derived components are considered ideal for the study of the role and function of small molecule drug candidates.

Chris Cannella, 39, followed a United Nations motorcade into JFK around 6 p.m. on Saturday and flashed his retired FDNY badge at a security check to get onto the tarmac, the document says. 
 
Cannella was allegedly driving a black Chevy Tahoe similar to the SUVs used by the NYPD and the United Nations. 
 
The retired firefighter was stopped by detectives as he sat outside a second checkpoint and asked why he was following the motorcade. Cannella allegedly said he wanted to give the pope his business card and that he wanted to meet with world leaders to affect change. 
 
Cannella also explained to officers that the secret service had let him in at a previous checkpoint, and he showed them a cellphone video of him driving through the checkpoint, the court document says. 
 
Upon further investigation, Port Authority police found a 9mm magazine containing five hollow point rounds of ammunition in the trunk of his car and a plastic bag containing marijuana and a marijuana cigarette in the car’s cup holder, the complaint says. 
 
Cannella also allegedly later tore apart a chair in an interrogation room and  threatened an officer with the broken pieces. 
 
He is charged with criminal impersonation, criminal mischief, unauthorized possession of a pistol and/or revolver/ammunition, firearms ammunition feeding device, criminal trespass and unlawful possession of marijuana. It was unclear if he had an attorney.

d09da799-b1c3-4690-a74b-e5913c5ac50d,"Hayne makes his NFL debut for San Francisco 

Andrew Webster on Hayne's debut    SANTA CLARA: Jarryd Hayne has been determined not to allow emotion derail his NFL ambitions, but for a fleeting moment after seeing the Australian flag in the crowd following his 49ers debut, those emotions came to the surface. 

It's been all about ""staying in the grind"" and ""working hard"" for the 27-year-old rugby league convert, but as he made his way towards the tunnel at Levi's Stadium on Monday night, the sight of his nation's flag triggered a sense of realisation for what he had just accomplished less than a year since walking out on the NRL. 

""It was a bit emotional seeing that flag,"" Hayne said inside the 49ers locker room after the 20-3 win against the Minnesota Vikings. 

""It brought back memories. Realising how far I've come, everyone supporting me. That's the biggest thing. Even coming to the game. Listening to a couple of church songs. That emotion getting stirred up, thinking how far I've come and how far my faith has led me. 

""It's been a great journey. Everyone back home has been incredible and I'll be forever grateful. I can't say thanks enough."" 

It might be remembered for ""that fumble"", but Hayne defied the odds when he walked out on to that field for his maiden NFL appearance after just four pre-season games under his belt. 

Most thought he'd never make it. Most of the rest thought it would take some time. 

Not even Hayne himself envisaged he would be lacing the boots in September, but here he was. 

While Australia, and the United States for that matter, view him as the man who left rugby league to try his hand at another sport, Hayne no longer sees himself that way. 

""I guess it's tough to look back and see how far I've come,"" Hayne said after the match. 

""Everything happens so fast over here. Every day I don't go into meetings thinking 12 months ago I was in Australia playing in another league. I'm just in there learning. Doing my best."" 

Whether Hayne would be included in the 49ers' 46 active players against the Vikings on Monday night was the biggest talking point surrounding the Australian in the lead up to the match. 

There was plenty of conjecture, with head coach Jim Tomsula adding fuel to the fire during the week when he said the players were aware if they would be playing. 

But Hayne insists even he wasn't sure if he would be strutting his stuff in front of his family and friends, including Parramatta Eels captain Tim Mannah. 

""I didn't really find out. It was kind of, I got a couple of reps a few days ago and that's when it starting ticking over that I might get the call up,"" Hayne said. 

""Then, yeah, it wasn't really clear. Just one of those things you mould into like 'Oh, alright, I'm playing'. I'd obviously heard whispers and what not but I wanted to make sure that we were on and that was the case when we walked in. 

""I'm not too sure [how it works], this is my first time. It was one of those things, when you're training and getting reps you kind of realise if you're active or not, if you're on the cusp of being active. I just prepared the best I could. My first professional game, I found it a bit shaky but it was good to get on there and get a couple of runs."" 

There were plenty of Australians cheering on the former NSW Origin fullback, including former Test centre Mark Gasnier. 

But it's not just his own who have embraced his journey as he has quickly developed a cult following among the US contingency of the 49ers faithful. 

""I wouldn't say I'm a part of it yet,"" Hayne said when he asked if he felt like he was part of the culture at the club. 

""I still have a long way to go. I learnt that tough lesson tonight. For me it's just about getting back into the playbook. We'll obviously do video all week. 

""It's a shorter week playing Pittsburgh next week. For me it's about getting back on that grind, working hard and getting ready for Pittsburgh.""",Australian flag triggers Hayne's emotional realisation,News,Good Fruit & Vegetables Magazine,2015-09-15T07:17:25Z

0ba681d8-e236-4653-beee-bd8f9fc1b530,"Posted   Today  at 9:02 a.m.  

LOS ANGELES — ""Game of Thrones,"" HBO's wildly popular medieval fantasy series, may have served up gory beheadings, scintillating sex scenes, fire-breathing dragons and an ever-expanding battle for the Iron Throne, but it has never won the most important crown of all: the Emmy award for best drama series. 

Despite commanding a formidable fan base with 20 million viewers per episode, 16 million Facebook fans and 3 million Twitter followers, ""Game of Thrones,"" based on George R. R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" novel series, has yet to win over Emmy voters. 

The show premiered in 2011 and has been nominated four times in the best-drama race. But voters of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, deciders of the Emmy awards, traditionally shun fantasy in favor of realism in drama. 

All that could change at Sunday's Emmy Awards. 

""Thrones"" has a leading 24 nominations, and all 18,000 members of the Television Academy can vote for best drama, compared with around 1,000 in the past, said Tom O'Neil, founder of awards tracker Gold Derby ( www.goldderby.com ). 

""Everyone is voting online, so you will get more broad-based popular results that would benefit 'Game of Thrones',"" he said. 

The biggest competitors for ""Thrones"" are AMC's period drama ""Mad Men,"" which concluded this year in a widely praised finale, and Netflix's political thriller ""House of Cards,"" according to Entertainment Weekly TV writer Lynette Rice. 

""Simply by virtue of lack of competition, it looks good for 'Game of Thrones,' but also this season was an extraordinary year for the show,"" Rice said. 

""Homeland,"" ""Downton Abbey,"" ""Better Call Saul,"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" round out the drama series contenders. 

The fifth season of ""Game of Thrones"" featured new lands and an army of the walking dead. But it proved controversial for its scenes of brutality against women, including a violent rape, burning a little girl at the stake and shaming a major female character with a naked walk though a city. 

Emmy wins don't seem to be a primary concern for ""Game of Thrones"" fans. 

Instead, after season five became the most-watched series ever for Time Warner Inc's HBO and concluded in June with the death of hero Jon Snow (played by Kit Harington), fans online are consumed with whether the character will return. 

Speculation has ranged from sightings of Harington on set in Ireland to the actor's decision not to cut his shoulder-length brown locks, which have become a trademark of his character.

5a9a2769-f0c1-4692-b987-6a5a3dafe117,"ST. PETERSBURG -- Slade Heathcott connected for a go-ahead three-run home run off closer Brad Boxberger , capping a four-run ninth-inning rally as the Yankees stunned the Rays, 4-1, on Monday night at Tropicana Field. 
 
The Yankees were down to their final out in the ninth before Alex Rodriguez delivered a run-scoring double off Boxberger, chasing home Brett Gardner with the tying run. Following an intentional walk to Brian McCann , the 24-year-old Heathcott slugged his second career home run over the left-field wall, pumping his fist wildly as he rounded the bases. 
   
The late rally off Boxberger helped the Yankees close within three games behind the idle Blue Jays in the American League East chase. Logan Forsythe had knocked home the game's first run with an eighth-inning double off Justin Wilson . 
 
Rays starter Erasmo Ramirez held the Yankees hitless into the eighth inning in a gem of a performance. Carlos Beltran broke up Ramirez's bid with a shot to first base that was immediately scored as a hit, as Ramirez completed 7 2/3 innings, walking two and striking out six. 
 
Making his second start since returning from the disabled list, Yankees starter CC Sabathia turned in one of his best outings of the season, blanking Tampa Bay on three hits over 6 2/3 innings. He was relieved by Wilson, who pitched out of trouble in the seventh but surrendered the decisive hits in the eighth. 
 
MOMENTS THAT MATTERED 
Mahtook steals a run: Rays right fielder Mikie Mahtook stole a run with one out in in the seventh when McCann hit a ball to the wall in right. Standing on second base, Gardner broke for home thinking that McCann's hit would land. But Mahtook leaped at the wall and made the grab. He then rebounded and threw a strike to shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera covering at second to complete the inning-ending double play.

9/14/15: Mikie Mahtook tracks a fly ball to the wall in right and makes a leaping grab, then throws into second to complete the double play 

Sabathia deals: As sharp as Ramirez was, Sabathia matched him with zeros into the seventh inning, throwing a season-high 111 pitches and earning a standing ovation from the pro-Yankee contingent at the Trop. The big lefty looked terrific, striking out six while issuing just two walks. Sabathia pitched out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the second inning, getting Kevin Kiermaier to ground into a fielder's choice and J.P. Arencibia to fly out.

Research and Markets ( http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/vn35ws/lawn_and_garden ) has announced the addition of the ""Lawn and Garden Supplies in the U.S., 10th Edition"" report to their offering. 
   
Total retail sales of the L&G supplies market, consisting of fertilizers, growth media, grass seed, and pesticides at $5.7 billion in 2014. Growth media accounted for an estimated 35% of the total, pesticides 32%, fertilizers 24% and grass seed 9% of total sales. 

Forecasting future market sales is near impossible given so many variables. However Packaged Facts projects retail sales of the L&G supplies market will increase by a CAGR of 3% to reach $6.6 billion in 2019. Many assumptions are built into the forecast including improvement in the economy, a sustained housing recovery, and an increase in household formations. Weather will have a significant impact on the forecast and is impossible to predict. Continued drought conditions and severe water restrictions in some parts of the U.S. will likely have a negative impact on several products segments, although products that promote water efficiency can outperform. 

The L&G supplies market in the U.S. is dominated by the so-called big box stores - mass retailers and three chains in particular: home centers Home Depot and Lowe's, and mass merchandiser Walmart. The power of these retailers is illustrated by the fact that leading marketer Scotts Miracle-Gro generated nearly 70% of its Global Consumer segment sales in fiscal 2014 from the three chains. These so-called big box stores along with other mass retailers like Costco account for three quarters of L&G supply sales with the balance mainly coming from hardware stores (True Value, Ace, Menards) and garden centers/nurseries. Challenged by the discount prices of mass retailers, hardware stores and garden centers/nurseries tend to focus on service, expertise, convenience of being local, and brands that are exclusive to the channel.

Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto at the Hague (file photo). By Kenyan legal heavyweights failed to detect a loophole in an amendment to ICC rules that the court is now using in Deputy President William Ruto's case.

After successfully pushing for trial in absentia of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto, a Kenyan delegation led by Attorney General Githu Muigai accepted the controversial amendment that has now returned to haunt the DP.

ICC judges, using the amended law, have admitted testimony of five hostile witnesses against Ruto - sending shockwaves through the DP's inner circle.

The ruling has exposed Jubilee's soft underbelly, with Kalenjin politicians claiming the State has lifted its foot from the diplomatic pedal to extricate Ruto from the ICC.

The amendments to Rule 68 of the Rules of Procedure and evidence were adopted by the Assembly of States Parties in November 2013.

This appeared to be a trade-off, allowing use of video link or trial in absentia for suspects engaged in extraordinary public duties.

Muigai, Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed and the Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko led legal teams from their offices to represent Kenya at the meeting.

Several Jubilee MPs, including Kiharu's Irungu Kang'ata, also a lawyer, were present as Kenya reluctantly accepted Rule 68 - with the understanding it would not be applied in the Kenyan cases.

At that time Uhuru's case was just about to start. It has since been dropped.

""We have achieved all that we came to achieve,"" Amina told reporters after the ASP allowed trial in absentia.

""It was through the spirit of give and take...The ICC has been telling us our President and deputy president are mere suspects at the court and should be treated as such. Not anymore after these amendments.""

But it appears the belief that the rules would not be applied retroactively, and more specifically to the Kenyan situation, was not written down or captured in law.

Ruto's legal team attached newspaper articles to convince ICC judges of the supposed undertaking to spare the DP and his co-accused Sang from the amended rule.",DP Ruto Haunted By ICC Loophole,News,AllAfrica.com,2015-09-04T10:38:27Z

584fd6a9-3b40-4168-bf26-9021a33ceda7,"MELVILLE, N.Y. , Sept. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Henry Schein Cares, the global corporate social responsibility program of Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC), has partnered once again this year with Integrated Medical Foundation (IMF) and the Large Urology Group Practice Association (LUGPA) to help raise awareness among families across the country about the importance of putting prostate cancer screenings on the calendar for the men in their lives. September  back-to-school time for the children of many families  is also National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, which focuses the nation's attention on this potentially deadly disease. 

""We anticipate that there will be approximately 220,000 new diagnoses of prostate cancer this year, and about 28,000 people will lose their lives,"" said Dr. Deepak A. Kapoor , President, Advanced Urology Centers of New York ; Clinical Associate Professor of Urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai ; Chairman of Health Policy and Immediate Past-President of LUGPA; Founder and Past-President of Integrated Medical Foundation. ""Prostate Cancer Awareness Month is an opportunity to remind those closest to us  fathers, grandfathers, sons, husbands and friends  to speak with their doctor to determine if prostate cancer screening is right for them. Together, we can help generations of men continue to live happy, healthy lives."" 

According to the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer for men in America, with one out of every seven U.S. men diagnosed with the disease in their lifetime. 

Additionally, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, behind only lung cancer, resulting in the deaths of about 1 in 38 men. 

""Promoting wellness and raising awareness about important health issues, especially illness and disease that can be prevented through early detection, is a key component of the Henry Schein Cares mission,"" said Dave McKinley , President of Henry Schein Medical. ""As the nation gets ready during September to prepare our children to return to the classroom, we are pleased to partner with IMF and LUGPA to educate the public about the benefits of speaking with their doctors about whether a prostate cancer screening is right for them."" 

In honor of the observance, Henry Schein , Inc., the world's largest provider of health care products and services to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners, will support IMF and LUGPA with a series of communication efforts to heighten awareness among practitioners and the public about the importance of early detection in the fight against prostate cancer.

SAN FRANCISCO , Sept. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Helen Diller Family Foundation is now accepting nominations for the 2016 Diller Teen Tikkun Olam  Awards, a program that recognizes up to 15 Jewish teens annually with $36,000 each to be used in support of a social justice project or to further their education.  This Call for Nominations presents an opportunity for educators, civic leaders, and teen mentors in communities across the United States , to acknowledge Jewish teens whose thoughtful approach to making a difference is creating meaningful change in their communities and the world around them. 

Up to five teens from California and ten from other communities nationwide will be acknowledged for demonstrating exceptional leadership and successfully working to make the world a better place. Anyone interested in nominating a teen, or any teen interested in self-nominating, should visit www.dillerteenawards.org to begin the nomination process. The  deadline for nominations is December 1, 2015 .  

The Diller Teen Tikkun Olam Awards began as the vision of Bay Area philanthropist Helen Diller in 2007, as a way to recognize the next generation of socially committed leaders whose dedication to volunteerism exemplifies the spirit of tikkun olam , a central Jewish precept meaning to repair the world . In its nine-year history, the Diller Teen Tikkun Olam Awards has given more than $2.5 million to 70 teens from more than 20 U.S. communities. 

""Each year's nominations for the Diller Teen Tikkun Olam Award are fascinating: we never know who will apply, what are the concerns of teens in that year, and what projects they will have devised to help solve the needs they uncover,"" said Jackie Safier , Helen Diller's daughter and President of the Helen Diller Family Foundation. ""We do know that the unusual creativity, hard work, and passion demonstrated by each year's applicants is impressive. The Helen Diller Family Foundation has been so gratified to initiate this national program and to support the vision and actions of the first 70 award recipients. These past recipients, community leaders of the future, inspire us with the hope they represent."" 

A video of the 2015 recipients spotlights the power of commitment, passion, and leadership behind each teen project, and inspires hope for real solutions to real world problems. Past recipients of the Diller Teen Tikkun Olam Awards have made their mark through projects that champion a wide range of causes including: changing attitudes about bullying and special needs through peer-to-peer programs, outfitting a school district with solar power, building water wells in Tanzania and Nicaragua , improving life for kids with incarcerated parents, fighting hunger and promoting nutrition in low-income communities, and many more . 

The Diller Teen Tikkun Olam Awards is one of many projects funded by the Helen Diller Family Foundation, a supporting foundation of the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco , the Peninsula, Marin , and Sonoma Counties, to develop leadership in teens and enhance Jewish education. 

Beyond bolstering national recognition of the teens and their projects, the Diller Teen Tikkun Olam Awards program fosters a growing network of award recipient alumni who collaborate on leadership, innovation, and volunteer service across the nation. Members of the alumni network inspire new awardees to follow in their tikkun olam footsteps by mentoring them in future endeavors. 
  
Awardees have been recognized by some of the world's foremost institutions and leaders, including the United Nations Foundation, the White House, the Clinton Global Initiative, Forbes 30 Under 30, The Jefferson Awards, CNN Heroes, and the Nickelodeon HALO Awards. 

QUALIFICATIONS FOR NOMINATION: 
Teens may be nominated by any community member who knows the value of their project (except a family member) or may self-nominate.  Each candidate must be a U.S. resident aged 13-19 years old at the time of nomination, who self-identifies as Jewish.  Community service projects may benefit the general or Jewish community, with impact locally, nationally, or world-wide.  Teens' work must be as volunteers—without compensation for their services.

The valedictory function of the three-day State conference of the Yogakshema Sabha witnessed unexpected scenes with Sabha chief Akkeeraman Kaalidasan Bhattathirippad, moving away from his usual genial disposition, lambasting Chief Minister Oommen Chandy who was absent from the function. Delivering his presidential address, Mr. Bhattathirippad said it was not proper on the part of the Chief Minister to abstain from the function, in spite of the fact that he was present in the town and had participated in public functions. Mr. Chandy was expected to inaugurate the valedictory function. However, he refrained from the responsibility citing voice rest advised by doctors. 

“He used to attend the functions of even petty shops. What he did, is not proper,” he said and warned that the Chief Minister would come to know about the real strength of the community in due course. Politicians should treat all members of society alike, once they were elected, he said and added that the community would respond for the neglect in the coming local bodies’ election. 

The community had always maintained high moral and ethical values in life and whenever they felt there was degeneration, the community had worked out its corrective mechanism.

Seed Spot is partnering with the City of Phoenix to help the five finalists in the Phoenix Smart City App Hack develop their ideas as they compete to win the civic-focused app competition. The winner will move on to represent Phoenix in the international competition at the Smart City Expo in Barcelona in November, according to a press release from the City of Phoenix. 

The five finalists will get technical support and expert guidance in taking their ideas and making them into a reality. They’ll get to participate for free in Seed Spot’s evening program for entrepreneurs, where they’ll have access to their curriculum, their experts and mentoring programs. 

Phoenix Vice Mayor Daniel Valenzuela said the public-private partnership between Seep Spot and the City shows that Phoenix is becoming the most generous community for entrepreneurs. 
 
“Entrepreneurs with drive and vision can fuel their dreams right here in Phoenix with all home-grown resources and talent,” he said in the press release. 

Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton called the five finalists like the City’s tech-Olympic team. 

The app builders had to provide a solution to one of five global civic challenges: urban mobility, energy and emissions, shopping and retail, culture and tourism, and the collaborative city. 

Here’s a little bit about each of the five finalists, according to the City of Phoenix: 

·         ParkX allows drivers to pay for parking at parking meters directly from their smartphone.

c4fcac25-0f2a-47b8-a111-6d5e83b0b2df,"Bachelor Sam Wood finally clears up rumours about on-screen tantrums, what it's really like to be the Bachelor, and reveals he found love on the show. 

The Bachelor contestants are 'sleep deprived'Jacinda slams Sam Wood's trick date

Sam Wood just wants the world to meet the woman he has fallen in love with.

""It's a combination of mystery and frustration,"" the handsome Bachelor sighs.

""You'd just like to be able to introduce each other to your friends and be out in public and just be as normal as you could be.""

The 35-year-old's close-knit family is also in the dark about the woman who has won his heart.

""They're really enjoying seeing if they can work it out, like my closest friends.""

""I reckon if I went to tell them, they'd tell me to shut up, so we're not going to ruin the surprise.""

Wood's run as the star of Ten's The Bachelor is coming to an end, and with only six girls remaining, the strain is starting to show.

On Wednesday's episode, the personal trainer takes the unprecedented step of leaving a rose ceremony, unable to choose which girl to send home.

""It was really about just taking a big deep breath and putting the brakes on and finding out what my options were.""

""I was thinking 'I've got five girls here that are all incredible and the sixth girl at this point is someone who I would have had one conversation with'.

""It just didn't seem fair to say goodbye to her before I've even had a proper conversation with her.""

Wood says he's doing things his own way as the Bachelor and following his gut instincts when taking the unusual steps of either sending girls home early or sending none home at all. 

What an ending! We can't wait to see what drama tomorrow's show brings! #TheBachelorAUpic.twitter.com/jF8YWxmW1s— The Bachelor Aus (@TheBachelorAU) August 26, 2015

""It all happens so fast, you don't spend any time with the girls off-camera, so you've got to be as perceptive as you can.""

""It's not just conversations. It could be a look, it could be body language.""

So how does he handle the pressure of having to choose which beautiful girl to send home each week?

""You just have to continually remind yourself that you're not here to make a group of great friends, you're here to fall in love and hopefully spend the rest of your life with them.""

""I guess that's the thing that I kept my eye on and knew that if I did, everything would work out in the end, and it did.""

On-screen tantrums 

Allegations about meddling producers have rocked the show in recent weeks, the most spectacular coming from burned contestant Emily who got drunk and stormed out of a rose ceremony.

""To be honest, I just think they're excuses to justify someone's behaviour,"" Wood says.

""Honestly, the girls can have no alcohol if they want for the entire 14 weeks or they can drink champagne and get drunk.

""They're adults making adult decisions and if Emily was drunk it's because Emily decided to get drunk. That's the absolute truth.

""I genuinely believe that people are portrayed on the show how they are in real life.""

A day in the life of the Bachelor 

While the girls have each other for company in the mansion, does the 'Bachie' spent his days brooding in solitary confinement?

""I'm literally on a single date or on a group date five or six days a week for 12 or 15 hours a day for 13 weeks.""

""It's a huge amount of filming that then cuts down to the highlights on a date. Sarah and I were on a yacht for five hours and then it cuts down to five minutes.""

Wood says he also has input on the dates he takes the women on and tailors them to suit each girl, from glamorous yachts to not-so-glamorous bubble soccer group dates.

Osher Günsberg the wingman 

Handsome host Osher Günsberg has stolen the show with his great hair and funny recaps, but he's also Wood's wingman and good friend following Wednesday night's difficult rose ceremony.

""To a point, he's as close to a wingman as you have in the Bachelor bubble,"" Wood says.

""Osher's the consummate professional. He doesn't really get too involved because that's not the right thing for him to do but in that moment I remember thinking 'I need to talk to someone and I guess Osher is the person to talk to' so I sought him out.

""We were developing a real friendship and now that the show's finished filming we are great mates and I talk to him regularly.""

We won’t delve in to the various issues revolving around Apple’s Maps supplied with iOS 6, but it’s safe to say a number of people wish Apple had kept the Google Maps app instead. Luckily Google have released a dedicated Maps app, which just goes to prove that even a relatively simple sounding map tool can be so much more, as it packs navigation, traffic information, 3D views and Street View into one essential tool. 
 
Many mobile users will use maps to determine where they currently are and how to get from A to B. even if you don’t have a GPS enabled device, Google Maps can use nearby wifi access points to work out where you are and then provide you with turn by turn navigation to the destination of your choice. With the option to search for places and businesses, you can easily track down restaurants, landmarks and more, and discover how to get there. 
 
If you don’t need turn by turn navigation you can opt to simple generate directions and the new Compass Mode can prove useful to help you to work out which way you are facing and which way you need to head. Support for Google Latitude makes it possible to find out where you are in relation to your friends and layers can be used to view maps in different ways, adding useful information such as traffic and more. 
 
Three dimensional maps provide a great way to get our bearing and find out what’s nearby while the ever-useful Street View options makes it easier than ever to work out where you are and recognise where you need to be heading. Offline caching means that mapping is available even when you don’t have an internet connection. 
 
What’s new in v4.11.0?

• Call business & get directions directly from a list of places

ST. JOHN’S, Antigua, Sept 5, CMC – Antigua will host a two-day seminar as part of a project aimed at strengthening the environment and building resilience to climate change in the sub-regional Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). 

The St. Lucia-based OECS Commission said the September 9-10 seminar will include presentations from several stakeholders including the Water and Sewerage Company (WASCO) of St. Lucia, and the Ministry of Health and Environment in Antigua. 

The Commission said that the seminar will seek to do a stock-taking of the RRACC project as it prepares to enter its final year. 

“Presentations will therefore focus on the critical lessons learnt and the best practices employed by the Project during its life cycle. Some of the areas of focus during the seminar will include discussions on the policies, the climate change adaptation measures employed, the public awareness campaign, human resource development and capacity building initiatives.” 

The Commission said that so far six OECS member states – Antigua, Barbuda, Bequia, Dominica, Grenada, Nevis, St Kitts, St.Lucia, and St Vincent –  have benefited from the RRACC project in reducing risks associated with climate change in relevant sectors, by putting in place 11 projects that demonstrate various measures to build resilience. 

The RRACC Project is a five-year developmental project funded by United States Aid for International Development (USAID) to the tune of US$9.5 million, and is aimed at assisting OECS countries with building resilience through the implementation of climate change adaptation measures.",Antigua to host OECS climate change seminar,News,Antigua Observer,2015-09-06T12:56:28Z

42beec3e-e209-4c12-b82b-5ba8693b309e,"NEW YORK — McDonald’s says it will switch to cage-free eggs in the U.S. and Canada over the next decade, marking the latest push under CEO Steve Easterbrook to try and reinvent the Big Mac maker as a “modern, progressive burger company.” 

Under pressure to revive slumping sales, McDonald’s has already announced a number of changes since Easterbrook stepped into his role earlier this year. In March, the Oak Brook, Illinois company said it would switch to chickens raised without most antibiotics. And in April, it said it would raise pay for workers at company-owned stores, which represent about 10 percent of its domestic locations. 

The decision to switch to cage-free eggs, meanwhile, signals a growing sensitivity among customers to animal welfare issues. That has been fueled in part by places like Chipotle that have made animal welfare standards part of their marketing. 

Animal welfare activists also have long called for the banishment of battery cages, which confine hens to spaces so small they’re barely able to move. For at least the past 10 years, the Humane Society of the United States has pressed McDonald’s to switch to cage-free eggs at the company’s annual shareholders meeting, said Paul Shapiro, the group’s vice president of farm and animal protection. 

“It’s a real watershed moment,” Shapiro said of the decision by McDonald’s. “It makes it clearer than ever that cages just do not have a future in the egg industry.” 

Regulatory changes could also be making it easier for companies to agree to change. In California, a law now requires that egg-laying hens be given enough space to stretch, turn around and flap their wings. 

Among the companies that have said they will switch to cage-free eggs are Subway and Starbucks, although neither of those chains has laid out a timeline for when they expect the transition to be complete. 

Already, McDonald’s says it buys about 13 million cage-free eggs a year in the U.S. But that is still less than 1 percent of the 2 billion eggs it uses annually to make menu items such as Egg McMuffins. Overall, only about 6 percent of the nation’s egg-laying hens are cage-free, according to the United Egg Producers. Chad Gregory, CEO of the industry group, said he expects that figure to climb. 

Marion Gross, senior vice president of the North American supply chain at McDonald’s, said the company is working with its existing egg suppliers to convert housing systems for hens. Gross said she thinks the change will be “truly meaningful” to customers. 

“They know how big we are, and the impact we can make on the industry,” Gross said. 

McDonald’ is also likely to increase its egg purchasing over time; starting Oct. 6, the company plans to offer select breakfast items all day in the U.S.",McDonald's to switch to cage-free eggs,News,Toledoblade.com,2015-09-09T11:56:11Z
156782ae-864d-49ca-9153-9622269c4654,"We’re just a few hours away from the reveal of the next iPhone, whether that’s the iPhone 7 or iPhone 6S, and in the lead-up to the much anticipated launch, Apple has been looking to push people away from expectations of larger on-board storage. 
 
The current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus offer a new larger on-board storage option at 128GB, adding to the 16GB and 64GB models that were traditionally offered. 
 
But while Apple impressed fans looking to store more music, video or photos on the local device with the launch of a 128GB model, it’s unlikely this size will jump with the launch of the iPhone 7 or iPhone 6S. This is because Apple wants people to take advantage of the cloud for storage rather than looking to store even more on the smartphone itself. 
 
According to The Independent , Apple’s senior VP of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, told  The Talk Show podcast host John Gruber earlier this summer, “The belief is more and more as we use iCloud services for documents and our photos and videos and music that perhaps the most price-conscious customers are able to live in an environment where they don’t need gobs of local storage because these services are lightening the load.” 
 
The model makes sense for cost-conscious buyers. The 16GB iPhone 6 retails at £539, while making the jump to a 64GB model will cost £80 more at £619. Using Apple’s iCloud online storage service instead, you can get hold of an extra 20GB for just £12.79 a year, or a huge 200GB for £35.88 a year. 
 
With the launch of the iPhone 6, Apple did away with the previous middle sibling, the 32GB model, so users had to make a choice between either the smallest on-board storage of 16GB, or jump to the larger 64GB size. 
 
Smartphones don’t tend to come with much more storage than 128GB, the iPhone’s largest model. Cnet , which is one of the only devices to offer 256GB of internal storage. It also packs a microSD card slot for an additional 128GB, at a time when many device makers like Samsung and Google are doing away with the extra storage slot.

f1e0881f-d0ef-47dc-bd64-298ae927e9cb,"REDDING, California - A series of presentations on identity — including faith, dyslexia, inequality and other things that shape one’s self-view — kicks off Thursday at Shasta College. 

The college is putting on the free Identity Series throughout October, and all members of the community are encouraged to attend as well. 

“The Identity Series is part of our community discussions around how we identify ourselves, how we think about identity, how we begin to connect with others through that identity,” said Sharon Brisolara, associate dean of access and equity at Shasta College. 

Presentations are generally in the late morning or early afternoon on week days, culminating Oct. 28 with a talk on landscape and identity. 

Experts from different groups will discuss faith and identity on Thursday from 12 to 1:30 p.m. at the Student Center Stage in the cafeteria. Presenters will be Lynn E. Fritz of the Center for Spiritual Living, Iman Abu Bakr Salahuddin, representing the Islamic Center of Redding, Chris Carrigan of a local Buddhist group, and Doug Milhous, a local Quaker. 

The second presentation is on dyslexia and identity on Tuesday and will feature counselor Lisa Riggs moderating the discussion. 

On Oct . 7, Kate Ashbey, a member of the faculty, and Andrew Mack, a student, will discuss facing and embracing identity that will include talks on veterans’ issues and “making peace with your story.” 

Identity and Poetry will be led by sociology instructor Heather Wylie and communications instructor Claudia Mosby on Oct. 14. 

Inequality will be explored on Oct. 22 with Marc Dadigan, a community educator, and community advocate Carrie Joe Diamond discussing white privilege, journalism and genocide survivors. 

The series concludes on Oct. 28 with geology instructor Melinda Kashuba discussing how landscape can help shape identity. 

The series all ties into the college’s newly opened Office of Access and Equity, which began helping students with barriers to education in July. 

Brisolara said the opening of that office is part of a statewide initiative to improve college access to underserved groups. 

“If you come to college, it’s important that you have the support that you need to succeed,” she said.

Last week, the EPA ordered Volkswagen to recall about half a million vehicles, alleging that the company had used software in diesel-powered vehicles to cheat on U.S. emissions tests. On Sunday, the company announced it would halt U.S. sales of certain diesel-powered cars that the EPA says use the software, including 2015 and 2016 Volkswagen and Audi models that had been advertised to customers as “clean diesel.” Now, the market is responding accordingly, with the company’s stock price falling nearly 20 percent since Friday. 
 
The drop is a clear reaction to the fact that Volkswagen will now miss out on a key market in the U.S. and may well be slapped $18 billion in fines, according to Reuters . 
 
Volkswagen CEO, Martin Winterkorn, for his part, has issued an apology, saying in a statement , “I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public.”

Hollywood star Pierce Brosnan has defended his version of James Bond, saying he was less ""sexist and misogynistic"". 
 
Pierce Brosnan thinks his version of James Bond was less ""sexist and misogynistic"" than earlier incarnations. 

The 62-year-old actor - who starred as the iconic secret agent in four films, from 1995 to 2002 - has defended his version of Bond, suggesting he was more forward-thinking than prior incarnations. 

Pierce said: ""I never thought of him like that. I saw him as a solitary, enigmatic character."" 

However, he does, to some extent, agree with Daniel Craig's recent claim that Bond is ""very f**king lonely"". 

He told Digital Spy: ""I saw him as a fellow who carries a certain amount of pain and angst. Deep down as someone who's quite troubled, and solitary - [though] Ian Fleming really doesn't give you a lot to hang your hat on. 

""There's a lovely sequence in [novel 'Casino Royale'] where Bond is on a flight to Amsterdam and there is terrible turbulence and he's shaking in his shoes, from turbulence. 'The drink, the drink, give me the drink'."" 

Last month, meanwhile, Pierce revealed he would welcome a gay James Bond - but doesn't think it'll ever happen. 

Asked if he could picture a gay Bond, Pierce said: ""Sure. Why not? 

""Actually, I don't know how it would work. I don't think [producer Barbara Broccoli] would allow a gay Bond to happen in her lifetime. But it would certainly make for interesting viewing.""",Pierce Brosnan: My version of James Bond was less sexist,News,The List,2015-09-25T09:00:00Z

Sawbridgeworth CC's U17s were crowned Herts county champions after beating Harpenden by 49 runs.

Harpenden began slowly losing two quick wickets but then Lacey (73) took control well supported by Langley (53) and Stewart (17). 
 
The match turned with a superb running catch by Allen to dismiss Lacey. 

Harpenden's lower order then collapsed against Sam Timms, the Sawbridgeworth opening bowler, who finished with remarkable figures of 6-22 with the last three wickets of the game falling to a hat-trick and leaving Harpenden short of their target.

	A decision on the Mangalore site, which has total capacity of around 11 million barrels of oil, depends on Shell winning relief from local sales tax, the sources said, while commissioning has been pushed back by two months to December. 
 

	India, the world's No.4 crude consumer and one of the few major economies which is still seeing strong demand growth, is building up strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) facilities at three locations in the country's south that will hold a total 36.87 million barrels of oil, enough to cover almost two weeks of its needs. 
 

	Under the proposal, Shell would use the Mangalore site for commercial storage, but in the event of an emergency would have to make supplies available to state-run refiners and keep the site filled at specified levels. 
 

	Shell would likely store oil grades used by a nearby 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery owned by the state's Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemical Ltd (MRPL) , the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
 

	""It will be like a commercial storage for Shell, but in case of emergency the supplies will have to be made available to MRPL or any other (state-run) refiner,"" said one of the sources. 
 

	No decision had been made as to the origin of the oil to fill the facility, but it would most likely come from Africa where producers are looking for new buyers in the wake of the US shale oil boom. 
 

	MRPL currentlly buys an average 2 million barrel of sweet African grades every month from spot markets. 
 

	The government expected to resolve the local tax issue, if a leasing deal was reached, the sources said. 
 

	Shell and Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL), which is building the cavern, declined to comment. 
 

	ISPRL chief executive Rajan K. Pillai said the start-up of Mangalore's SPR, as well as sites at Padur further to the south, would be pushed back to December because of a delay in pipeline connections between the port and the storage sites. 
 

	Mangalore needed about 3 kms (1.9 miles) of pipelines, Pillai said. Padur, which has four divisions of about 4.6 million barrels each, lacked some 34 kms (21 miles) of pipeline.

7824a97a-0a29-4922-8ac7-d84cb3ac4fec,"Here’s my taxi question. 

If a person is law-abiding, has a driver’s license, has a car or van that has passed safety inspection, and has adequate liability insurance, is there any consumer-oriented reason he should not be able to become a taxicab owner/operator? 

Put another way: If you wish to hire the services of such a person, what right does a third party have to prevent that exchange? 

Many cities have granted monopoly power to taxi companies — the right to prevent entry by others. 

Sometimes this monopoly takes the form of exclusive government-granted rights to particular individuals to provide taxi services. 

In other cases, the number of licenses is fixed, and a prospective taxi owner must purchase a license from an existing owner. 

In New York City, such a license is called a taxi medallion. 

Individual medallions have sold for as high as $700,000 and corporate medallions as high as $1 million. 

In other cities — such as Miami, Philadelphia, Chicago and Boston — taxi licenses have sold for anywhere between $300,000 and $700,000. 

These are prices for a license to own and operate a single vehicle as a taxi. 

Where public utility commissions decide who will have the right to go into the taxi business, a prospective entrant must apply for a “certificate of public convenience and necessity.” 

Lawyers for the incumbent taxi owners, most often corporate owners or owner associations, appear at the hearing to argue that there is no necessity or public convenience that would be served by permitting a new entrant. 

Where medallions are sold, the person must have cash or the credit standing to be able to get a loan from a lender, such as the Medallion Financial Corp., that specializes in taxi medallion purchases. 

Medallion Financial Corp. has held as much as $520 million in loans for taxi medallions. 

So what are the effects of taxi regulation? 

When a person must make the case for his entry before a public utility commission, who is likelier to win, a single individual with limited resources or incumbent taxi companies with corporate lawyers representing them? 

I’d put my money on the incumbent taxi companies being able to use the public utility commission to keep the wannabes out. 

Who is handicapped in the cases in which one has to purchase a $700,000 medallion in order to own and operate a taxi? 

If you answered “a person who doesn’t have $700,000 lying around or doesn’t have the credit to get a loan for $700,000,” go to the head of the class. 

A natural question is: Who are the people least likely to be able to compete with corporate lawyers or have $700,000 lying around or have good enough credit to get such a loan? 

They are low- and moderate-income people and minorities. 

Many own cars and have the means to get into the taxi business and earn between $40,000 and $50,000 annually, but they can’t overcome the regulatory hurdle involved. 

Enter Uber and Lyft, two ride-hailing services. 

Both companies use freelance contractors who provide rides with their own cars. The companies operate mobile apps that allow customers with smartphones to submit trip requests, which are then routed to Uber or Lyft drivers, who provide taxi-like services with their own cars. 

The legality of these companies has been challenged by taxi companies and politicians who do the bidding of established taxi companies. 

They allege that the use of drivers who are not licensed to drive taxicabs is unsafe and illegal. 

Uber and Lyft drivers like the idea of working when they want to. Some have full-time jobs. 

Picking up passengers is an easy way to earn extra money. Everyone is happy about the arrangement except existing taxi companies and government officials who do their bidding. 

Taxi companies retain much of their monopoly because Uber and Lyft are prohibited from cruising. 

They are also prohibited from picking up passengers at most train stations and airports. But that monopoly may not last much longer. Let’s hope not.

A group of students and interns from the Hull School of Art & Design have been given the opportunity to design a series of art installations which will be located along the new diverted public right of way which runs around Hull’s Alexandra Dock, site of the new Siemens development. 
 
The group were given the chance to get involved in the project by Associated British Ports (ABP), which used local contractor CR Reynolds to build the new footpath and cycleway. 
 
ABP Project Manager Laura Morrish has been heavily involved in the planning and consenting of the development and approached the Hull School of Art & Design, part of Hull College to see if it had any students that would like to get involved. 
 
“As part of the planning consent for the scheme we were asked to add interest to the footpath by introducing a number of art installations along the route, which runs from Victoria Dock in the west, to the public car park on Northern Gateway further east,” said Laura. 
 
“We decided that this would be a perfect project for some of our local art students and when we approached them, they jumped at the chance. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have their creations on display next to a world-leading facility and we’re looking forward to seeing what the students come up with.” 
 
Anna Kirk-Smith of Hull School of Art & Design said:  “ABP has presented a fabulous opportunity to our BA (Hons) Fine Art students and Hatch graduate interns to gain career-developing experience in working on a live project. 
 
“The open-minded and supportive approach of ABP has given the students and interns the freedom to develop a diverse and imaginative array of site-specific sculptural proposals, linked by the maritime theme. 
 
“The five commissioned artists are learning the intricacies of the construction process – from their initial creative designs to the practical fabrication of the large-scale sculptures, alongside the associated planning, installation and legal issues of making public artworks. In addition, they have received generous support for the latter from Spearfish, a Manchester arts company specialising in delivering artforms in the public domain.” 
 
Six pieces made with new and reclaimed materials will be placed at strategic points along the pathway, all of which will represent Hull’s maritime heritage and its future. The works will be accompanied by permanent exhibition panels designed by local primary and secondary schools, and information boards telling the story of Alexandra Dock. 
 
ABP has donated materials and a number of pieces of equipment from the port estate, all of which is either no longer in use, or is surplus to requirements, and the students are able use these to create their artwork if they choose to. The submitted pieces will be judged by a panel of representatives from ABP, Spearfish, Hull City Council and Hull College of Art & Design in October, before students begin the build process.

f2ecc83c-ac8b-415c-b26a-b74eea0a9bf8,"TORONTO , Sept. 9, 2015 /CNW/ - Planning for and attaining a higher education is an exciting milestone for many Canadian students each year. While some students are motivated to obtain a higher education so they can afford material things, newly published research shows the majority of high school and post-secondary students define ""success"" based on their level of happiness, rather than by things like a big house or expensive car. 
 
The StudentNation Survey commissioned by D+H, a leading global financial technology company and the administrator of the Canadian Student Loans Program, asked Canadian high school and post-secondary students questions about their interests across a variety of topics including technology, the environment, personal finance, health, careers, social media, politics and more. 
 
When asked which of the following 12 statements are most aligned to students' definition of success, the leading answer among high school and post-secondary students was ""being happy most of the time"" at 65 per cent.  Having a ""job or career that I love"" ranked second with 63 per cent of high school students and 61 per cent of post-secondary students agreeing with this statement and ""owning a large house and expensive car"" ranked last with 24 per cent of high school students and 17 per cent of post-secondary students respectively. 
 
""Having a clear understanding of how students perceive the world around them has become increasingly important to businesses, including the financial institutions and governments we serve,"" says Chris Whyte , Senior Vice President of Lending at D+H Canada. ""Staying ahead of the evolving views and opinions of students, has helped D+H become the industry leader in student lending technology, and has helped inform how we support 1.7 million students on behalf of the Government of Canada , various provinces and  financial institutions."" 
 
Other interesting findings from the StudentNation Survey include: 
 
On Personal Finance: Six in 10 post-secondary students do not do a budget

On Environment: Interest in climate change comparatively low, but goes up with age 
 Only 17% of high school students said they were particularly interested in the environment and climate change, compared to 27% of post-secondary students  26% of post-secondary students said they buy from companies that are environmentally responsible, compared to 17% of high school students 
On Jobs: Only three in 10 post-secondary students are interested in job hunting 
 29% of post-secondary students are particularly interested in job hunting and careers, compared to 19% of high school students  23% of post-secondary students want to start their own business in the next 5-10 years, compared to 16% of high school students  30% of students said they would like to find an employer where they could spend their whole career 
On Social Media: Half of students are connected ""all the time"" 
 50% of post-secondary students said they are connected to social media almost ""all the time,"" compared to 54% of high school students  29% of post-secondary students said they are too open with their personal information online, compared to 23% of high school students  11% of high school and post-secondary students update their social media status daily

  Crunch time looms for Sutton Life Centre    Council to pay Chelsea FC to promote Sutton Life Centre   
But shutting the £8m Sutton Council -managed building, opened by then-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in 2010, would cost an extra £4m because of the way its construction was funded, a report said ahead of a crunch council meeting tonight. 
 
Fewer than half the borough’s schools are Life Centre customers and have paid to visit. The centre hosts a library and outdoor games area, and one of its main purposes is personal and social education for children. 
 
A Sutton Council spokesman said: “It is open to all schools in the borough. The ones that have chosen to visit, both inside and outside the borough, have given extremely positive feedback.” 
 
Cutting staff could save £100,000, according to strategy director Mary Morrissey, while converting the building for another provider – even if the council holds on to the library – could cost £2m. 
 
That option could also trigger the Cabinet Office’s £4m payback clause in the Life Centre agreement. 
   Promoted stories   
Conservative opposition leader Councillor Tim Crowley said: “It’s haemorrhaging so much money that other council services are having to be cut.” 
 
Asked whether he would lobby behind the scenes with MP Paul Scully and the new Conservative Government to help sell the site and avoid a £4m bill, he added: “I don’t know. We would love to have those conversations. Realistically the people who should be doing this are the council.”

Consultants Red Quadrant and SLC, hired by the council, said that “little attention has been given to marketing the outdoor sports facilities, children’s parties or the availability of alternative hireable space” and that the centre’s booking system is inadequate because there is no central record of appointments. 
 
But Miss Morrissey’s report said teachers’ “incredibly positive” feedback from visits included: “A visit should be compulsory/part of every school’s curriculum (Parents would benefit too).”",Face-off tonight over potential Sutton Life Centre cuts,News,Sutton Guardian,2015-09-17T04:00:00Z

Islamabad, Sep 6: Pakistan today marked the 50th anniversary of the 1965 war with India by holding nationwide ceremonies and special prayers, while the Pakistani leadership vowed to “frustrate” any threat to the country’s existence. The annual Defence Day celebrations began with a 31-gun salute here and with a 21-gun salute in provincial capitals. 

Across the country, a minute’s silence was observed in memory of nearly 4,000 soldiers killed in the war, with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif laying a wreath at the war memorial in Lahore. According to Radio Pakistan, numerous functions have been organised across the country, including at the army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi. (Also Read: ’Pakistan lost terribly in the 1965 war with India’) 

Prayers were held in mosques for progress and prosperity and also included special invocation for the dead soldiers. Strict security have been put in place across the country in face of the Taliban threat to disrupt the celebrations. In his message, President Mamnoon Hussain said: “In the successful Zarb-i-Azb operation, Pakistan Army has proved that any kind of threat posed to country’s security and existence will be frustrated. Pakistani nation and its armed forces can go to any extent in securing its borders and safeguarding its sovereignty. 

” 

Prime Minister Sharif said: “The exemplary unity demonstrated by the political and military leadership in curbing terrorism is yet another splendid chapter of our national history.” ”We desire to have good and peaceful relations with all our neighbours on the basis of sovereign equality,” he said.

NEW YORK (AP) — Orson Welles' personal manuscripts for ""Citizen Kane,"" including the film's final revised shooting script, brought over $102,000 at auction. 
 
The three screenplays were offered by Profiles in History on Tuesday. They illustrate the evolution in the creation of the classic masterpiece. 
 
An original first rough draft of ""American"" — the working title for ""Citizen Kane"" — written in 1940 by Welles' collaborator Herman Mankiewicz sold for $32,000. 
 
The Calabasas, California-based auctioneer says the next draft featuring a fuller evolution of the script brought $25,600. 
 
The third and final revised shooting script fetched $44,800. It includes Welles' handwritten annotations, directing notes and camera-angle diagrams. It's signed by most of the cast principals. 
 
The seller was a close friend of Welles who acquired the material from the filmmaker, who died in 1985.

Details about the report, including a downloadable excerpt are available at: http://ntechresearch.com/market_reports/markets-for-self-cleaning-coating-and-surfaces-2015-to-2022

This report is the latest deliverable from n-tech's research program on smart materials. Other n-tech reports from 2015 have covered smart windows, smart coatings, smart surfaces, self-healing materials, smart antimicrobials and color-shifting coatings. n-tech has provided of the smart materials business for more than six years.

About the report:

Self-cleaning materials will become one of the largest segments of the smart materials, but they have yet to achieve the necessary technological sophistication. Today's self-cleaning materials do not have long lifetimes and are often mediocre performers when it comes to their actual ability to self-clean. 

This report provides a roadmap for the technological evolution of self-cleaning materials, showing how self-cleaning technology will evolve over the next eight-years. It also provides an eight-year forecast in both revenue and volume terms of shipments of next-generation self-cleaning materials. These include hydrophobic, hydrophilic, electrostatic and catalytic materials. The report also covers multifunctional materials that combine self-cleaning materials with other functionalities, notably antimicrobial and self-healing materials.

The report also examines the product /market strategies related to self-cleaning materials of both large multinationals and the many startups that have already dipped a toe into the self-cleaning business. Applications discussed in this report include construction, energy, transportation, consumer products, textiles and clothing, medical, military and other.

Companies discussed in this report include: 3M, Active, Alcoa, Apple, Balcony Systems, BASF, BlueScope Steel, Borel, Cardinal Glass, Casalgrande, Cerma, Clover, Corning, Crossville, Dell, Deutsche Telekom, DryWired, DSM Biomedical

Ecoways, Essroc, Europlasma, Faurecia, Ford, Frigidaire, GE, Gentex, Grupo Antolin 

Reactive Surfaces, Saint-Gobain, SeePoint, SLIPS Technologies, Sto, Toto, Ultratech, Yanfeng 

Highlights:

Self-cleaning will find its biggest market in the construction industry, where it will generate $1.6 billion 

The self-cleaning materials market is currently dominated by mature hydrophobic and hydrophilic technologies which account for 94 percent of the revenues in this sector. Despite concerted efforts to improve this technology, conventional hydrophobic and hydrophilic technologies will have fallen to a 64 percent share of of total self-cleaning revenues by 2020.

Future opportunities in the self-cleaning materials space will be based on new technology directions especially novel catalysts for both photocatalytic surfaces and thermally driven self-cleaning purposes. This technology direction is expected to clock up more than $500 million

If you had only a small bag in which to pack your most valued and needed possessions, what would you fill it with?

For six-year-old Omran, part of that precious space is occupied by a zip-lock bag of marshmallows, the young boy's favourite snack, alongside a toothbrush, toothpaste and a pair of trousers and a shirt.

Omran, from Syria, is too young to comprehend fully the upheaval that is occurring around him. He is among the and other parts of the Middle East and Afghanistan, and risking their lives in a desperate dash for Europe and the hope of a new, safer life.

The International Rescue Committee, a global humanitarian aid organisation, spoke to a handful of those displaced people and photographed the meagre possessions they had managed to carry with them across the Aegean Sea to Lesbos, in Greece.

""Smugglers routinely exploit them, promising safety for a price, only to squeeze them like sardines into tiny boats,"" the committee said in a statement.

""Most have no option but to shed whatever meagre belongings they may have salvaged from their journeys. Those allowed to bring extra baggage aboard often toss it overboard, frantically dumping extra weight as the leaky boats take on water.""

Entitled What's in my bag?: What refugees bring when they run for their lives, the photo essay paints a bleak picture of life on the move.

e5d1dd37-0795-4a70-9bb6-e7c25dca95ad,"Auja — The wealth declaration of Nigeria's new president shows he has been living ""an austere and Spartan lifestyle,"" with $150,000 in his personal account, contrary to what many might expect of one who has held a number of top government positions, an official said Thursday. 

In the declaration, President Muhammadu Buhari stated that he had shares in Berger Paints, Union Bank and Skye Bank, said Garba Shehu, a senior special assistant in charge of media and publicity for the president in a statement. He did not reveal the value of the shares. 

Buhari has vowed to stamp out corruption, which is endemic in Africa's biggest economy. Buhari last month put the amount of money missing from state coffers at a staggering $150 billion. 

Shehu's statement also did not give values of all the assets held by the president and vice president saying the documents submitted to the Code of Conduct Bureau of will be made public as soon vetting is completed. 

Buhari has a total of five homes and two mud houses in Daura (Katsina state), Shehu said. In addition to the homes, he has farms, an orchard and a ranch with 270 heads of cattle, 25 sheep, five horses and a variety of birds, he said. 

President Buhari also has two undeveloped plots of land, one in Kano state and the other in Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers state, Shehu said. 

The statement was vague on the number of cars the president owns, saying two were bought from his savings, others supplied to him by the federal government in his capacity as former head of state and the rest donated to him by well-wishers after his jeep was damaged in bomb attack by Islamic extremists on his convoy in July 2014. 

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo's asset declaration shows he has $900,000 in bank accounts, a four-bedroom residence, a three-bedroom flat, a two-bedroom flat and a two-bedroom mortgaged property in Bedford, England, the statement said, adding that the vice president also has shareholding in six private companies based in Lagos and three cars. 

Analysts praised the move by the officials to declare their wealth. 

""The declaration represents a step in the right direction as per international standards and best practices,"" said Sylvester Atere, of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Nigeria. ""Hence, it helps to build confidence and public trust."" 

Former President Goodluck Jonathan, who lost to Buhari in the March 28 polls, declined to declare his wealth as president though he had done so as vice president during the regime of the late Umaru Yar'Adua —the first leader to declare his assets when taking office.

54d6bcea-fb51-49d7-9052-724994b04420,"A green energy company found to have made millions of marketing calls has been fined £200,000 after a ruling that it deliberately broke regulations, the  Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said. 
 
The ICO said the fine handed to Home Energy & Lifestyle Management Ltd (Helms) was the largest it has issued for nuisance calls. 

It ruled that the Glasgow-based firm breached marketing call regulations with its campaign which ""made people's lives a misery"". 

The ICO said its investigation found that Helms made more than six million calls as part of a massive automated call marketing campaign offering ""free"" solar panels. 

An organisation should have people's permission - which specifically names the company concerned - to make automated calls, but the ICO said it found this was not the case. 

In the period from October to December last year, the ICO received 242 complaints about the calls. 

One complainant said they had been waiting for news of a terminally ill family member and could not ignore the phone, and felt powerless against the automated calls. 

Another said they felt as though their home had been invaded as the answer machine filled up with calls from the company, the ICO said. 

The investigation also found that the calls were ""misleading"" because the solar panels were not necessarily free as implied by the recorded message. 

Steve Eckersley, head of enforcement at the ICO, said: ""This company's ignorance of the law is beyond belief. It didn't even bother to find out what the rules were and its badly thought-out marketing campaign made people's lives a misery. 

""The monetary penalty is for a significant amount because of the clear failings of the company, and the number of people affected by its deliberate and unlawful campaign. 

""It should be a warning to other companies to think before they launch into a campaign."" 

Home Energy & Lifestyle Management told the BBC that the campaign had stopped before the ICO investigation commenced and blamed another company for the issues raised. 

In a statement from its lawyer the company told the BBC:  ""Helms had significant difficulty in fully co-operating with the ICO, owing to the failure of the third-party company to give any information to verify and explain the extent of the calls made."" 

It said the ICO had ""seemingly disregarded"" its representations and vowed to appeal, as well as taking action against the other company. 

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said:  ""A bumper £200,000 fine by the ICO should make nuisance callers sit up and take notice. We now also need to see senior executives held personally accountable if their organisation makes unlawful calls.
