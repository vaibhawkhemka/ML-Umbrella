# Feature Pipeline

Check out [Lesson 1](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/a-framework-for-building-a-production-ready-feature-engineering-pipeline-f0b29609b20f) on Medium to better understand how we built the FE pipeline. 

Also, check out [Lesson 5](https://towardsdatascience.com/ensuring-trustworthy-ml-systems-with-data-validation-and-real-time-monitoring-89ab079f4360) to learn how we implemented the data validation layer using Great Expectations.

## Install for Development

Create virtual environment:
```shell
cd feature-pipeline
poetry shell
poetry install
```

Check the [Set Up Additional Tools](https://github.com/iusztinpaul/energy-forecasting#-set-up-additional-tools-) and [Usage](https://github.com/iusztinpaul/energy-forecasting#usage) sections to see **how to set up** the **additional tools** and **credentials** you need to run this project.

## Usage for Development

To start the ETL pipeline run:
```shell
python -m feature_pipeline.pipeline
```

To create a new feature view run:
```shell
python -m feature_pipeline.feature_view
```

**NOTE:** Be careful to complete the `.env` file and set the `ML_PIPELINE_ROOT_DIR` variable as explained in the [Set Up the ML_PIPELINE_ROOT_DIR Variable](https://github.com/iusztinpaul/energy-forecasting#set-up-the-ml_pipeline_root_dir-variable) section of the main README.
