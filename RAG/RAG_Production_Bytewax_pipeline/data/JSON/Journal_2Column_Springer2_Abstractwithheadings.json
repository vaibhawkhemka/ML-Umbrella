Journal of Ophthalmic Inflammation and Infection           (2024) 14:12   Introduction Cyclophosphamide (CP) is an alkylating agent and dis- plays a cytotoxic effect on rapidly proliferating cells  [1]. Its mechanism of action mainly inhibits the func- tioning of both T and B cells, resulting in suppression  of the immune system [2]. CP was first introduced for  the treatment of uveitis of unknown etiology in 1952  [3], and has since been utilized in the management of  various types of ocular inflammatory diseases, includ- ing Adamantiades-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease [4], Vogt-Koyan- agi-Harada (VKH) syndrome [5], ocular cicatricial  pemphigoid (OCP) [6], and peripheral ulcerative ker- atitis (PUK) [7], as well as systemic autoimmune dis- eases like granulomatosis polyangiitis [8], rheumatoid  arthritis [9], polyarteritis nodosa [10], and systemic  lupus erythematosus [11]. Though known to have  potential adverse events, including bone marrow sup- pression, hemorrhagic cystitis, and sterility, CP has  been shown to be efficacious, especially in recalcitrant  cases and when used intravenous (IV) for a limited  period [12, 13]. In recent years, ocular inflammatory diseases, includ- ing scleritis and uveitis, have been widely treated with  immunomodulatory therapies (IMTs) as a steroid-spar- ing approach. Such strategy includes conventional thera- pies (antimetabolites, alkylating agents, and calcineurin  inhibitors) as well as biologic agents like adalimumab,  infliximab, rituximab, and tocilizumab [14]. The Mul- ticenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial and  Follow-up Study has demonstrated that corticosteroid  supplemented IMTs improved visual outcomes, con- trolled inflammation, and reduced macular edema com- pared with an intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide implant  in patients with intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis,  or panuveitis [15]. In addition to successful use of con- ventional therapies, biologic agents have been increas- ingly used with promising results, especially in cases of  ocular inflammation refractory to standard therapies  [16]. Scleritis in particular is a potentially vision-threat- ening condition, and may also require IMTs, particularly  when it presents as necrotizing scleritis or associated  with systemic vasculitis [17]. Sainz de la Maza et\u00a0al. [18]  indicated that patients most often will respond to IMTs,  mainly alkylating agents like CP, if the underlying vasculi- tis is potentially lethal. Given the varying severity of these  entities, as well as challenges in treatment, management  of these patients should be tailored to each patient, based  on their clinical findings, associated underlying diseases,  and safety profile of the agent. Herein, we aimed to describe our experience on the  efficacy and safety of IV CP in treating severe ocular  inflammatory diseases in patients who failed with other  IMTs including biologic agents.  Materials and\u00a0methods Medical records of 1295 patients who presented to  the Uveitis Clinic at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford  between 2017 and 2022 were retrospectively reviewed  using the Stanford Research Repository (STARR) tool.  Seven patients (10 eyes) who received CP therapy for  severe ocular inflammatory diseases with at least one  year of follow-up were identified and included in the  study. Data review included demographics of patients,  ocular findings, underlying systemic diseases, previous  and concomitant therapies, total treatment duration,  treatment outcomes, adverse events, and total follow-up  time. Remission was defined as the absence of active ocu- lar inflammation with or without therapy and was docu- mented based on the clinical exam and imaging findings  depending on the presence of scleral or intraocular  inflammation. Any recurrence of ocular inflammation  (that is anterior chamber or vitreous cells; inflammatory  changes with redness on slit lamp examination; pres- ence of vascular leakage of optic disc/vessels on fluores- cein angiography), as well as associated comorbidities  and complications during the follow-up period were also  recorded. The present study was approved by the Stanford Uni- versity Institutional Review Board and followed the  Helsinki Declaration tenets, the United States Code of  Federal Regulations Title 21, and the Harmonized Tripar- tite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (1996). Each  patient signed a written informed consent. SPSS 25[dot]0  (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used in the statistical  analysis.  Results The mean age of the patients (4 male and 3 female) was  61[dot]6\u2009\u00b1\u200914[dot]9 (range, 43[dot]0\u201389[dot]0) years. Clinical diagno- ses included necrotizing scleritis (5 eyes of 4 patients),  peripheral ulcerative keratitis (2 eyes of 1 patients),  orbital pseudotumor (1 eye of 1 patient), HLA-B27  associated panuveitis and retinal vasculitis (2 eyes of 1  patient). Ocular disease was idiopathic in 3 patients, and  was associated with rheumatoid arthritis, IgG-4 scleros- ing disease, dermatomyositis, and ankylosing spondyli- tis in 1 patient each (Table\u00a01). All patients had history of  previous IMT use. Previous IMTs included methotrex- ate (5 patients), mycophenolate mofetil (3 patients), aza- thioprine (1 patient), tacrolimus (1 patient), adalimumab  (2 patients), infliximab (4 patients), and rituximab (1  patient). The mean total follow-up time was 32[dot]6\u2009\u00b1\u200911[dot]6  (13\u201345) months. CP therapy was given as IV infusions at the dose of  1\u00a0g/m2\u00a0of body surface area every 3 to 4\u00a0weeks (pending  schedules of the patients). IV CP infusions were preferred",

At the time of CP  initiation, all biologics were discontinued 4\u20136\u00a0 weeks in  advance. CP therapy was planned to be continued until  the ocular inflammation got into remission. In addition,  IV methylprednisolone (MP) at the dose of 750\u20131000\u00a0mg  for 1\u20133\u00a0days monthly was given to augment the immu- nomodulatory effect of IV CP therapy on the day of IV  CP infusion \u00ad (1st day) and the subsequent days \u00ad (2nd and   \u00ad 3rd day of the month) accordingly. Patients were closely  monitored for any possible adverse events. Baseline com- plete blood count and complete metabolic panel and uri- nalysis were performed and repeated every two months  during the follow-up of each patient. White blood cell  count (WBC) was monitored to guide dose adjustment,  and was tolerated down to 3[dot]0 to 4[dot]5\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 109 cells/L. In  cases of lower WBC levels, CP therapy was held until the  WBC count returned to normal range level. The patients  were also hydrated adequately to wash out potential   toxic metabolites from the urogenital system. Trimetho- prim sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis was initiated (3 times  weekly) to reduce the risk of opportunistic infections. The mean duration of CP therapy was 10[dot]9\u2009\u00b1\u20097[dot]5 (range,  5\u201328) months. Median visual acuity (VA) at the initia- tion of IV CP therapy was 20/50 (range; 20/400 \u2013 20/20).  Inflammation improved in all patients. Complete remis- sion was achieved in five patients (71[dot]4%). One patient  achieved resolution of disease but continues CP while  waiting for surgical intervention, and another patient  had a flare of his scleritis and was restarted on CP ther- apy, leading to stabilization of the disease. Four patients  (62[dot]5%) experienced leukopenia with the lowest WBC  level at 2[dot]2\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 109 cells/L. Among them, the dose of CP  therapy was required to be reduced to 750\u00a0mg/m2 of body  surface area per month in one patient along with the use  of pegfilgrastim during the CP infusions. One patient  had to skip four CP infusions until his WBC recovered  to normal range.

One patient tol- erated CP infusions without any adverse events. Among  the six patients who successfully discontinued IV CP  therapy during the follow-up, two patients had persistent  borderline WBC levels with lack of opportunistic infec- tions, whereas the adverse events were reversible in the  remaining patients. Following the discontinuation of IV CP therapy, four  patients were successfully maintained on mycopheno- late mofetil (2000 \u2013 3000\u00a0mg/daily) and one patient on  methotrexate (15\u00a0 mg weekly) therapy. One patient was  initiated on infliximab (10\u00a0mg/kg monthly) therapy given  continued systemic disease activity. Associated comorbidities and complications noted  during the follow-up period included glaucoma in seven  eyes of six (75%) patients which required tube shunt  implantation in 3 (37[dot]5%) eyes, scleral patch grafting in 3  (27[dot]3%) eyes of two patients due to advanced scleral thin- ning, tarsorrhaphy in 2 (18[dot]2%) eyes of two patients, and  conjunctivoplasty in one (9[dot]1%) eye of one patient. Visual  acuity (VA) improved in 4 (36[dot]4%) eyes of three patients  and maintained in 5 (45[dot]5%) eyes of four patients during  the follow-up. Two eyes of two patients showed deterio- ration in VA due to vascularized cornea in one eye and  cataract development in the other eye. Median VA at the  final follow-up was 20/50 (range; 20/400 \u2013 20/20).  Discussion The index study shows that IV CP therapy is an effica- cious treatment choice with an acceptable safety profile  in patients with severe ocular inflammatory diseases  who failed with other IMTs including biologic agents.  All patients in the study population responded to IV  CP therapy, 71[dot]4% of whom had complete remission of  disease activity by the end of follow-up. This was espe- cially conspicuous considering the presence of rapidly  progressive, severe ocular inflammation and the failure  with other IMTs including biologic agents. All patients  had history of previous IMT use, and five (71[dot]4%) of  whom had received [3]1 biologic agent before initiation  of IV CP. Two (25%) patients (3 eyes) had previously used  both adalimumab and infliximab. One patient had scle- ritis which was refractory to rituximab but was finally  controlled following 5 cycles of IV CP therapy. The most  seen adverse event was decreased WBC levels, which was  largely reversible in the study population. And though, in  this setting of severe, destructive inflammation, the pri- mary goal was preservation of the structural integrity of  the globe, many patients benefited from stable, and even  improved visual acuity.  Intravenous CP was first used in ophthalmic inflamma- tion by Wong et\u00a0al. [20] and then also shown to be effec- tive in Adamantiades-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease [21] and severe  refractory uveitis [22]. It has several advantages over  oral CP, including faster control of severe ocular inflam- mation, usually transient (rather than permanent) leu- kopenia, and reduced risk of toxicity (as it bypasses the  bladder), enabling larger doses [13]. Nonetheless, poten- tial adverse events should be carefully considered when  choosing patients to receive this therapy. In the index  study, no patients clinically experienced sterility, devel- oped cancer, nor had any fatalities related to IV CP use,  though it should be noted that the follow up period was  relatively short. However, as with making any clinical  decision, risks must be weighed against the benefits, and  in cases of severe, refractory vision-threatening inflam- mation, utilization of IV CP therapy should be con- sidered, given the potential for achieving an otherwise  elusive remission. And, as proposed by the European  League against Rheumatism in order to decrease the risk  of toxicity further [23] providers also have the option to  switch to a maintenance regimen with a milder side effect  profile once remission is achieved. Biologic agents have been indicated as an effective  treatment option for non-infectious ocular inflamma- tion, including refractory uveitis and scleritis [24\u201326]. In  a multicenter study of 34 patients with severe and refrac- tory PUK, 48% of the patients treated with TNF-alpha  inhibitors were required switching to another biologic  agent, while no switching was needed in those receiving  non-TNF-alpha agents like rituximab and tocilizumab  [27]. Rituximab, a fully humanized monoclonal anti- CD20 antibody, has been demonstrated as an efficacious  and safe therapy for refractory uveitis or scleritis with  potential relapse of disease following discontinuation of  treatment [28]. Sharma et\u00a0al. [29] recently reported on an  8-year real-world prospective analysis showing that TNF- alpha inhibitors successfully induced sustained remission  in 91% of patients with sustained steroid-sparing effect in  75% of the patients with uveitis or scleritis. On the other  hand, 51% of patients experienced at least one relapse  of inflammation during the follow-up. They emphasized  that, despite success with TNF-alpha inhibitors, wider  treatment options are necessary, as well as further assess- ment of which uveitic entities respond best, in order to  optimize outcomes. Therefore, IV CP therapy should  always be kept in our armamentarium as an alternative  therapeutic option and may be utilized for a short term  in order to achieve swift control of ocular inflammation,  particularly in patients with severe, rapidly progressive  disease which has failed with other IMTs. The present study is informative as it demonstrates the  efficacy of IV CP profile in the management of severe",

There are some  limitations of the study including the retrospective  design, small sample size with relatively short follow- up period considering the adverse events like cancer  development and associated mortality. In addition, as  being the tertiary center setting, the patients usually had  severe and resistant ocular inflammation. In addition, all  patients received IV MP along with IV CP therapy dur- ing follow-up periods. Certainly, MP can also contribute  to the improvement of the ocular inflammation. How- ever, prior to IV CP therapy, patients were also receiving  IV MP (at the similar dose of 750\u20131000\u00a0mg for 1\u20133\u00a0days  monthly) during their therapy course with other biologics  such as IFX and RTX. Thus, the confounding effect of MP  would be irrelevant considering the patients had already  failed with prior therapy. In addition, patients who were  successfully discontinued IV CP therapy, were also dis- continued IV MP therapy at the same time and contin- ued to be followed up with antimetabolites in 5 patients  (6 eyes) and IFX only in 1 patient (1 eye) (given active  systemic disease). Considering short term pulse effect of  IV MP therapy with no role in immunomodulation, this  remission of disease may likely be attributed to IV CP  therapy itself. Moreover,\u00a0we have observed clinically that  MP alone often does not lead to remission in eyes with  severe or refractory ocular inflammation. Hence, we have  employed IV CP and added IV MP to achieve synergis- tic effects as also previously described in the literature  [30]. Importantly, long term treatment of these patients  should not include high-dose corticosteroids, given its  side effects. In conclusion, IV CP therapy may be considered a poten- tially effective treatment option with a relatively acceptable  safety profile for patients with severe ocular inflammatory  diseases who failed with other IMTs including biologic  agents (TNFa and CD20 inhibitors). Close monitoring  with regular blood work is essential for the management  of these patients, as leukopenia was the most common  adverse event. Judicious use of IV CP appears favorable for  severe, resistant ocular inflammation particularly when the  potentially vision-saving benefits outweigh the substantial  potential side effects of therapy.
