CA performance prediction (CAPP) metrics are novel tools that address the problem of appropriate CA selection. However, most CAPP metrics depend upon a variety of factors such as the WMN topology, the type of CA scheme, and connectedness of the underlying graph. In this work, we propose an improved Channel Assignment Link-Weight Metric (iCALM) that is independent of these constraints. To the best of our knowl- edge, iCALM is the frst universal CAPP metric for WMNs. To evaluate iCALM, we design two WMN topologies that conform to the attributes of real-world mesh network de- ployments, and run rigorous simulations in ns-3. We com- pareiCALM tofour existing CAPP metrics, and demonstrate that it performs exceedingly well, regardless of the CA type, and the WMN layout.

Con- sequently, substantial research efort is focused on mitigat- ing and restraining its adverse impact through efcient Chan- nel Allocation (CA) schemes [1, 2]. But having a multitude of CA schemes, without a robust framework to accurately predict CA performance makes CA selection for a particular WMN a rather tedious and resource intensive task. Several CA performance prediction (CAPP) metrics have been pro- posed in the research literature for example TID,CDALcost,CXLSwt [3\u20135]. Channel Assignment Link Weight Metric (CALM) pro- posed in [6] is a CAPP metric inspired by social theory, em- ploying the Durkheimian concept of a sui generis social re- ality. CALM is a non-confict-graph interference estimation heuristic which generates Link-Weights (LW) that refect the impact of interference on link quality. Further, CALM accu- rately determines the suitability of a CA scheme for a given WMN. CALM LWs are utilized by NETCAP, a Mixed Inte- ger Programming heuristic, to predict the expected WMN capacity. CALM borrows ideas from social theory by mak- ing use of a Sociological Idea Borrowing Mechanism (SIBM), based on cybernetic hierarchy. Authors validate the efcacy of CALM throughextensive simulations in ns-3, demonstrat- ing accuracy of over 90%, which far exceeds that of TID, CDALcost and CXLSwt. However, CALM estimates can only be used to compare CA schemes designed for a specifc WMN layout, and not across diferent WMN topologies. Thus, for CALM based CA selection, prior knowledge of the WMN topology is a nec- essary prerequisite. Further, simulations to validate CALM were carried out only on planned grid WMN topologies that do not resemble real-world communication networks. The motivations of this work are two-fold. First, we extend  Poster Presentation MobiCom\u201918, October 29\u2013November 2, 2018, New Delhi, India  702",

      "text": "the research problem by attempting to compare expected performance of CA schemes designed for diferent WMN topologies. The objective is to ofer more leeway to a WMN administrator by doing away with the constraint of a fxed WMN topology, as certain CA schemes may involve topol- ogy modifcation for enhanced performance. To achieve the objective of topological universality, we re-design the CALM algorithm and propose the Improved Channel Assignment Link Weight Metric (iCALM). Second, we carefully design two planned WMN (PWMN) layouts that conform to topo- logical properties of real-world WMN deployments, and in- vestigate performance of CALM, iCALM and NETCAP in the simulated PWMNs.

We design two PWMNs of 25 nodes and 50 nodes labelled PWMN25 and PWMN50, spread over a simulated deployment area of 1000m \u00d7 1000m and 1500m\u00d71500m,and illustrated in Figure 1 (a) and Figure 1 (b), respectively. The two PWMNs conform to several impor- tant topological properties of actual wireless network de- ployments, as depicted in Table 1 [7]. The global parameters that we consider are Network Density (\u03b4), Radius or Minimal Eccentricity (\u03b5min), and Transitivity or Clustering Coefcient (T).  3 IMPROVED CHANNEL ASSIGNMENT LINK-WEIGHT METRIC TheiCALM computationis presented in Algorithm 1. It takes Link-Weights generated by CALM as input and creates an estimate which is independent of topology. We will demon- strate through results that CALM values of CAs designed  for diferent WMN topologies cannot be successfully com- pared. However any CA for any WMN layout can be fed as input to Algorithm 1, and the resulting iCALM estimates can be compared regardless of the CA type and the WMN topology. Thus, iCALM does away with the topology speci- fcity of CALM, while maintaining high accuracy. Further, as CALM serves as the preliminary phase for iCALM, the Link-Weights are available to NETCAP to generate an esti- mate of expected WMN capacity.

We run simulations on ns- 3 based on the parameters depicted in Figure 2 (a). We then correlate theoretical estimates of iCALM with the observed Network Aggregate Throughput (NAT) of CA schemes for each individual PWMN topology,and both PWMNs together to assess topology independence. Observed correlation is il- lustrated in Figures 2 (b), 2 (c), & 2 (d). We also implement the three CAPP metrics viz, TID, CDALcost, and CXLSwt, for both PWMNs to compare their performance to CALM and iCALM. We determine the Errors in Sequence (EIS) by comparing the CA sequence based on observed NAT val- ues (Reference Sequence) with CA sequences generated by theoretical CAPP metrics. Then, we compute the Measure of Accuracy (MoA) determined by the expression MoA = (1 \u2212(EIS/nC2)) \u00d7 100, where n is the number of CAs in the sequence. The MoA (as a %) of all fve CAPP metrics consid- ered in our work is presented in Table 2.  4[dot]2 Evaluation and Future Work  The CAPP metrics can be ordered in terms of improving overall performanceas :TID <CDALcost <CXLSwt <CALM  Poster Presentation MobiCom\u201918, October 29\u2013November 2, 2018, New Delhi, India  703",

Observations in simulated PWMNs are similar to those recorded in grid WMNs [6], which further validates the accuracy of CALM. TID, CDALcost, and CXLSwt con- tinue to perform poorly when we consider graph preserv- ing CA schemes that may alter WMN topology, while per- formance of CALM is not efected by the type of CA cho- sen. However, in the topology agnostic assessment of CA schemes, all four existing metrics, including CALM, are found wanting. The necessary prerequisite of WMN topologyplaces constraints upon an administrator during CA selection.iCALM overcomes this constraint, by ofering the ability to compare expected performance of CAs regardless of the WMNs they are designed for. Despite the increased complexity of the re- search problem, iCALM registers an accuracy of 84%, while other CAPP metrics fail the test of reliability. Also, even in topology specifc CA comparisons, iCALM ofers accuracy equivalent to that of CALM. Thus, it maintains the accu- racy of CALM despite universalizing the WMN topological domain over which CA schemes may be compared. The expected network capacity predicted by NETCAP using CALM estimates is evaluated against the observed NAT re- sults, and presented in Figures 3 (a), & 3 (b). The average deviation from observed NAT values is marginal, calculated to be 3[dot]36% for PWMN50, and a meager 1[dot]85% for PWMN25. We plan to improve upon iCALM design through new ideas from social-theory for example structural hole theory, and ap- ply iCALM to mobile mesh and adhoc networks.
