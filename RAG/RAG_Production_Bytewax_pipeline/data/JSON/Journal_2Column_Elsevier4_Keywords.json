DED has  been broadly implemented in the design and fabrication of novel materials. These include metals, ceramics, and  composites. Successful DED operation requires a good understanding of many critical phenomena, including  laser-material interactions, fundamentals of casting and solidification of alloys, welding metallurgy and joining  interfaces, along with microstructure-mechanical properties relations. Also critical are powder flowability, heat  transfer, and various machine-related parameters. Several review articles have been published in recent years on  metal AM via powder bed fusion (PBF) and DED, focusing on either a specific material system, mapping the  recent technologies for AM, or issues related to the deposition process or material properties. Yet, no recent  review is dedicated to a comprehensive presentation of material systems, design, fabrication, challenges, and the  relationship between microstructures and mechanical properties of various DED\u2019ed material families. Since the  DED-based approach is becoming popular to manufacture bimetallic and multi-material structures, repair high-  value structures, and alloy design, this comprehensive review focuses on materials design via DED, including a  survey of a variety of monolithic and multi-material compositions. Finally, the critical challenges and oppor\u00ad tunities in this area are highlighted.     1. Introduction   Additive manufacturing (AM), often called three-dimensional (3D)  printing, allows for the rapid, on-demand fabrication of near-net-shape  components directly from a computer-aided design (CAD) file without  any part-specific tooling. Recently, it was identified among the twelve  disruptive technologies driving the fourth industrial revolution [1].  Although AM started as a rapid prototyping tool for \u201ctouch and feel\u201d  parts, it is mainstream manufacturing now for various industries [2]. AM  machines make 3D parts from a digital model by progressively depos\u00ad iting materials in a \u2018layer-by-layer\u2019 approach [3]. Subsequent in\u00ad novations in AM technologies have expanded the variety of printed  materials from polymers to metals, ceramics, composites, and even  living tissues [4\u20136]. The integration of advanced automation and ro\u00ad botics in AM has helped reduce manufacturing variance, fabricating  large and complex structures with high quality and repeatability. The  unique features of AM, such as the ability to form complex geometries   with topological optimization, enable innovative product design and  freeform fabrication of lightweight components. A low \u201cbuy-to-fly\u201d  ratio, that is the mass of the input raw material divided by the output part,  reduces the production cost and time. These inherent advantages of AM  have attracted the attention of the aerospace, biomedical, automotive,  and consumer product industries [7,8].  From 2010 onwards, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has been approving AM processed parts for human use, and in 2013 the  US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved a fuel nozzle, the  first metal AM part for a critical jet engine application, manufactured by  the General Electric Company [9]. In 2013, the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration (NASA) installed the first polymers AM ma\u00ad chine at the International Space Station (ISS). These events boosted the  confidence of AM processed products in various industrial sectors, and  enhanced the growth of this field. Not surprisingly, over the last 15  years, there has been a rapid increase in the intensity of research and  development (R&D) activities related to metal AM, both in academia   * Corresponding author.

Metal AM was boosted in 1994 when Electro Optical Systems (EOS)  printed a metal part in a direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) machine  [5]. The laser powder-based directed energy deposition (DED) technique  was invented at the Sandia National Laboratories in the US and is called  laser engineered net shaping (LENS\u2122). In 1997, the LENS\u2122 technology  was licensed to Optomec\u00ae, Inc. (Albuquerque, NM) [10]. Over the  years, other companies also started selling laser powder-based DED  machines worldwide due to limited patent protection in the core tech\u00ad nology. Hybrid AM machines with DED technology and wire and arc  additive manufacturing (WAAM, also known as DED-arc) machines with  filament feeding also add new dimensions to this market segment.  DED processes generally use powder or wire as the feedstock and  laser/electron beam/arc as the energy source. The concentrated energy  source melts the feedstock at a particular point and creates a melt pool,  generally shielded with an inert atmosphere. Like any other AM process,  DED also uses a computer-aided design (CAD) model to deposit the   feedstock material (for example powder or wire) in a layer-by-layer fashion  [11]. The most frequently used metal AM processes are PBF and DED  (Fig. 2a and b, respectively). While PBF commonly has higher dimen\u00ad sional accuracy and yields parts with lower surface roughness [11,12],  DED has multiple unique advantages over PBF (Fig. 2c\u2013f): (1) DED en\u00ad ables higher deposition rates (up to 2[dot]5 kg/h for DED versus 0[dot]25 kg/h  for PBF [13]); (2) DED has an inherent capability for multi-material  deposition (for example in situ alloying [14]) and fabrication of functionally  graded structures with location-specific properties [15,16]; (3) DED  systems can be adapted to the processing of coatings/cladding [17,18]  and repair of damaged parts [19,20]; (4) DED enables processing of  large (>1000 mm3) part volumes [21]; and (5) 5+ axes in DED systems  allow layers to deposit in any direction.  Among different metal DED processes, powder-based feedstock with  laser beam as the energy source is the most commonly studied process.  Fig. 3 shows schematic diagrams of laser-based DED for powder and  wire-based feedstock, whose characteristics have recently been  compared [12]. Commercially available metal wires are cheaper than   Fig. 1. Trends in metal AM research and intellectual property.

However, increased laser power is required to melt the metal  wires, thus leading to the higher price of wire-feed laser DED systems.  While DED in its core principles is like welding, it presents various  unique technical and scientific challenges [24]. Thus, the knowledge  established based on welding metallurgy could be helpful to improve the  DED processes with controlled microstructure and process repeatability  [25]. Combining different welding methods with AM broadens the po\u00ad tential of AM technology for large-scale manufacturing. Welding-based  AM processes such as laser metal deposition with wire (LMD-W), elec\u00ad tron beam AM (EBAM), and WAAM are capable of depositing large-scale  components at low production cost [24]. Specifically, the WAAM pro\u00ad cess has attracted more interest in the aerospace industry for fabricating  high-strength aluminum structures due to its high deposition rate and  flexibility in producing large structures [26]. High cooling rates of up to  10 5K/s [27] combined with the layer-by-layer deposition of DED pro\u00ad cessing that subjects the material to unique thermal cycles can lead to  both complex phase transformations [28] and the formation of detri\u00ad mental residual stresses [29]. The macrostructure and microstructure of  the as-deposited material are controlled by the thermal history in the  DED process. These may influence the mechanical and physical prop\u00ad erties of the as-deposited parts [12]. In situ monitoring, process opti\u00ad mization, and feedback control are reported to minimize defects  associated with the DED process and improve part quality [12]. Com\u00ad mercial DED systems are available from various vendors worldwide.  Most DED machines are still open-loop systems. Although the basic  operation principle remains the same, each vendor adds special features   for its unit. The free-axis or six-axis of freedom deposition heads are  becoming common to print on any surface and add-on features on  existing parts as well as printing of large freestanding parts. For powder  deposition, nozzle coaxial feed improves deposition efficiency and has  become popular in many systems. Finally, melt-pool sensors (MPS) are  also helpful to understand and control metal deposition.  Several review articles have been published in recent years on metal  AM via PBF and DED [12,27,30\u201335]. Yet, it appears that no recent  comprehensive review has been dedicated to a broad presentation of  material systems, material design, fabrication, challenges, and the  relationship between microstructures and mechanical properties of a  variety of material families. The objective of this review is thus to pro\u00ad vide a comprehensive analysis of materials deposited via DED, including  monolithic-, bimetallic-, and multi-material systems. These materials  include titanium alloys, steels, aluminum alloys, nickel alloys, cobalt  alloys, intermetallics, shape memory alloys (SMAs), high-entropy alloys  (HEAs), ceramics, composites, FGMs, and multilayered materials.  Emphasis is placed on the relationships between DED process parame\u00ad ters, microstructures, and resulting mechanical properties of the printed  components. Alloy design, freedom structure deposition, material  cladding and repair by DED are also discussed. Finally, the critical  challenges and opportunities in this area are highlighted.   2.

Such interest by leading industries,  including the automotive, aerospace, military, and biomedical, leads to  significant investments in studying various materials for AM. This sec\u00ad tion reviews materials that were recently reported to be processed via  DED technology. The effect of processing parameters on microstructure  and mechanical properties of the processed materials are discussed,  emphasizing the current scientific and technological gaps for designing  industry-reliable engineering components. To date, various materials  have been processed via DED technology, with varying levels of success.  This list of materials may be divided into two main groups: (1)  commonly studied AM materials, such as titanium-based alloys, alloy  steels, stainless steels, tool steels, nickel-based alloys, and aluminum-  based alloys; and (2) novel AM materials, such as cobalt-based alloys,  intermetallics, SMAs, HEAs, ceramics, composites, and FGMs. Relevant  references, only some of which will be further discussed in this review  article, are listed in Table 1. Naturally, no single review can cover every  materials system, as this would fall outside the scope of covering sig\u00ad nificant findings and align them with results for important structural  alloys. Thus, some material systems, for example Mg- and Cu-based alloys, will  not be discussed herein.   2[dot]1. Alloy steels   Alloy steels contain between 1[dot]0 and 50 wt% alloying elements and  are widely used as structural materials in the automotive, marine, pe\u00ad troleum, and chemical industries. They offer high strength and good  ductility, along with excellent wear and corrosion resistance [31]. Alloy  steels can be formed via various forming and joining operations [542,  543]. Manufacturing in a low oxygen environment can improve the  mechanical properties of alloy steel parts [543] Naturally, AM of alloy  steels is being practiced at different industries, and is a rapidly growing  research field.  Most commonly, the phrase \u201calloy steel\u201d is used regarding low-alloy  steels, which are generally defined as iron-carbon alloys with the sum of  alloying elements between 1[dot]0 and 4[dot]0 wt%. The addition of alloying  elements improves the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance  compared to conventional carbon steels [543]. To date, various  low-alloy steels have been successfully processed by DED [544]. Guan  et al [36] studied the effect of energy density on the resulting micro\u00ad structure, deposit density, and mechanical properties (Fig. 4a) of  DED\u2019ed 12CrNi2Y steel. A local maximum of relative density of 98[dot]95%  was achieved within the used set of energy densities. DED-processed  parts transformed from polygonal ferrite at lower energy densities to  granular bainite at higher energy densities. The increase in energy  density at a threshold value resulted in a reduced cooling rate and grain  coarsening (Fig. 4a). Fang et al [68] studied the microstructure, me\u00ad chanical, and corrosion properties of DED\u2019ed FeCrNiMnMoNbSi steel. It  was shown that the microstructure consisted of homogenously distrib\u00ad uted elements with nano-scale lath spacing of martensitic phase and   minor amounts of nano-polycrystalline precipitates (Fig. 4b). Concern\u00ad ing yield strength and elongation, the as-deposited material met the  standard of the wrought precipitation-hardened (PH) stainless steel base  material (Fig. 4b). The additions of Cr resulted in enhanced corrosion  resistance of the as-deposited alloy compared to the FV520B stainless  steel.  Liu et al [42] studied the DED of ultrahigh-strength 300M steel.  Ultrahigh-strength steels are commonly defined as steels with yield  strength higher than 1380 MPa (200 ksi). The high Si content in the  300M steel provides higher hardenability depth, higher solid-solution  hardening, and higher resistance to softening at elevated temperatures  compared to the AISI 4340 steel. The microstructure of the as-deposited  steel consisted of tempered martensite, retained austenite, and finely  dispersed carbides. Microstructure evolution at the heat-affected zone  (HAZ) and its dependence on the thermal cycling associated with the  DED process were also reported, see Fig. 4c. DED was also utilized to  deposit 24CrNiMo steel [57]. Experimental observations and simula\u00ad tions were employed to study the microstructural transformation  mechanism corresponding to the simulated cooling rate and tempera\u00ad ture distribution at the melt pool area (Fig. 4d). Grain morphology  analysis revealed columnar grains with a strong <100> texture along  the deposit\u2019s surface, and random crystal orientation in the bulk of the  deposit. This difference between the surface and the bulk microstructure  was ascribed to the inherent thermal cycling during DED, which resulted  in tempering effects.   2[dot]2. Tool steels   Tool steels are used to fabricate tools for cutting, forming, or shaping  materials. The material should withstand high loads at high speeds  without fracture or undergoing substantial deformation. These steels  typically contain relatively high concentrations of carbide formers such  as Cr, Mn, V, Mo, and W, and C concentration in the range of 0[dot]6\u20131[dot]3 wt  % [542,543].  The inherent rapid solidification process and high thermal gradients  associated with the DED-LB process were reported to affect the as-  deposited material\u2019s microstructure and mechanical properties, partic\u00ad ularly notable in the case of wrought tool steels [545]. Park et al [545]  studied the effect of laser energy density on the properties of  as-deposited AISI H13 and D2 tool steels. A reduction in the average  microhardness with increased energy density was reported for both  steels. This phenomenon was explained by the apparent increase in  secondary dendrite arm spacing and reduced carbon content due to CO  formation. Baek et al [69] reported the DED-LB processing of AISI H13  and M2 alloys. A refined microstructure with a fine cellular dendritic  structure was observed, enhancing microhardness. The M2 deposited  sample exhibited superior wear properties than the commercial  heat-treated D2 steel with Cr-rich carbides (see Ref. [69] for  heat-treatment specification). This was explained by the high content of  carbides in the as-deposited M2 alloy. Rahman et al [546] studied the  microstructure and mechanical properties of two novel DED-LB high-\u00ad carbon,  high-speed  steels  (HC  HSS)  \u2013  Febal-C-Cr-Mo-V  and  Febal\u2212x-C-Cr-Mo-V-Wx. The microstructure of both steels consisted of a  martensite matrix with retained austenite and inter-dendritic networks  of primary, secondary, and eutectic metal carbides (Fig. 5a). A formation  of an oxide layer on the surface and higher carbide density was observed  in the steel alloyed with W, which resulted in enhanced wear resistance  (Fig. 5a). Tensile tests after tempering treatment showed a brittle nature  of the fracture surfaces.  Baek et al [83] studied the effect of substrate preheating on the  microstructure and mechanical properties of AISI M4 tool steel. It was  shown that by increasing the substrate preheating temperature, the  cooling rate decreased, resulting in reduced residual stress, increased  hardness, but decreased tensile and impact strengths. Zhao et al [79]  studied the effect of the deposition methodology on the microstructure  and mechanical properties of H13 tool steel. It was shown that the   Table 1  Selected publications on different material systems deposited by DED.

The addition of time intervals in between successively deposited  layers and a change in applied laser power or a combination of the two  resulted in distinct thermal histories, which caused variations in  microstructure and mechanical properties along with the deposit height  (Fig. 5b). DED-LB of high carbon AISI M4 steel and high-wear-resistant  steel (HWS) were also demonstrated [75]. The influence of post-heat  treatment (quenching followed by tempering, see Ref. [75] for heat  treatment specifications) on the microstructure and mechanical prop\u00ad erties, including hardness, impact, and wear characteristics, were also  reported. Fig. 5c shows the results of the wear analysis of the wear scars   on as-deposited M4 and HWS steels and the wear characteristics before  and after heat treatment. To sum up, it is clear that DED-LB is a viable  option to manufacture tool steels; however, processing parameters  significantly influence the microstructures and mechanical properties of  the components. Moreover, post-process heat treatments are highly  recommended to minimize residual stresses.   2[dot]3.

Such alloys are widely used in  structural applications requiring a combination of corrosion resistance,  strength, and ductility [543]. In this section, only few austenitic and  precipitation-hardened stainless steels shall be discussed. Information  on DED of ferritic and martensitic stainless steels is available in many  references, some of which are listed in Table 1. In general, AM pro\u00ad cessing of stainless steels is challenging due to their high Cr content. The  high oxygen affinity of Cr results in significant oxidation during  laser-based deposition [549]. However, controlling the oxygen con\u00ad centration to a few ppm in the deposition chamber during the DED  process can overcome this challenge. Several studies have shown strong  influence of processing parameters on the stainless steel microstructure  evolution during DED [88,89,92,93,95,99\u2013106,108,110,114,116,117,  124,125,131,149]. The high thermal gradients, dynamic melt pool flow,  and the rapid solidification associated with the non-uniform repetitive  layer-by-layer deposition process result in a unique hierarchical and  heterogeneous microstructure. Such microstructure is characterized by   epitaxial growth of columnar grains in various orientations through the  prior deposited layer boundaries (Fig. 6a) [125]. The influence of build  height was also studied. It was shown that as the build height increases,  the thermal gradient and cooling rate decrease. This results in the  coarsening of the grain structure [99,101,149].  Yang et al [103] measured the microhardness of as-deposited 316L  austenitic stainless steel (the \u201cL\" designation in stainless steels stands for  low carbon, that is less than 0[dot]03 wt%, to prevent sensitization and in\u00ad crease the corrosion resistance). An increase of around 35% in micro\u00ad hardness compared to the wrought counterpart was observed. This  increase was related to the fine microstructure of the DED-LB steel  compared to the wrought steel. However, large variations in the  measured microhardness were reported. These variations were related  to the heterogeneous microstructure of the as-deposited steel, which  included interpass deposition cells, inclusion pores, and HAZ, all of  which are characterized by distinct microhardness values. The tensile  properties of DED stainless steels have been extensively studied [88,89,   Fig. 6.

It  was  shown that there is a strong influence of the deposition orientation on  the tensile properties [89,93,99,117,119]. The variations in tensile  properties of samples with distinct orientations are associated with  variations in thermal history during the deposition process, as the  cooling rate is highly affected by the thermal gradient, and consequently  \u2013 by deposition height. It was shown that hot isostatic pressing (HIP)  enhances the tensile properties due to reduced porosity and residual  stresses [119]. Balit et al [138] studied the microstructure and tensile  properties of as-deposited thin-wall DED-LB 316L for repair applica\u00ad tions. A good correlation was found between the measured grain size  and the analyzed mean axial strains using an in situ digital image cor\u00ad relation (DIC) combined with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)  analysis, Fig. 6b. Gordon et al [131] studied the fatigue properties of  as-deposited 304L SS (stainless steel) fabricated by gas metal arc weld\u00ad ing, DED-arc, in the high-cycle fatigue (HCF) loading regime. It was  shown that fatigue life is highly governed by the inherent anisotropy,  preferred grain growth orientation, and porosity in the as-deposited  steel. The study showed that the fatigue properties are similar or supe\u00ad rior to those of wrought 304L SS. This is in good agreement with other  studies of the fatigue properties of stainless steels fabricated by DED-LB  [126,127].  The damage tolerance and crack propagation mechanisms of as-  deposited stainless steels in the horizontal and vertical orientations  were studied [131,550]. In vertical samples, the crack propagation path  was transgranular. In samples with horizontal orientation, crack  branching and propagation along grain boundaries were evident  (Fig. 6c). Smith et al [127] reported that the fatigue performance of  as-deposited 304L SS was highly dependent on defects in the  as-deposited steel. It was shown that superior fatigue properties were  achieved when the number of defects was minimized. The fatigue  cracks\u2019 origin was characterized by areas of irregular shape  lack-of-fusion (LoF) defects with partly meted trapped powder particles.  Fig. 6d illustrates the effect of oxygen content on the elongation of  as-deposited 316L. It is evident that the deposition pattern (either 67\u25e6or  90\u25e6in between successive layers) directly affects the resulting thermal  history and the distance from the substrate, which in turn results in  variations in the primary cellular arm spacing (PCAS).  Precipitation hardened (PH) steels are Fe\u2013Cr\u2013Ni alloys with low  carbon content (less than 0[dot]1 wt%) containing precipitate-forming ele\u00ad ments such as Cu, Al, Ti, Nb, and Ta. They can be either austenitic or  martensitic in their annealed condition. PH steel parts require a unique  set of properties. Among others, such attributes include high strength,  high corrosion resistance, oxidation resistance, as well as excellent heat  and fire resistance. PH steel parts are utilized as structural materials in  various applications, including marine structures, gas turbines for  aircraft, fuel tanks, hydraulic systems, fasteners, and nuclear power  plants. To date, relatively little work has been carried out on the DED-LB  of 17\u20134 PH (AISI 630) by LENS\u2122 [120,145,551]. It has been shown that  the inherent raw powder porosity has a more significant effect on the  resulted intralayer porosity than the applied deposition conditions  [120]. Utilizing ultrasonic vibration during the deposition process  improved the hardness and tensile properties of the as-deposited parts.  These were ascribed to the effect of ultrasonic vibration in increasing the  powder catchment efficiency, reducing the surface roughness,  increasing the melt pool dimensions, porosity, reducing micro-cracking,  and refining the grain size [551].   2[dot]4. Titanium alloys   Titanium (Ti) alloys are of interest in aerospace, automotive, naval,  and biomedical applications [542,543,552\u2013555] due to their high spe\u00ad cific strength, exceptional corrosion resistance, high fracture toughness,  excellent fatigue resistance, good mechanical properties at elevated  temperatures (up to 450 \u25e6C), low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE),  and good biocompatibility. However, Ti and its alloys have poor   machinability, low thermal conductivity [556] and are more chal\u00ad lenging to cold work than other alloys due to their low Young\u2019s modulus  and high yield strength. Moreover, Ti alloys show poor machinability  and have a very high affinity towards oxygen; naturally, Ti alloys are  challenging to manufacture via traditional techniques, such as  machining and casting [542,557]. Therefore, AM of Ti-based alloys has  been extensively studied and implemented, producing complex, intri\u00ad cate geometries and small dimensions with high precision, which is  impossible in casting or milling. The properties of Ti-based alloys can be  tailored by percentage, shape, size, and distribution of the \u03b1(HCP) and  \u03b2(BCC) phases at room temperature [542,556,557], as well as by the  interstitial oxygen content. The dual (\u03b1+\u03b2) phase Ti6Al4V alloy is the  most widely used Ti alloy. This is mainly due to its abundant use in  high-impact industries such as aerospace and biomedical. Several pub\u00ad lished papers have reviewed the AM of Ti6Al4V in general, and specif\u00ad ically by DED [205,496,510,558\u2013560].  For AM of Ti6Al4V, it has been reported that a fine acicular  martensitic \u03b1-phase (that is \u03b1\u2019) arranged in a Widmanst\u00a8 atten microstruc\u00ad  ture provides high tensile strength [11] and fatigue strength [561], with  a tradeoff of reduced ductility [11]. Thus, to improve the ductility of the  as-deposited part, a post-processing heat treatment is necessary. Some  comparisons between the mechanical properties of DED-LB, PBF-EB,  cast, and wrought Ti6Al4V alloys have been reported and explained in  terms of their different microstructures. Compared to the wrought alloy,  the shorter fatigue life of the DED-LB-processed alloy has been associ\u00ad ated with microstructure and porosity [213]. DED-LB processing pa\u00ad rameters optimization was suggested to reduce defects and improve  mechanical properties. Furthermore, there is a relationship between the  obtained microstructure characteristics and the fatigue life performance  of the as-deposited part. It was suggested that due to the increased  density of grain boundaries, fine microstructures lead to an increase of  the fatigue life at lower strain amplitudes, while at higher strain am\u00ad plitudes, they lower the fatigue life of the as-deposited part [213]. High  laser power was utilized to DED-LB-process Ti6Al4V, resulting in lower  ductility, comparable tensile strength, and fracture toughness, with  similar fatigue crack growth (FCG) threshold values for the  PBF-EB-processed alloy [164,167]. Higher laser power resulted in an  alloy with higher FCG threshold values for the DED-LB process.  DED-LB-processed Ti6Al4V alloy displayed improved low-cycle fatigue  (LCF) performance, reduced high-cycle fatigue (HCF), reduced FCG  threshold values, and superior fracture toughness than mill-annealed  alloy. These differences were ascribed to the unique lamellar micro\u00ad structure obtained in the DED-LB alloy. It was suggested that the \u03b1-phase  morphology controls the FCG threshold value of DED-LB alloy. This was  attributed to the fact that utilizing high laser power resulted in coarser \u03b1  morphology, which in turn resulted in increased FCG thresholds, with  lower intermediate regime FCG rates [164]. Porosity was claimed to be  responsible for the reduced fatigue life of the DED-LB-processed Ti6Al4V  alloy compared to the wrought alloy [215].  Kobryn and Semiatin [562] studied the effect of stress relief and HIP  post-processing on the fatigue properties of DED-LB-deposited Ti6Al4V  alloy. It was shown that the fatigue strength, ductility, fracture tough\u00ad ness, and tensile strength of HIP\u2019ed (at 900 \u25e6C and 100 MPa for 2 h)  Ti6Al4V is favorably comparable to wrought Ti6Al4V alloy. It was also  shown that the LoF porosity significantly affects anisotropy and me\u00ad chanical properties [562]. Yield strength anisotropy was observed in the  stress-relieved (at 700\u2013730 \u25e6C for 2 h in a vacuum environment) sample  and ascribed to the residual porosity in the DED-LB part. Mechanical and  crystallographic anisotropies were also observed in the HIP\u2019ed and  stress-relieved conditions [562]. HIP was shown to be effective in clos\u00ad ing LoF porosity. Prabhu et al [177] showed that DED-LB-deposited  Ti6Al4V in the as-deposited state had a comparable fatigue life to the  wrought alloy, although residual partly melted powder particles present  at the as-deposited part surface would trigger crack initiation, thus  resulting in a significant reduction in the observed fatigue life.

This phenomenon was ascribed to the  finer grain size of DED-LB-processed alloy, which leads to higher fatigue  crack nucleation time, and the basket-weave and columnar prior \u03b2 grains  in its microstructure, which leads to a higher degree of tortuosity and,  accordingly, more roughness-induced closure effects during crack  propagation [214]. The reader is referred to Refs. [205,496,552,  558\u2013560] for a more comprehensive description of the relations be\u00ad tween processing parameters, defects, microstructure, heat treatment,  and mechanical properties of DED Ti6Al4V.   Examples of some other Ti-alloys are presented in Fig. 7. Byun et al [181] studied the effects of Cr and Fe additions to pre-alloyed Ti6Al4V  on the microstructure and mechanical properties. It was shown that  increasing the concentrations of Fe and Cr resulted in grain refinement  of the prior-\u03b2 grains and the martensite grains, with alterations in the  grain morphology from columnar to equiaxed. The increased Fe and Cr  concentrations also enhanced strength, hardness, and reduced the  ductility.

The nucleation of the \u03b1-phase was explained by the  repetitive heating cycles during deposition, which caused a reduced heat  extraction during solidification. Compared to commercially pure (CP)  Ti, the DED-LB near-\u03b2 alloy exhibited reduced corrosion resistance,  which was strongly affected by the addition of alloying elements, the  applied manufacturing processes, variations in the resulting micro\u00ad structure, and the quality of the native oxide layer. The microstructure  of DED-LB Ti6[dot]5Al2Zr1Mo1V was also studied [185]. The macrostruc\u00ad ture of the as-deposited material consisted of large columnar \u03b2 grains  that grew across several layers in the build direction. A basket-weave  microstructure was evident, with rod-liked shaped \u03b1-phase (volume  fraction of 76[dot]0 \u00b1 3[dot]6%) in the \u03b2-phase matrix. The thermal expansion of  the as-deposited material was irreversible and anisotropic. After  annealing at 960 \u25e6C for 1 h, an increase in \u03b1-phase was observed along  with expansion in the x and y transverse directions, whereas a  contraction was observed in the deposition, z-direction.   Fig. 7a shows the microstructure evolution mechanism and charac\u00ad  teristics of the mixed equiaxed and columnar grain morphology of DED-  LB bimodal Ti6[dot]5Al3[dot]5Mo1[dot]5Zr0[dot]3Si alloy [190,204]. The relationship  between the DED-LB processing parameters, microstructure, and fatigue  properties of this \u03b1+\u03b2 alloy was also reported [186]. The deposition  process resulted in a mixed grain morphology of large columnar and  equiaxed grains alternately distributed. Periodic fluctuations in fatigue  crack growth rates were observed because of the heat-affected bands  (HABs), Fig. 7b. The crack growth rate decelerated at the HABs, accel\u00ad erated immediately after it passed the HABs, and decreased again. The  suggested mechanisms for the deceleration and acceleration were based  on the differences in fracture characteristics in the HAB and its adjacent  area and the changes in microstructure between the two adjacent HABs.  Cracks mostly grew in the equiaxed grain zone and near the edge of the  two zones, although some of them propagated across the columnar grain  zone and finally in the equiaxed grain zone.  \u03b2-Ti alloys are known for their attractive biocompatibility and a good  combination of low Young\u2019s modulus and high strength. Such attributes  triggered the design of \u03b2-Ti alloys, which do not contain toxic elements.  Bhardwaj et al [207] utilized DED-LB to deposit Ti15Mo alloy as a  prospective alloy for bone implant applications. The deposition orien\u00ad tation was found to directly affect the corrosion resistance of the alloy.  An increased corrosion resistance (by ca. 75%) was reported for the  vertically deposited alloy compared to the horizontally deposited alloy.  The surfaces of the as-deposited materials were hydrophilic in both  cases, enhancing apatite formation in vitro. Zhang et al [187] intro\u00ad duced a method for microstructural control of DED-LB Ti15Mo alloy  using a \u201csatelliting\u201d technique (Fig. 7c). This powder feedstock prepa\u00ad ration technique resulted in a controlled attachment between two  distinct elemental powders that varied in size and chemical composi\u00ad tion, forming a Ti powder covered with Mo satellites. A comparison  between conventional elemental mixing of Ti and Mo powders and the  powder feedstock prepared by the satellite technique revealed that the  latter resulted in refined equiaxed grain morphology, while the former  yielded a mixture of large equiaxed and columnar microstructure.   2[dot]5. Aluminum alloys   Conventionally processed aluminum and its alloys second only to  steel in industrial use owing to their low density, high specific strength,  high ductility, high toughness at subzero temperatures, high corrosion  resistance, high thermal and electrical conductivities, high reflectivity,  good processability, good recyclability, and cost-effectiveness [542].  They play a significant role in various applications, including plane  airframes, wings, airfoils, forged engine pistons, fuel cells, fuselages,  satellite and automobile parts, construction, cookware, etc [145].  Combining the favorable characteristics of Al alloys with part design  freedom in AM has attracted great interest in AM of Al alloys. Unfor\u00ad tunately, laser-based AM of most Al alloys raises some significant chal\u00ad lenges due to high surface reflectivity and thermal conductivity   combined with the high cooling rate associated with AM, causing pore  formation and hot cracking in Al alloys [35,563,564]. The inherently  high surface reflectivity of Al requires the application of increased laser  power to allow sufficient energy absorbance and to promote complete  melting of the deposited Al powder [565]. This increased laser power  might lead to gas porosity in the as-deposited alloy due to the vapor\u00ad ization of low-boiling-temperature alloying elements [35,228,438].  Svetlizky et al [228,238] have recently addressed the abovementioned  challenge. They utilized DED-LB to deposit a pre-alloyed gas-atomized  Al 5083 powder and characterized the microstructure and mechanical  properties of the as-deposited alloy. The 5xxx series is Al\u2013Mg-based and  is not age-hardenable. It combines medium-to-high strength with good  weldability and good corrosion resistance in a naval environment.  Svetlizky et al reported a reduction of 35% in the Mg concentration due  to elemental vaporization. The as-deposited alloy\u2019s chemical composi\u00ad tion and mechanical properties were compared with wrought Al 5754 in  the annealed (O) condition, with a maximal relative density of 99[dot]26%  (Fig. 8a).  Wang et al [233] studied the influence of alloying AlMg alloy with  Sc and Zr during the DED-LB process and aging post-treatment at 325 \u25e6C  for 4 h on the precipitation mechanism of Al3(Sc, Zr) and the resulting  mechanical properties. The microstructure of the deposited AlMgScZr  alloy was governed by the distinct thermal history and cooling rate  during air and water cooling. Homogenous equiaxed grain and hetero\u00ad geneous grain structures were reported for air and water cooling,  respectively. The water-cooled samples showed a twofold increase in the  yield strength following aging compared to the air-cooled alloy. This  increase was due to severe precipitation of an Al3(Sc, Zr) phase in the  water-cooled alloy. The increase in the precipitated secondary phase  also affected the microhardness. It was shown that the higher micro\u00ad hardness of the water-cooled alloy and the addition of the precipitated  phase increased the effect of the aging heat treatment (Fig. 8b).  Residual stresses are also a challenge when dealing with laser-based  deposition of Al. The high CTE of Al makes it highly susceptible to  shrinkage, crack formation, and possible material deformation during  the inherent repetitive thermal cycles [35]. The poor powder flowability  of Al due to its low density affects the stability of the blown powder mass  flow rate (PMFR) and, consequently, the deposit\u2019s quality [564]. The  high moisture absorption and surface oxidation of Al are additional  properties hindering good laser-based deposition of Al alloys [35,566].  Due to the above-listed challenges, only limited Al alloy compositions  have been deposited using DED, mainly focusing on AlSi and AlSi10Mg  alloys. This is due to their unique properties, such as excellent laser  absorption, high corrosion resistance, good weldability, and good static  and dynamic mechanical properties [564,567]. An additional reason for  their extensive study is their high content of Si. The addition of Si en\u00ad hances the melt pool wettability, lowers the melting temperature, re\u00ad duces the shrinkage and cracking susceptibility during solidification,  and improves the corrosion resistance [564,567]. Javidani et al [242]  studied the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of  as-deposited DED-LB AlSi10Mg. The microstructure morphology was  reported to vary with the vertical deposition distance from the substrate.  It was shown that the microstructure of the as-deposited Al alloy con\u00ad sisted of three distinct morphologies along the build direction (Fig. 8c),  changing from cellular near the substrate to columnar dendritic at the  center, and finally equiaxed near the top edge. This phenomenon was  attributed to the decrease in cooling rate as the build height increased.  Some studies investigated the effect of the dominant processing pa\u00ad  rameters on the microstructure and properties of DED AlSi10Mg alloy  [222\u2013224,243]. Espa\u02dc na et al [239] showed that process parameters in  DED-LB of as-deposited Al12Si could significantly influence the micro\u00ad structure, hardness, and thermal properties. Liu et al [223] utilized the  Taguchi methodology and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to study the  variable processing parameters (laser power, laser scanning speed,  PMFR, and argon shielding gas flow rate) and any synergistic in\u00ad teractions to optimize the density of the as-deposited AlSi10Mg alloy,   D.

An optimal set of processing parameters was adequate for  high-density (above 99% relative density) AlSi10Mg alloy deposition.  Gao et al [222] showed the importance of laser scan speed on pore  formation, microstructure evolution, and microhardness of AlSi10Mg. It  was concluded that, under similar processing parameters, the increase in  the laser scan speed resulted in increased deposit density, microstructure  refinement, and increased microhardness and tensile properties. This  conclusion is consistent with other studies on the DED of AlSi10Mg alloy  [223,225,243].  Outstanding mechanical properties characterize the Al 7xxx series  compared to the AlSi and AlSi10Mg alloys. Unfortunately, AM of the Al  7xxx series is still a challenge [245]. Selective evaporation of low boiling  point elements such as Zn, Cu, and Mg, the principal alloying elements in  these alloys, might induce gas porosity and consequently degrade the  mechanical properties of the as-deposited alloy [228]. Singh et al [220,  226,245] evaluated the potential of DED-LB of Al 7050. It was shown  that after its deposition, a significant reduction in Mg and Zn occurred  and resulted in porosity and LoF in the as-deposited alloy [220,245]. To  address this challenge, Singh et al [245] used a surface modified Al  7050 pre-alloyed powder coated with Ni to allow improved laser energy  absorbance during laser processing and, by that, reduce the applied laser  energy [226]. Although the Ni-modified Al 7050 powder was found  beneficial in reducing porosity, degradation in mechanical properties  was still observed due to segregation of Ni to the inter-dendritic  boundaries and formation of a brittle Al3Ni intermetallic phase.  The microstructure of DED-LB Al4047 has been reported to consist of  both equiaxed and columnar dendrites, resulting from the melt pool\u2019s  rapid solidification [145,226]. Eliaz et al [145] suggested applying high   laser power (higher than 380 W) as a means for avoiding LoF or cracking  in the outer deposited layers, which determine the surface roughness of  the as-deposited part.   2[dot]6. Nickel-based alloys   Nickel-based alloys are conventionally processed as wrought, cast  (polycrystalline, directionally solidified, or single crystal), or powder  metallurgy (P/M) alloys. They combine excellent tensile and creep  strengths at high homologous temperatures, high aqueous corrosion  resistance, high-temperature oxidation resistance, high hardness and  toughness, low CTE, high strength and ductility at cryogenic tempera\u00ad tures, and excellent solution ability of alloying elements, good weld\u00ad ability and formability [568\u2013570]. The abovementioned properties  make Ni-based superalloys suitable for jet engine, steam turbine, space,  petrochemical, energy conversion, and cryogenic applications [568,  570\u2013572]. However, Ni-based alloys have poor machinability. Their  machining might induce residual stresses and various types of defects,  which might promote catastrophic failure during the part\u2019s service life  [569\u2013571]. Addressing these challenges, AM can serve as a potential  alternative to the traditional manufacturing processes of Ni-based al\u00ad loys. In addition, the inherent design flexibility of AM parts may have a  beneficial role in innovative turbine designs with enhanced performance  by incorporating internal cooling micro-channels for improved heat  transfer [292,573,574].  Previous studies have shown the potential of the DED processes to  fabricate and repair Ni-based alloys. Inconel 718 in particular has been  processed by DED and other AM processes [247,248,254,256,258\u2013267,   Fig. 8.

The effect of  applied DED processing parameters on the as-deposited Inconel 718 was  studied by many research groups [258,262,267,299]. Zhong et al [267]  studied the effects of processing parameters, such as laser power, laser  scan speed, and PMFR, on single-track deposition\u2019s geometrical char\u00ad acteristics, porosity, and powder catch efficiency at high deposition  rates (that is higher than 0[dot]3 kg/h). A strong influence of the deposition  path and laser power on the microstructure and texture of as-deposited  Inconel 718 was observed (Fig. 9a) [254]. The variations in dendritic  growth morphology and crystallographic orientation were ascribed to  the influence of the vertical and horizontal heat fluxes along with the  melt pool as the scanning paths and applied laser energy sequence  during deposition were changed. The increase in laser power resulted in  an elongated, aligned columnar grain structure that resulted in epitaxial  grain growth. This phenomenon was explained by the increased laser  power affecting the thermal gradient and the melt pool, which resulted  in nearly vertical heat flux. Based on experimental results, Liu et al [299] reported a nonlinear melt pool temperature profile with an in\u00ad crease in the single wall deposit\u2019s height. Furthermore, the influence of   the applied laser power and scanning speed on the temperature profile in  the melt pool was shown. Johnson et al [264] reported comparable  tensile properties of DED-LB and heat-treated versus wrought Inconel  718 (see Ref. [264] for heat-treatment specifications). However, the  DED-LB alloy had a considerably shorter fatigue life than the wrought  alloy. Fractographic analysis revealed that the fatigue crack was initi\u00ad ated from apparent porosity near the surface and LoF defects. In a later  study [277], the same group investigated the fatigue properties of heat  treated (according to AMS 5596C specifications) Inconel 718 at elevated  temperatures (650 \u25e6C). The HCF life of the DED-LB alloy was found  comparable to that of the wrought alloy. However, the LCF life of the  DED-LB alloy was shorter than that of the wrought alloy. This was  ascribed to cracking of the brittle \u03b4 and Laves phases at high strains  promoted by elevated temperatures (Fig. 9b). Fig. 9d shows the influ\u00ad ence of heat treatments (direct aging, homogenization, solution treat\u00ad ment, or combination of them) on the tensile properties and fracture  toughness of DED-LB Inconel 718. Homogenization plus solution treat\u00ad ment plus aging (HSTA, see Ref. [278] for heat-treatment specifications)  yields the most favorable combination of tensile and fracture toughness  properties compared to either the as-deposited condition or wrought  alloy (see Fig. 9d).

It was shown that a unique thermal history  was involved under these conditions. This thermal history influenced  the microstructure evolution and precipitation of \u03b4, \u03b3\u2032, and \u03b3\" phases  along the build direction. While \u03b3\u2032 and \u03b3\" phases precipitated at the  bottom and middle zones, the short holding time within the temperature  range required for precipitation was not sufficient at the top zone.  Consequently, the tensile strengths and microhardness were inferior at  the top zone compared to the bottom and middle zones, affirming the  necessity of post-processing heat treatment of DED-LB Inconel 718  (Fig. 9c).  The study of DED Ni-based alloys has not been limited to Inconel  718. The effects of processing parameters on the deposit\u2019s quality and  porosity in Inconel 625 were also studied [271]. Variation in micro\u00ad hardness as a function of the layer\u2019s distance from the substrate was  reported. This was mainly ascribed to variations in the melt pool\u2019s  cooling rates and thermal history between deposited layers. It was  suggested that one could achieve even hardness along the deposited  material by controlling the cooling rates during the deposition process.  Zhong et al [296] studied the melt pool characteristics and deposit  properties of as-deposited Inconel 625 and 718 using a high-speed  camera. While Inconel 718 showed reduced microhardness compared  to its wrought alloy\u2019s standard, Inconel 625 showed superior hardness  compared to its standard requirement. Such differences in microhard\u00ad ness between the two alloys and their wrought counterparts were  attributed to the differences in the melt pool\u2019s cooling rates. Higher  cooling rates result in refined grain size and an increase in the density of  grain boundaries, which resist dislocation motion during deformation,  and the apparent microhardness is increased. The reduced microhard\u00ad ness of Inconel 718 was also ascribed to its strengthening mechanism,  which is dominated mainly by precipitation hardening, unlike that of  Inconel 625, which is mainly strengthened by solid solution of Nb and  Mo [273]. Jinoop et al [249] utilized DED-LB to study the deposition  process and properties of defect-free Hastelloy X (NiCrMoCoW) alloy at  high deposition rates (between 8[dot]25 and 13[dot]2 kJ/g). It was shown that,  far from the deposition substrate, fine columnar dendrites grew in the  direction of heat flow and across adjacent deposition layers, thus sug\u00ad gesting epitaxial grain growth. In contrast, such secondary dendrites  were not observed close to the substrate. It was shown that the me\u00ad chanical properties, such as microhardness, tensile strength, yield  strength, and ductility, of as-deposited DED-LB Hastelloy X were com\u00ad parable to those of either its wrought or PBF-LB counterparts.   2[dot]7. Cobalt-based alloys   Co-based alloys exhibit high hardness, exceptional wear resistance,  biocompatibility, and good corrosion resistance [301,302,309,542], but  suffer from poor machinability, casting ability, and forgeability.  Co-based alloys are better than Ni-based alloys in service conditions that  require high resistance against hot corrosion [572] and thermal fatigue  (due to their lower CTE). However, unlike Ni-based alloys, Co-based  alloys are usually not strengthened by coherent precipitates. The final  part requires complex geometries and complex mold preparation. This  makes AM a potentially attractive alternative for manufacturing  Co-based parts requiring substantial design flexibility and minimal  post-processing. Applications of Co-based alloys include jet engines,  petrochemical, oil and gas, load-bearing knee, dental and other im\u00ad plants, magnetic devices, etc [303,308,309].  To date, relatively limited work has been carried out on DED of Co-  based alloys, focusing on CoCrMo [300,301,305\u2013308,310,575] and  CoCrW [302,303,309,311,312] alloys. The properties of CoCrMo alloys  are controlled by the applied heat treatment and the presence, size, and  distribution of carbide precipitates [301,576]. The effect of heat treat\u00ad ment and processing parameters of DED-LB-processed CoCrMo alloy was  studied using the design of experiments (DOE) approach [300,695]. The  group has shown that the aging time has the most predominant effect on   microhardness. DED-LB CoCrMo had uniform microhardness compara\u00ad ble to the wrought alloy in the as-deposited state. However, heat treat\u00ad ment (see Ref. [300] for heat-treatment specifications) showed  non-uniform surface microhardness, although the hardness was higher  than in the non-heat-treated condition. Mallik et al [301,575] reported  the effects of deposition conditions and heat treatment on the corrosion  resistance of DED-LB CoCrMo alloy. Corrosion appeared mainly at grain  boundaries due to carbide precipitation and a local decrease in Cr con\u00ad centration. The effect of heat treatment was also studied [300]. It was  shown that both solution and aging treatments had no significant effect  on the measured grain size. It was reported that by increasing the  duration of the solution heat treatment, one could reduce the concen\u00ad tration of precipitates, as it allowed more time for carbides to dissolve in  the cobalt matrix. In contrast, an increase in the aging duration resulted  in increased carbide precipitation. This phenomenon was ascribed to the  decrease in carbide solubility in the matrix. The wear resistance of  DED-LB-deposited CoCrMo was also studied [308,575]. It was  concluded that the as-deposited samples processed under conditions  that yield finer microstructure exhibited enhanced wear resistance  [575]. Ram et al [308] reported reduced wear resistance of the  as-deposited CoCrMo alloy compared to its wrought counterpart. This  was mainly due to irregular, continuous interconnected carbide  morphology, which provided reduced wear protection than the optimal  case where the precipitated carbides are regularly shaped and uniformly  distributed in the cobalt matrix. The effect of the dominant processing  parameters on the microstructure and wear properties of CoCrW  deposited by DED-LB was studied by Suresh et al [311]. It was shown  that carbide precipitation was mainly along dendritic grain boundaries,  with two distinct morphologies and compositions \u2013 lamellar (Co-rich)  and particulates (Cr-rich). Wear analysis of the as-deposited CoCrW  alloy showed comparable results to its wrought counterpart. The effect  of different heat treatment conditions (see Ref. [302] for heat-treatment  specifications) on the microstructure and microhardness of DED-LB  CoCrW alloy was also studied [302]. The microhardness highly corre\u00ad lated with the change in carbide\u2019s fraction, morphology, and distribu\u00ad tion in the cobalt matrix, which were associated with the specific heat  treatment.   2[dot]8. Intermetallics   Intermetallic compounds, particularly metal aluminides such as iron,  titanium, or nickel aluminides, combine high melting temperature, high  strength at high temperatures, low density, and good oxidation resis\u00ad tance [313,318,577]. Traditionally, intermetallics are processed by  casting, P/M, or hot extrusion. However, these manufacturing processes  are costly and might yield brittle parts with high shrinkage and coarse  microstructures, which do not allow post-processing such as cold  working or subtractive processing, thus limiting their applications [313,  318,323]. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential use of DED to  fabricate high-quality intermetallics, particularly iron aluminides  [313\u2013315,318,319,321,323]. Karczewski et al [313] studied the  microstructure and mechanical properties of annealed (at 400 \u25e6C for 10  h) thin-walled parts made of FeAl with 16 wt% Al and fabricated by  DED-LB. Variations in wall thickness directly affected the apparent melt  pool cooling rates, resulting in distinct crystalline structures in the  as-deposited material. Despite the high cooling rates, the microstructure  was characterized by elongated columnar grains of the order of  magnitude of several hundreds of micrometers along the build direction.  This result was consistent with other studies of DED-LB of Fe\u2013(28 at%)Al  [315]. High brittleness with substantial cracking in the as-deposited  material after EDM cutting was also observed. Rolink et al [315]  showed that preheating the substrate to 200 \u25e6C hinders the cracking  upon rapid cooling. Other studies showed that modifying the binary  Fe\u2013Al compound by alloying elements such as (Cr, Nb, B) [319], Ti  [323], (Zr, B) [314,318], and Cr [321] may result in enhanced tensile  and compression strengths, microhardness, ductility, and corrosion   D.

Nickel aluminides [291,317,320] and titanium aluminides  [316,322] for high-temperature applications were also processed by  DED-LB. Tlotleng [316] studied the effect of heat treatment (at 1400 \u25e6C  for 2 h in argon environment) of binary DED-LB TiAl by utilizing  elemental Ti and Al powder feedstock. It was shown that heat treatment  strongly affected the microstructure in terms of grain size, phase, and  lamellae. A strong dependence of microhardness on the grain size and  type of lamellae at three distinct regions along the build direction was  reported. No apparent influence of heat treatment on the microhardness  was observed when compared to the as-deposited condition. Balla et al [322] demonstrated strong effects of the DED-LB processing parameters,  such as laser scan speed and applied laser power, on defects appearance,  wear and corrosion characteristics of as-deposited TiAlCrNb (\u03b3-TiAl),  and defined acceptable windows for different processing parameters.   2[dot]9. Shape memory alloys (SMAs)   SMAs are metallic materials that undergo solid-to-solid phase  transformations [327,547], which are induced by proper temperature or  stress changes and during which they can recover permanent strains.  Such alloys include, among others, NiTi, NiTiCu, and CuAlNi. SMAs  benefit from a combination of shape memory effect (SME), super\u00ad elasticity, high strength, high fatigue resistance, and good damping  properties [547]. The advantages derived from the unique properties of  SMAs, which ordinary metals do not display, have resulted in many  applications such as medical devices (for example cardiovascular, dental, and  orthopedic devices as well as surgical tools), aerospace, automotive,  construction, robotics, telecommunication, optics, vibration-dampers,  release or deployment mechanisms, etc [326,334,349,547,578\u2013581].  To date, NiTi (Nitinol), at a near Ni/Ti equiatomic ratio, is considered  the most used SMA due to its unique combination of functional prop\u00ad erties, which allow it to recover relatively large strains (up to 8% [582])  by either heat activation or unloading [326].  Although the applicability of SMAs is promising in a broad aspect of  industries, it is still considered in its infancy as several critical aspects  are yet to be addressed [578]. Traditional NiTi manufacturing processes  such as casting and P/M are common practices but are still considered  challenging due to the high reactivity of Ti, its poor machinability, and  the high levels of impurities associated with such process [330,338,583,  584]. DED has therefore been studied as a potential manufacturing  process, which allows the fabrication of near-net-shape NiTi parts from  either a mixture of pure Ni and Ti powders [325,327,329,331,334\u2013336,  338,347,352,353] or pre-alloyed NiTi [324,326\u2013328,333,334,337,338,  348\u2013352,585] with a pre-defined Ti-to-Ni ratio. The functional proper\u00ad ties of NiTi are susceptible to composition, grain size, phase fraction, and  impurities (such as oxygen and carbon) [330]. Among others, such im\u00ad purities may form due to the high reactivity of Ti with oxygen at high  temperatures, which might result in the formation of undesired sec\u00ad ondary phases, and consequently \u2013 variations in the phase trans\u00ad formation temperatures and degradation in functional characteristics,  including mechanical properties [336,337,348,579]. Lee and Shin [334]  studied the chemical composition of as-deposited NiTi on the micro\u00ad structure, transformation temperatures, and mechanical properties. The  desired final chemical composition was controlled by varying the  powder ratios during deposition. It was shown that the as-deposited  alloy contained less than 10% of Ti2Ni secondary phase (that is consider\u00ad ably less than following conventional manufacturing techniques [334]).  All Ni-rich samples showed austenite and martensite phases at room  temperature, while the near-equiatomic material contained only the  martensite phase. The variations in the chemical composition of the  Ni-rich as-deposited NiTi samples had little effect on the mechanical  properties under compression. Pure-element powders were suggested as  better powder feedstock than pre-alloyed powder because it is easier to  control the chemical composition of the as-deposited material and is  more cost-effective [334]. However, the use of elemental powder feed\u00ad stock might result in heterogeneous microstructures that require heat   treatment to achieve microstructural homogenization [327,334].  Wang et al [335] performed a comparative study using an elemental  mixture of Ni and Ti powders in equiatomic ratio and three different AM  techniques: DED, PBF-LB, and PBF-EB. It was concluded that the print\u00ad ability of near-net-shaped NiTi alloy using elemental Ni and Ti powders  via PBF-LB and PBF-EB is not sustainable due to a strong exothermic  reaction between the Ni and Ti constitutes, which results in micro\u00ad structural inhomogeneity, keyhole, and LoF defects. However, DED-LB  successfully deposited dense NiTi samples with a good fusion between  adjacent deposited layers and proper phase transformation (Fig. 10a). A  high amount of unwanted Ti2Ni brittle intermetallic phases was formed  during solidification (Fig. 10a), and Ni evaporation, altering the final  alloy chemical composition, was observed. The formation of unwanted  secondary phases and the slight Ni evaporation during laser-based  deposition of NiTi have been reported elsewhere too [325,347,352,  353,586]; this commonly happens near the substrate or in between  deposition layers [347,353]. Various research groups studied the effect  of the DED processing parameters on the chemical composition,  microstructure, physical, mechanical, and functional properties of  near-net-shape NiTi [324,327,328,330,331,333\u2013338,350\u2013352,585].  Kumar et al [337] reported that the microstructure, phase trans\u00ad formation characteristics, density, and mechanical properties of  as-deposited NiTi depended on the applied energy density. It was shown  that while increasing the laser energy density (by changing the laser  power) reduced the as-deposited NiTi porosity, a small amount of Ti2Ni  precipitates and martensite phase were formed at the highest laser en\u00ad ergy density. The increase in laser energy density resulted in higher  hardness while presenting reduced elastic and pseudoelastic recovery  properties. The increase in laser energy density shifted the trans\u00ad formation temperatures of the as-deposited NiTi to higher values. This  phenomenon was attributed to the elemental evaporation of Ni at high  energy densities, which resulted in a higher concentration of Ti, thus  increasing the transformation temperatures [336,337]. Baran and  Polanski [330] supported the importance of the applied energy density  on the microstructure and transformation temperatures of as-deposited  NiTi. In that study, the applied energy density was varied by changing  the laser scan speed (between 1 and 30 mm/s). The laser scan speed  significantly affected the microstructure of the as-deposited NiTi and the  formation of unwanted secondary phases. The grain structure changed  its morphology from columnar to equiaxed at lower scan rates. How\u00ad ever, no clear trend was observed at lower scan rates in terms of the  effect of laser scan speed and the transformation temperatures. In  contrast, the transformation temperatures were characterized by a  constant value at higher laser scan rates, regardless of the increase in  scan rate (Fig. 10b).  Post-processing heat treatment was reported as an additional means  for controlling the microstructure, phase transformation characteristics,  functional and mechanical properties of DED NiTi [325,326,334\u2013336,  347\u2013349,352,353]. The presence of unwanted secondary phases such as  NiTi2 and Ni3Ti was reported to modify the chemical composition of the  as-deposited NiTi alloy and inhibit the SME [348]. Thus, it is common to  perform a solid-solution heat treatment within the range of 800 to  1050 \u25e6C as a means for achieving increased microstructural homoge\u00ad neity and reducing residual stresses and microstructural defects in the  as-deposited NiTi [336,348,352,579]. Subsequent aging heat treatment  is then done at lower temperatures (300\u2013700 \u25e6C) to enhance the me\u00ad chanical properties by the formation of uniform Ni-rich precipitates  (Ni4Ti3 and Ni3Ti) within the NiTi matrix [347,587]. Hamilton et al [347] studied the effect of different heat treatments of DED-LB Ni-rich  Ni53[dot]0Ti47[dot]0 (at%) on the microstructural and superelastic compression  responses. For this purpose, four thermal conditions of the same NiTi  composition were characterized: (1) as-deposited, (2) solution  heat-treated (950 \u25e6C for 10\u201324 h), (3) directly aged (550 \u25e6C for 3 h), (4)  solution heat treated and aged (950 \u25e6C for 10\u201324 h + 550 \u25e6C for 3 h). It  was shown that in both the as-deposited condition and the 10 h-solution  heat-treated condition, Ni4Ti3 and Ni3Ti secondary phases were   D. Svetlizky et al",

Increasing the solution heat treatment time to 24 h resulted in  the full dissolution of these secondary phases and homogenous micro\u00ad structure (Fig. 10c), leaving the martensitic B19\u2032 and R-phases along  with austenitic B2 phase predominant. These results agree with the  earlier study of the same research group [353]. Chemical composition  anisotropy was observed in the as-deposited NiTi along the build di\u00ad rection. This phenomenon was attributed to elemental segregation upon  material solidification. The chemical composition anisotropy reduced as  the solution heat treatment time increased and upon material homoge\u00ad nization. The group also studied, by a compression test, the superelastic  properties in all studied conditions. It was shown that the directly aged  sample had a complete strain recovery after compressive load unload\u00ad ing, contrary to the other conditions that exhibited different degrees of  residual strains (Fig. 10c). These results are consistent with previous  work [353]. Hamilton et al [327] investigated the SME recovery of  DED-LB NiTi. The stress-strain-temperature response showed hardening  slope when the critical stress was exceeded, with incomplete strain re\u00ad covery upon unloading and subsequent heating (Fig. 10d). This was  ascribed to the fact that the martensitic phase was permanently  deformed beyond the critical stress, not allowing the full strain recovery  of the as-deposited NiTi [327]. However, when the applied load did not  exceed the critical stress, full recovery of the residual strain was  observed (around 3% macroscale strain recovery, see Fig. 10d). The  group also performed cyclic stress-strain-temperature experiments (up  to 15 cycles). It was shown that the critical stress decreased after the  application of five cycles, showing a non-distinguishable transition be\u00ad tween elastic linear to nonlinear response, along with the reduction of  the elastic modulus from 60 to 10 GPa. No substantial variation in the  cyclic response was observed between 10 and 15 cycles, presenting  around 2% macro-scale strain recovery (Fig. 10d).  The utilization of DED to fabricate SMAs is not limited to NiTi. In  recent years, magnetic SMAs such as Heusler NiMnGa [339,341,342]  and CoNiGa [340] have attracted increasing interest due to their  ferromagnetic and high-temperature SME [339,341,588]. Such alloys  were reported to sustain up to 10% reversible plastic strains upon  applying an external magnetic field [588,589], and show promising  properties useful in actuators, energy harvesting devices, sensors in  biomedical and aerospace applications [341,342,590,591]. However,  these alloys are brittle and have poor machinability, making them hard  to form and shape [341,589].  Lauhoff et al [68] successfully utilized DED-LB to deposit crack-free  Co49Ni21Ga30 high-temperature SMA. The microstructure of the  as-deposited material was characterized by epitaxial growth of  columnar grains across adjacent deposition layers along the build di\u00ad rection. The columnar grain growth resulted in a strong microstructural  anisotropy. Such microstructural anisotropy enhanced the shape mem\u00ad ory and superelastic properties by minimizing grain constraints [340,  592]. A superelastic compressive strain recovery of up to 5[dot]5% was  measured for the as-deposited material, with high cyclic reversibility  [340].   2[dot]10. High-entropy alloys (HEAs)   HEAs represent a relatively novel alloy design concept introduced in  the last decade [593]. Such a design concept involves several alloying  elements, usually five or more, in equimolar or near-equimolar ratios  [593,594]. It results in a significantly expanded range of alloy design  combinations compared to the conventional alloy design concept based  on a mixture of one or two main alloying elements with minor additions  of specific elements to enhance certain properties [595]. As a result of  the multi-compositional alloy design, HEAs offer a distinct combination  of properties such as high strength, hardness and fracture toughness,  superior wear resistance, good corrosion resistance, and high thermal  resistance [593\u2013596].  The combination of the inherent advantages of DED with the supe\u00ad  rior properties of HEAs has attracted increased interest from various   industries. To date, only limited DED HEA studies have been reported, e.  g, ZrTiVCrFeNi [355], TiZrNbMoV [355,374,597], CrMnFeCoNi [356,  358,369,598], LaNiFeVMn [373], AlCoCrCuFeSi0[dot]5 [370], CoCrBFeNiSi  [599,600], NiCrCoTiV [601], AlCoCrFeNiTi0[dot]5 [602], and FeCoCrNiAlBx  [603]. Among the studied HEAs, the equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi alloy has  attracted special interest due to its remarkable properties, such as  exceptional ductility and high fracture toughness, especially in cryo\u00ad genic environments [359\u2013361,364,365,596,604]. Guan et al [354]  studied the microstructure and tensile properties of DED-LB CrMnFe\u00ad CoNi. The microstructure of the as-deposited HEA was characterized by  columnar epitaxial grain growth consisting of fine grains of  solid-solution FCC phase with an average size of 13 \u03bcm along the  maximal heat flux direction Fig. 11a. The residual stresses in DED-LB  CrMnFeCoNi were measured as ~182 MPa. These high residual  stresses were associated with the high dislocation density in the  as-deposited HEA. Fig. 11b [360] shows heterogeneous strain distribu\u00ad tion with increased tensile strains, where strain concentrations appear  mainly at the slip band regions and between slip bands with different  grain orientations. It was shown that both transgranular and inter\u00ad granular cracks are formed at the maximal strain concentration regions.  In a recent study [361], laser shock peening post-treatment was  utilized to enhance the tensile properties of DED-LB CrMnFeCoNi alloy.  The surface roughness increased because of the increase in shock  peening cycles. Interestingly, the shock peening treatment generated  sufficient plastic deformation on the surface of the deposited material to  effectively enclose pores close to the surface, Fig. 11d. (AlxCoCrFe)50Ni  HEAs with varied Al concentrations (0\u201316[dot]7 at%) were DED-LB to study  the effect of Al concentration on the microstructure and microhardness  of the as-processed alloy [363]. An increase in Al concentration resulted  in microstructure transformation from FCC single-phase cellular den\u00ad dritic to lamellar eutectic with L12 nanoprecipitation within a matrix  consisting of a mixture of FCC and BCC stable phases (Fig. 11e). The  observed nano-precipitation strengthening effect due to the increase in  Al concentration substantially increased the microhardness of the  as-deposited (AlxCoCrFe)50Ni HEA, from 132 to 342 VHN.  One of the most comprehensively studied DED HEAs is AlxCoCrFeNi  [357,366,368,371,372,605] due to its unique combination of properties  and to the low cost of its elemental constituents [357]. Kunce et al [366]  reported an increase of approximately 13% in the microhardness of  DED-LB AlCoCrFeNi alloy compared to its as-cast counterpart due to  increased melt pool cooling rate and the increased temperature,  resulting in refined grain size. Wang et al [357] employed atom probe  tomography (APT) and observed severe segregation of Ni, Al, and Cr,  while Fe and Co were homogeneously dispersed in DED-LB AlCoCrFeNi  (Fig. 11c). In addition, reduced corrosion and pitting potential were  measured for DED-LB AlCoCrFeNi alloy compared to 304L SS. Chao  et al [605] studied the microstructure of AlxCoCrFeNi (x = 0[dot]3, 0[dot]6, or  0[dot]85). It was shown that an increase in the Al concentration in the  as-deposited HEA resulted in tailored crystal structure transformation  from FCC solid solution to a duplex FCC + BCC and BCC solid solutions.  Joseph et al [371] studied the deformation mechanisms of three distinct  crystal structures of AlxCoCrFeNi (x = 0[dot]3, 0[dot]6, or 0[dot]85). The alloy with x  = 0[dot]85 aluminum showed superior yield strength but limited plastic  deformation in tension compared to the other two alloys with lower Al  concentrations. In contrast, the latter two alloys exhibited relatively low  tensile strength and higher ductility [371]. A comparative study be\u00ad tween DED-LB and DED-arc AlxCoCrFeNi (x = 0[dot]3, 0[dot]6, or 0[dot]85) HEAs  yielded similar mechanical properties for both fabrication methods  [372].   2[dot]11.

Consequently, they are in high demand in various applica\u00ad tions, such as construction, petrochemical, aerospace, and medical de\u00ad vices [542,543]. However, they suffer from poor ductility, low impact  resistance, low fracture toughness, limited tensile strength, lack of strain  hardening, statistically wide distribution of mechanical properties, and  limited manufacturability (poor castability, machinability, plastic  formability, non-weldability, and hard to join by fasteners). Conse\u00ad quently, direct fabrication of complex ceramic parts and their processing  are highly challenging and often costly [377,379,606,607].  The introduction of AM techniques suitable for processing and  manufacturing ceramic parts opened an avenue for fabricating ceramic  parts that have been challenging or even impossible using traditional  manufacturing processes [379]. Nevertheless, most such AM techniques   are indirect AM processes that use binder materials or plasticizers to  form a green part, followed by a sintering process for binder removal  and final part densification [608]. Due to residual binder material, these  commonly result in high-porosity parts, high crack density, and large  organic or inorganic impurities [379]. In contrast, direct AM techniques,  such as DED and SLM, show promising results for high purity and  functional properties [380,398,406,407,411]. To date, only a limited  number of DED ceramics have been reported (see references in Table 1).  Balla et al [398] demonstrated the first-ever direct fabrication of  alumina using DED-LB. The as-deposited structures showed strong  anisotropy in mechanical properties in directions parallel and perpen\u00ad dicular to the build direction. However, heat treatment at 1000 and  1600 \u25e6C for 5 h in air reduced this anisotropy due to sintering effects.   Fig. 11.

Balla et al [398] also reported that the high  cooling rates associated with the DED-LB process resulted in  as-deposited Al2O3 comprised of thermodynamically stable \u03b1-Al2O3  phase, without any presence of metastable alumina phases such as  \u03b3-Al2O3. Later, Li et al [379] studied the effect of the DED-LB processing  parameters such as input laser power, laser scan speed, and PMFR on  alumina quality. It was concluded that the increase in the input laser  power had a positive effect on the geometrical properties of the deposit,  powder catchment efficiency, surface roughness, flatness, and micro\u00ad hardness. The increase in laser scan speed, however, resulted in opposite  effects.  In general, ceramic materials are highly prone to cracking due to  their lack of ductility. Therefore, the inherent characteristics of laser-  based deposition processes, such as the high cooling rates, high ther\u00ad mal gradient, and high thermal stress, make the deposition of ceramic  materials highly challenging. Niu et al [411] performed a process  optimization study on DED-LB Al2O3 for effective crack suppression. It  was shown that the temperature gradient between two adjacent layers  had the most detrimental effect on the crack formation following DED. It  was also shown that by increasing the laser scan speed, the resultant  thermal stress decreased while the fracture strength increased, conse\u00ad quently resulting in a crack-free deposition. Preheating the substrate  was an additional means for effective crack suppression in DED of  ceramic-based materials [609]. The preheating process reduced the  thermal gradient, resulting in reduced residual stresses and, conse\u00ad quently, reduced cracking in the as-deposited material [248].  Niu et al [407] utilized DED-LB and studied the effect of  second-phase doping of Y2O3 in high-purity Al2O3 to form an  Al2O3/YAG eutectic ceramic. It was shown that the applied laser power  strongly affected the geometrical characteristics, such as thickness and  height, of the as-deposited ceramic thin wall. Furthermore, it was shown  that the as-deposited eutectic ceramic had 98[dot]6% relative density and  exhibited comparable microhardness and fracture toughness to those of  the counterpart material processed by traditional techniques.  Al2O3\u2013ZrO2 eutectic ceramic is an additional ceramic material that has  attracted increased interest in recent years [377,381,387,393,395,406,  408\u2013410], primarily due to its superior thermomechanical properties,  which are vital for ultrahigh temperature applications [409]. Yan et al [393] studied the influence of processing parameters (laser power, laser  scan speed, and PMFR) on the density of Al2O3\u2013ZrO2. Optimal process  parameters yielded a ceramic with minimal porosity of 0[dot]22%. The ef\u00ad fect of doping DED-LB Al2O3 with ZrO2 [392,394,406] and Y2O3 [406]  was studied. Compared to the as-deposited Al2O3 sample, which con\u00ad tained numerous vertical cracks due to the thermal stresses developed  during deposition, the Al2O3\u2013ZrO2 and Al2O3\u2013Y2O3 samples exhibited  less cracking [392,394,406], for example with the increase in ZrO2 concentra\u00ad tion [392,394]. It was indicated that the introduction of the second  phase resulted in a refined eutectic microstructure with no clear grain  growth orientation and with a minimal adverse effect on the micro\u00ad hardness [406]. A unique integration between the LENS\u2122 deposition  technique and ultrasonic vibration was applied to deposit Al2O3\u2013ZrO2  ceramics  [377,381,393,409,410].  It  was  reported  that  the  ultrasonic-assisted LENS\u2122 process resulted in a refined microstructure  (Fig. 12c), including a reduction in eutectic spacing (~50 nm [393]) and  no clear grain boundaries (Fig. 12a). Increased fracture toughness [377,  381] and microhardness [381] were also observed (Fig. 12d).  In recent studies, Pappas et al [397,399\u2013401] studied DED-LB  transparent MgAl2O4 spinel ceramics (Fig. 12b). The effects of feed\u00ad stock powder diameter and applied processing parameters, such as laser  power, laser scan speed, and PMFR, on the porosity [399,400], crack  length [399], optical properties [397,400,401], and mechanical prop\u00ad erties [399], were studied. It was shown that the transmittance of the  DED-LB MgAl2O4 is mainly influenced by crack density and porosity.  The spinel ceramic exhibited a transmittance of up to 82% (at a wave\u00ad length of 632[dot]8 nm), planar porosity of 0[dot]2%, hardness (~1400 VHN),   and fracture toughness comparable MgAl2O4 spinel ceramics produced  via conventional sintering processes.   2[dot]12. Composites   The unique ability of DED to utilize a controlled multi-feed powder  hopper gives rise to the design and fabrication of novel multi-material  systems and engineering components with enhanced properties. Such  an attribute allows one to deposit particle-reinforced metal matrix  composites (MMCs) with a controlled distribution within the deposited  matrix by adjusting the PMFR of the powders introduced to the melt  pool [610]. Alternatively, a predetermined mixture of powders can be  deposited using a single hopper. This capability results in an increased  degree of freedom in designing and fabricating multi-material systems  compared to the PBF AM technique, where the powder feedstock or  mixture of powders is predetermined and statically placed in a desig\u00ad nated vessel. Therefore, over the last years, extensive research has been  done to design, fabricate, and characterize DED composite materials  with enhanced properties. Such composite materials are designed to  have increased strength and stiffness, enhanced wear resistance, and  improved thermal properties such as CTE [416,556]. However, the  physical, optical, and thermal properties mismatch between the matrix  and the reinforcing particulates results in complex interactions and  behavior upon the melting and solidification cycles associated with the  laser-based DED technique. These play a significant role in achieving  high-performance composite materials with high relative densities and  good interfacial bonding. Moreover, most reinforcing powders are  ceramic-based and are characterized by low density. This results in  difficulties in controlling the PMFR during the deposition process. Thus,  it is challenging to design a reproducible and optimized deposition  process.  Various DED composite systems have been studied, mainly focused  on Ti-based MMCs [414\u2013419,426,427,429,434]. Due to the low solu\u00ad bility of boron and carbon in the \u03b1 and \u03b2 phases of Ti-based alloys, TiC  and TiB are considered suitable particulates for reinforcing the Ti matrix  [611]. The introduction of TiB and TiC as reinforcement in Ti-based  MMCs results in increased mechanical properties, such as hardness,  strength, and wear resistance, and increased thermodynamic stability of  the reinforcement particulates in the Ti matrix [556]. Wang et al [419]  studied the effect of the volume fraction of TiC particulates in Ti6Al4V  alloy on the microstructure and tensile properties. The effect of subse\u00ad quent heat treatment (see Ref. [419] for heat-treatment specifications)  on the DED-LB MMC was also demonstrated (Fig. 13a). The micro\u00ad structure of the MMC consisted of a combination of \u03b1-Ti and \u03b2-Ti phases  with primary and eutectic phases of resolidified TiC along with unmel\u00ad ted TiC particles (Fig. 13a). A similar microstructure was also reported  by others [416\u2013418,445]. TiC at 5% volume fraction exhibited optimal  tensile properties compared to Ti6Al4V base alloy (Fig. 13a). In a related  study, Liu et al [418] studied the melting of the TiC particulates in  Ti6Al4V by varying the applied laser energy density at different TiC  volume fractions (0\u201315%). Applying lower energy densities, the least  melting of TiC was observed, with a reduced formation of detrimental  primary dendritic TiC grains. At low energy densities, the macrostruc\u00ad ture of the deposited MMC was characterized by high relative density,  defect-free structure, and uniform distribution of the unmelted TiC. It  was concluded that the unmelted TiC and solid-solution strengthening  by carbon were the primary strengthening mechanisms of the MMC  system.  The failure mechanisms, mechanical and physical properties of the  deposited MMC are governed by the strength of the interfacial bonding  between the particulates and the matrix. To address this issue, several  studies [412,416] have successfully deposited Ni-coated TiC reinforce\u00ad ment particulates, which resulted in an enhanced interfacial bonding  and considerably increased MMC strength. However, the formation of  TiNi intermetallic compounds resulted in a decrease in ductility.  Ti-based MMCs reinforced with TiB are also of high interest and have   D. Svetlizky et al",

Hu et al [426,427,429] studied the effect of  the laser-based deposition process of CP-Ti/TiB powders on the micro\u00ad structure evolution and mechanical properties. The composite powders  were prepared via ball milling, which yielded boron (1[dot]6 wt%) covering  the surface of the CP-Ti powder (98[dot]4 wt%). The microstructure of the  as-deposited MMC revealed a unique ultrafine 3D quasi-continuous  network of TiB aggregates at the Ti grain boundaries (Fig. 13b). The  formation of nano-sized eutectic TiB microstructure depended on the  applied laser power and provided better mechanical properties, such as  hardness and tensile properties, compared to the as-deposited CP-Ti.  Apart from TiC and TiB, SiC has also been used as a reinforcement in  titanium matrix via DED-LB, both as bulk structures and as coatings, to  improve the mechanical properties and wear resistance [612,613].  Several recent studies have focused on the DED of particulate-  reinforced steel-based MMCs. Wang et al [466] studied the effect of  additions of various concentrations of Cr3C2 reinforcing particulates in  316L SS matrix produced via DED-LB on the microstructure evolution  and mechanical properties such as microhardness and wear resistance.  The monolithic DED-LB 316L steel was characterized by columnar grain  growth along the build direction, with dendritic and interdendritic   structures, a low amount of equiaxed grains, and no apparent defects. As  the concentration of Cr3C2 increased (to 5% and 15%), the dissolution of  Cr3C2 promoted fine equiaxed and dendritic grains. When the concen\u00ad tration of Cr3C2 was further increased to 25%, a non-uniform fine  interdendritic microstructure was formed, with non-uniform distribu\u00ad tion of hexagonal precipitated carbides (Fig. 13b). The increase in the  concentration of Cr3C2 was beneficial for the microhardness and wear  resistance properties, governed by solid-solution strengthening and  grain refinement strengthening mechanisms. A DED-LB TiC-reinforced  CrMnFeCoNi HEA was demonstrated recently [473]. The powder feed\u00ad stock was either 2[dot]5 or 5 wt% TiC nano-size powder uniformly coated  over the pre-alloyed CrMnFeCoNi powder. Epitaxial grain growth of the  columnar grains parallel to the build direction was observed. Tensile  measurements of the as-deposited composite revealed that the increase  in TiC concentration resulted in increased yield strength and tensile  strength while being harmful to the ductility of the as-deposited MMC.  Fractography confirmed that the surface fracture morphology changed  from a ductile fracture, characterized by deep dimples and uniform  plastic deformation, in the monolithic CrMnFeCoNi to shallow dimples  (at 2[dot]5 wt% TiC) and no dimples (at 5 wt% TiC).

      "text": "Materials Science & Engineering A 840 (2022) 142967  21  As mentioned in section 2[dot]5, Al-based alloys have unique properties,  making them an attractive material for AM. However, for some appli\u00ad cations, additional enhancement of mechanical properties is required. In  the case of heat-treatable alloys, applying heat treatment to enhance the  mechanical properties may be sufficient for a specific application or  even can be applied as an additional strengthening mechanism in  particulate-reinforced MMC. Alternatively, the fabrication of Al-based  MMCs can serve as an effective method for improving properties, and  at times, be more cost-effective than applying heat treatments [614].  The satelliting method effectively achieved uniform distribution of  reinforcing ceramic particulates in the Al-based matrix [431,438] via  DED-LB. Zhao et al [438] investigated the DED-LB of Al 5024  (AlMgScZr alloy) with varying concentrations of TiC (0, 1, 3, and 5 wt  %). The effect of heat treatment (aged at 300 \u25e6C for 3, 5, and 7 h) on the  mechanical properties was also studied. It was found that when  compared to the as-deposited Al 5024, the addition of TiC at all studied  concentrations yielded reduced or comparable microhardness, tensile  strength, and yield strength. The primary strengthening mechanism was  precipitation strengthening (by nanometer-sized secondary Al3Sc par\u00ad ticles) rather than TiC particulate strengthening. However, in another  study on DED-LB of Al-based MMC, Tan et al [431] reported beneficial  attributes of additions of TiB2 reinforcement particulates in AlSi10Mg  alloy. Among others, the addition of micro/nano TiB2 particulates to the  Al-based matrix resulted in increased strength and microhardness.  DED MMC-based protective coatings also attract increased interest  due to desired properties such as exceptional hardness, wear, and  corrosion resistance. Recent studies utilized DED-LB for the processing  of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) [421,449,451,615]. Huang et al [449] successfully deposited dense (up to 99[dot]95%) alumina/aluminum  titanate (Al2O3/AlxTiyOz) CMC by pre-mixing of Al2O3 and TiO2 pow\u00ad ders to enhance the hardness, flexural strength, and fracture toughness  (up to 1640 VHN, 212 MPa, and 3[dot]75 MPam1/2, respectively) of the  alumina matrix (Fig. 13d). Over recent years, various combinations of  DED-LB MMC protective coatings were studied to enhance surface me\u00ad chanical properties (for example wear resistance and hardness [304,430,458,  460]) and corrosion resistance [448]. Avila et al [448] utilized DED-LB  to fabricate Ti6Al4V\u2013Si-hydroxyapatite coating for articulating surfaces  in load-bearing applications (Fig. 13c). To isolate the influence of Si  addition on the properties of the Ti-based composite, control samples of  monolithic Ti6Al4V and Ti6Al4V MMC reinforced with either 5 wt% or  10 wt% Si were also fabricated, in addition to the Ti6Al4V\u2013(3 wt%)Si\u2013  (2 wt%) hydroxyapatite (HAp) sample. The addition of Si particles as  reinforcing material resulted in the formation of titanium silicides  (Ti5Si3 and TiSi2) and vanadium silicides (V5Si3), thus promoting an  increase of 114% in hardness (for the 10 wt% Si sample) and a reduction  of 38[dot]8% in the coefficient of friction for the Ti6Al4V\u2013Si\u2013HAp com\u00ad posite. Furthermore, it was shown that the formation of Ti5Si3, V5Si3,  and TiSi2 also reduced the wear rate by ~70% in the case of the 10 wt%  Si material. Gualtieri et al [430] successfully utilized DED-LB as a  cladding technique to increase the surface hardness and wear resistance  of 304L SS by adding either 5 wt% or 10 wt% of NbC reinforcing par\u00ad ticulates in the steel matrix. The effect of a post-deposition laser scan  with no powder feeding was also studied. It was shown that the laser  scan post-treatment had beneficial attributes on the coating\u2019s density,  hardness, and wear resistance. DED-LB CoCrAlSiY/YSZ composite  coatings were reported recently [421]. A correlation between the  applied laser energy and properties such as surface roughness, relative  density, microhardness, and wear resistance of the as-deposited MMC  material was established.  Finally, two case studies of processing MMCs by LENS\u2122 are high\u00ad  lighted. A dual continuous immersed phase (DCIP) is defined as an MMC  with two immersed bulk phases continuous in at least one direction.  When the ratio of constituent materials approaches 50:50, neither phase  is truly the matrix or reinforcement phase. Since DED can eliminate the  need for joining, it is ideal for fabricating parts with a DCIP morphology.  Policelli [467] fabricated defect-free bulk MMC samples made of   Ti6Al4V (\u03b1+\u03b2 alloy) and Ti10V2Fe3Al DCIPs. The DCIP morphology  attenuated epitaxial grain growth compared to bulk laser-deposited  Ti6Al4V samples. Samuel et al [461,468,469] processed by DED-LB  an MMC composed of Ti35Nb7Zr5Ta matrix and 2% TiB reinforce\u00ad ment, consisting of an elemental mixture of Ti, Nb, Zr, Ta, and titanium  diboride (TiB2) powders. The goal was to improve wear resistance for  applications such as femoral heads in hip implants. The microstructure  of the MMC consisted of both eutectic boride precipitates and primary  TiB precipitates dispersed in a matrix of \u03b2-Ti. A significant enhancement  of the wear resistance of the boride-reinforced TiNbZrTa alloys was  found compared to Ti6Al4V extra-low interstitials (ELI) alloy.  Defect-free interfaces were documented between the matrix and the  precipitates.   2[dot]13. Functionally graded materials (FGMs) and multilayered materials   The concept of FGMs was first demonstrated in 1987 by a Japanese  research group, which proposed a metal/ceramic thermal barrier for  extreme environments and aerospace applications [616]. By definition,  FGMs are composite materials that present continuous or discrete  transitions in composition or microstructure, resulting in a directional or  multi-directional functional variation in material properties [32,610,  617]. In addition to the FGMs\u2019 main characteristic of tailored properties,  FGMs are beneficial in reducing residual stresses [32] and sharp in\u00ad terfaces where delamination and failure usually occurs [618]. Numerous  processes were developed for the fabrication of bulk FGMs [32,619].  However, DED provides unprecedented design freedom, a combination  of material properties, and a substantial reduction in production time  compared to traditional FGM and multi-materials fabrication techniques  [620]. DED provides all the advantages of layer-by-layer AM while also  utilizing a multi-feed powder system. These allow the design and  fabrication of complex part geometries and control of precise chemical  composition with pre-defined functional, tailored properties at specific  locations within the deposited part. Thus, DED FGMs may play a sig\u00ad nificant role in various high-impact engineering applications, such as  aerospace, biomedical, marine, and automobile [619,621].  The continuous technological developments of DED give rise to an  increasing interest in the design and research of novel FGM and multi\u00ad layered material systems [480]. While various material systems were  reported to be deposited via DED, Ti-based FGMs have attracted the  most interest due to their unique combination of properties and their  wide engineering applications (see section 2[dot]4). Over the years,  numerous Ti-based FGMs and multilayered materials with different   Table 2  Selected systems of Ti-based FGMs and multilayered materials.

Such materials are characterized by  high specific strength, good ductility, high hardness, superior wear  resistance, biocompatibility, and low density [436].

      "text": "Materials Science & Engineering A 840 (2022) 142967  23  when embedded in a Ti-based matrix [32,418]. To date, multiple studies  utilized DED to deposit functionally graded Ti6Al4V/TiC [418,436,437,  445,485,499\u2013501]. Li et al [436] successfully deposited a functionally  graded Ti6Al4V/TiC composite with different volume fractions (0\u201350  vol%) of TiC along the build direction (Fig. 14a). It was shown that the  TiC particulates were homogeneously distributed in the Ti6Al4V matrix,  which exhibited good bonding across deposited layers, with no observed  cracks in the as-deposited FGM. In terms of the mechanical properties of  the as-deposited FGM, the results revealed opposite trends between  microhardness versus tensile strength and elongation with the gradual  increase in TiC volume fraction in the Ti-based matrix (Fig. 14a). These  results are consistent with related studies [418,437,500]. Interestingly,  the measured porosity in the as-deposited FGM increased with the vol\u00ad ume fraction of the TiC particulates. This phenomenon was attributed to  the inherent rapid solidification associated with DED-LB and the  inherent porosity in the TiC powder feedstock.  Ti6Al4V/metal-based alloys also show increasing interest among the  FGM systems. Facilitating good metallurgical and mechanical bonding  between dissimilar materials is considered a great challenge. Charac\u00ad teristics such as lack of interlayer metallurgical compatibility, the for\u00ad mation of brittle intermetallic phases, hot cracking, residual stresses,  and dissimilar CTEs might lead to poor material properties or even  material failure [32,474,475]. Due to the above-listed limitations, and  mainly the formation of intermetallic phases such as TiCr, TiFe, and  TiFe2, the direct joining of Ti6Al4V and stainless steel is considered  highly challenging [475]. Sahasrabudhe et al [498] were the first to  introduce a way to prevent the formation of unwanted intermetallic  phases by introducing a diffusion barrier layer between the materials to  be joined via DED-LB. NiCr was also an effective intermediate transition  layer for joining Ti6Al4V to 410 SS [498]. The results indicated that  incorporating NiCr as a transition layer prevented the formation of  brittle intermetallic phases and reduced cracking and delamination,  which arise due to residual stresses. The selection of such transition  material can be based on its ability to form stable solid-solution phases  with the joint materials or just act as a diffusion barrier. In the case of  joining Ti and Fe, various transition layers were suggested as adequate  candidates, including V, Mo, Zr, Nb, and Ta, to allow the formation of  stable solid solutions with Ti and, thus, reduce the formation of un\u00ad wanted intermetallic phases, consequently enhancing the mechanical  properties of the joint materials [474,623]. In related work, Reichardt  et al [474] studied the microstructural and microhardness character\u00ad istics of functionally graded Ti6Al4V to 304LSS, changing the concen\u00ad tration of V as a transition material along the build direction. It was  found that a gradual transition of V along the build direction did not  prevent the formation of brittle intermetallic phases such as FeTi, which  contributed to cracking during deposition. It was concluded that a few  transition layers of 100% V were needed to allow the segregation of  304L SS and Ti6Al4V. A similar formation of brittle intermetallic phases  was observed by Bobbio et al [496]. Significant cracking was observed  due to the brittle intermetallic \u03c3-FeV phase in DED-LB Ti6Al4V to 304L  with gradual transition vanadium interlayer. In another related work,  Bobbio et al [541] studied the DED of FGM with a gradual transition  from Ti6Al4V to Invar. Formation of detrimental intermetallic phases,  such as FeTi, Fe2Ti, Ni3Ti, and NiTi2, due to the interaction between  Ti6Al4V and Invar alloy during laser processing, was reported. To  address this issue, Li et al [475] studied the DED-LB of Ti6Al4V with  316SS by deposition of three transition layers to avoid the formation of  brittle intermetallic phases (Ti6Al4V\u2192V\u2192Cr\u2192Fe\u2192316 SS). The chem\u00ad ical gradient composition (EDS data) of the as-deposited FGM with  microhardness values along the FGM build direction are shown in  Fig. 14b. It was shown that by applying such a sequence of transition  layers, the formation of intermetallic phases and cracking could be  prevented. Onuike et al [528] showed the best Ti6Al4V to 410 SS  gradient using Nb as a transition layer. The DED-LB structures were also  machined and welded to show the stability of such transition layers. In  another study [506], Inconel 625 alloy was used as a transition layer in   316L to Ti6Al4V FGM. Precipitates of Mo-enriched eutectic phase were  identified as the major cause of cracking. Laser synchronous preheating  made the precipitated phases of the prepared gradient materials fine and  uniformly distributed, thus preventing the formation of cracks. A similar  beneficial effect of synchronous laser preheating on crack elimination  during DED of 316L/Inconel 625 and Inconel 625/Ti6Al4V was also  reported elsewhere [504,522]. In a related study [514], the tensile  properties and microhardness (up to yield strength of 822 MPa and 346  VHN, respectively, at the region of equal content of 50% between 316L  and Inconel 625) of a DED-LB single-wall 316L/Inconel 625 FGM was  reported (Fig. 14c). The wear properties along the single-wall graded  material were also reported, showing an increase in the wear resistance  with the increase in the Inconel 625 relative content (Fig. 14c). Previous  studies [476,491,497,507,520] have also demonstrated the feasibility of  DED to deposit FGM with tailored composition, from Ti or Ti6Al4V to  Mo, for biomedical applications. The gradual transition in chemical  composition from Ti and Ti6Al4V allowed adjusting the Young\u2019s  modulus of the implant material (106\u2013108 GPa for Ti6Al4V) to that of  bone (10\u201330 GPa) as a measure of prevention of stress shielding and  osteoporosis associated with modulus mismatch [491]. In related work,  Lima et al [486] successfully deposited compositionally graded  Ti35Nb15Zr\u2192Ti25Nb8Zr\u2192CP-Ti\u2192Ti25Nb8Zr\u2192Ti35Nb15Zr for appli\u00ad cation as fracture fixation plate. The mechanical properties revealed that  the Young\u2019s modulus was consistent with composition. However,  microhardness revealed substantial variation between the Ti35Nb15Zr  alloy deposited on the substrate and the top Ti25Nb8Zr region. This  change in microhardness was attributed to variations in thermal history  between the two regions, resulting in microstructural differences, and  thus microhardness.  The development of new combinations of FGMs is not limited to  tailoring mechanical properties such as microhardness, tensile proper\u00ad ties, and wear properties for structural applications. The ability to tailor  other functional properties, such as thermal, electrical, or magnetic, to  predefined locations is also of great interest. In a related study [529],  DED-LB was successfully utilized to directly fabricate 316 austenitic SS  (nonmagnetic) to 430 ferritic SS (magnetic) FGM (Fig. 14d), with  tailored magnetic functionality.   3. The construction of DED processing databases and Ashby  diagrams   Well-established databases are becoming essential for the develop\u00ad  ment and standardization in AM, including DED. Such databases may  allow users to identify optimal processing parameters to achieve a spe\u00ad cific set of properties (for example physical properties, mechanical properties,  thermal properties, electrical properties, etc) to meet the desired  application requirements. Based on these databases, Ashby diagrams  can be constructed and help optimize existing DED materials and  develop new AM materials. To date, the utilization of Ashby diagrams in  DED has been minor (see, for example, Refs. [33,280]). Fig. 15 shows an  example of an Ashby diagram that presents the dependence of the  relative density of some DED alloy steels on the comparison parameter, S  (S=P/\u03bdG, where P is the laser power [J/s], G is the PMFR [g/min], and \u03bd  is the laser scan speed [mm/s]) [12]. Both axes are drawn on a linear  scale, not a logarithmic one, given the small number of steels included in  this diagram and the wish to clarify the value ranges for potential users.  All data points were retrieved from references listed in Table 1. The  selection of density as the material property to be presented in this di\u00ad agram was made after retrieving all reported data (processing parame\u00ad ters and material characterization) from all references in Table 1,  choosing the property with enough reports to construct such a plot.  While there are many publications on each material family, there are  many data gaps (for example not all processing parameters were reported).  Furthermore, not all references characterize the same properties, mak\u00ad ing it challenging to construct a comprehensive Ashby diagram.   D. Svetlizky et al",

Freeform DED-LB   DED-LB is typically used in industry to fabricate net and near-net-  shape freeform structures, clad materials for wear and corrosion resis\u00ad tance, repair, or add features on conventionally processed parts [705].  The paper so far has mainly focused on the freeforming of materials. This  section will briefly describe large freeform structures, whereas sections 5  and 6 will describe cladding and repair applications, respectively.  Svetlizky et al [12] have recently reviewed applications of DED,  along with its physical characteristics, challenges and associated defects  in the deposited material. Fig. 2f shows a large aerospace component  fabricated by Relativity Space by a WAAM process. Fig. 2e [12] shows a  large-scale rocket nozzle manufactured for aerospace applications  [706]. The manufacturing of liquid rocket engine (channel wall) nozzles  by DED has also been demonstrated by NASA [707]. Fig. 13c [12] shows  a door handle for the commercial aerospace industry manufactured by  FormAlloy using DED-LB [708]. Other examples of freeform fabrication  by DED are shown elsewhere [709\u2013714]. It is important to note that the  DED is ideally suited for manufacturing large-scale complex structures  among all metal AM technologies.   5. The cladding of materials by DED   Laser cladding (LC) is a technique for adding coatings to the surface  of metallic components. DED AM is also known as 3D laser cladding  since it originally evolved from a robotic multilayer cladding process  [27,624]. When implemented as a cladding technique, DED involves  feeding powder or wire into a melt pool generated by an energy source  (for example laser or electron beam) as it scans across the target surface. In this  process, thin metallic or composite layers are deposited and fused to a  metallic component to improve their wear and corrosion resistance,  enhance performance, or replace material worn away.  The DED-based cladding has multiple advantages over other coating  techniques [624,625]: (1) a metallurgical bond is created between the  substrate and the coating material, which is much stronger than the  mechanical bond created using a thermal spray, arc welding, or plating  techniques; (2) DED cladding provides a controllable low heat input  with minimal dilution and HAZ, minimizing stresses and distortions  within the deposited materials; (3) fine microstructures can be achieved  in DED cladding due to the high cooling rates; (4) DED instrumentation  allows for precise control of coating size, shape, location, and thickness;  (5) a wide range of alloys and composites are compatible with DED  cladding. Additionally, DED cladding enables the deposition of   multilayer and multi-material (for example functionally graded [32]) coatings.  Finally, cladding onto curved surfaces and multi-axis cladding are also  possible with DED [626,627].  Most materials that have been investigated for LC applications can  also be deposited via DED-based cladding. These materials include  various alloys [27,624], metallic glasses [412], and MMCs containing  ceramics or intermetallic reinforcements [624,628]. The alloys that  have been laser cladded include Ni-, Co-, Ti-, Nb-, Al-, Mg-, and Cu-based  alloys, stainless steels, and tool steels [629\u2013631]. The general objective  of cladding is to enhance wear and corrosion resistance, and materials  with  these  attributes  are  generally  hardfacing  alloys  for  high-temperature applications, making them difficult to process in bulk  form but processable by cladding. The high-temperature oxidation  resistance of cladding Ni-based alloys can be improved by adding  rare-earth elements, such as Hf, Mo, Nb, or Y [629,632]. Intermetallic  compounds can precipitate during cooling, and hot and cold cracking  can appear in the cladded coating [633]. Pre- or post-heat treatment can  help to avoid these problems [634].  Cladding of MMCs containing ceramic or intermetallic re\u00ad  inforcements onto metallic substrates has been the subject of extensive  research. MMCs tend to have low ductility and fracture toughness,  making them challenge to process by conventional manufacturing pro\u00ad cesses, such as casting or P/M. Generally, there are two approaches for  cladding of MMCs. One approach uses a mixture of metal and ceramic  particles projected into the melt pool formed by the laser beam with a  limited reaction between the ceramic and metals [635\u2013640] or injecting  ceramic particles into the melt pool. In this approach, the ceramic par\u00ad ticles are bonded to the surface of the metallic substrate. In general,  ceramic particles are not easily wetted by a liquid metal, although the  ceramic particles\u2019 feeding efficiency and wettability can be improved by  using metal-coated ceramic particles [412,416]. One of the main chal\u00ad lenges for fabricating high-quality MMC coatings is an inhomogeneous  distribution of ceramic particles in the coating, which can be caused by  the differences in density and wettability between ceramic and metallic  particles. Nevertheless, powder mixtures with ceramic WC [636,639],  TiC [637,640], or SiC [638,641] particles have been successfully laser  cladded, and some minor reactions between the ceramic particles and  metallic matrix were observed. The second approach for cladding of  MMC coatings involves in situ reactions between the ingredients from  the powder or substrate within the melt pool, such as additions of Mo, Si,  and C powder in cladding for MoSi2 and SiC particle formation [642],  and TiC, TiN, and SiC reinforced Ti3Al intermetallic matrix composite  coatings in situ synthesized on a Ti substrate [643]. The in situ formed  fine ceramic particles are typically well bonded to the matrix, enhancing  the mechanical performance of the cladded MMC coatings [644]. The  microstructure evolution, hardness, wear resistance, and corrosion  resistance of different laser cladded coatings have been thoroughly  investigated in recent years [624]. Results show that both wear and  corrosion resistance were significantly improved when compared with  those of uncladded materials. Fig. 16 shows the microstructure and  properties of some cladded samples using DED processing.   6. Repair using DED   Repair or remanufacturing is restoring worn-out components into  their original shape to regain the performance of the component.  Remanufacturing or repairing high-value metal parts is of significant  interest due to cost savings and minimum downtime for machines.  Moreover, repairing parts or remanufacturing from scrap help sustain\u00ad able manufacturing by efficiently managing natural resources and  minimizing waste generation [646]. The high-performance and  high-value industrial components that are used in aerospace, naval,  automobile,  turbine,  and  machine  tools  encounter  severe  thermo-mechanical loadings during operation that cause wear, fatigue  cracking, and corrosion-related damage on the surface [647]. For  instance, under high temperature and pressure operation, gas turbine   Fig. 15.

In addition,  the tip of turbine blades is often damaged due to rubbing against the  stator liner, which affects the turbine\u2019s performance [19]. Conventional  techniques, such as welding and thermal spraying, have been used for  repairing worn components. However, most of these processes are less  precise, ad-hoc, and may require extensive machining. In TIG welding,  the high operational temperature (around 5500 \u25e6C) negatively affects  the repaired components\u2019 microstructure. Furthermore, repairing for  curved blade and disk is complex, more costly, and less reliable [648].  Therefore, the AM-based automated repairing method has been helpful  for complex geometries to maintain tight tolerances for the actual parts.  The Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL), on a scale of 1\u201310 (10  being most mature), is a measure developed by the United States  Department of Defense (DoD) to assess the maturity of manufacturing   readiness. Accordingly, the repair by LENS\u2122 of an injection mold tool  made of H13 tool steel attained MRL 10 already in 2011. LENS\u2122 has  also been used to repair the T700 jet engine\u2019s disk made from AM355  steel and the leading edge of a Ti6Al4V airfoil, adding a Co-based wear-  resistant alloy [649\u2013652]. In addition, the US Army\u2019s Anniston Army  Depot has been using LENS\u2122 systems to repair some gas turbine engine  components for the M1 Abrams Tank, while the US Army has been using  LENS\u2122 for its Mobile Parts Hospital (MPH) to provide a real-time  battlefield repair capability [653].   6[dot]1.

The DED-LB process shows  minimal distortion due to localized heating with controlled heat input  and exhibits good metallurgical bonds, low dilution, and narrow HAZ  [654]. Several researchers studied the repaired parts\u2019 microstructure,  interfacial bonding, and mechanical behavior and compared them with  the as-built and conventionally processed components. DED deposits  generate finer microstructure due to fast cooling rate, exhibit superior  mechanical properties than castings, and are at par with wrought  products [654]. DED is the most suitable and widely used method for  repairing high-valued components among other metal AM techniques.  Its unique characteristics include high material deposition rate, possi\u00ad bility to deposit multi-material, and no need for powder bed. Fig. 17  shows DED-LB repairing a worn anti-rotation bracket of military aircraft  [655]. The repairing of such components reduced the lead time, and the  post-machining  component  successfully  met  the  Air  Force\u2019s  re-certification criterion [655].  The development of high-quality DED repaired parts requires precise  control of process parameters. The DED technique is susceptible to the  process variables, including laser power, laser scanning speed, powder  feed rate, hatch spacing, laser beam diameter, laser scanning pattern,  etc [656]. Apart from these measurable parameters, variation in build  geometry and heat accumulation can alter the melt-pool temperature,  geometry, and layer height that control the quality of the repaired parts  in terms of dimensional accuracy, defects, microstructure, and proper\u00ad ties [657]. Therefore, real-time monitoring of measurable process vari\u00ad ables via advanced sensing technologies and feedback control systems  would improve repair quality and integrity [658]. Table 3 lists some  high-value components repaired using DED.   6[dot]2. Repair methodology   The maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) sector follow the  following basic process chains, shown in Fig. 18, during adaptive  repairing or remanufacturing of components: (1) pre-repair examina\u00ad tion; (2) pre-repair processing; (3) DED processing; (4) subtractive  machining; and (5) repair quality examination [673]. To access the  subsurface cracks and considering the inaccessible geometrical defects,  pre-repair processing includes pre-repair machining, which is a crucial  step that can influence metallurgical bonding [673,674]. Zhang et al explained that defective material removal around inaccessible defect  sites or building steep walls after machining could lead to cracks in  turbine blade edges after repair [673]. Fig. 19 shows the pre-repair  machining of the defect site to create the optimal contour for AM  deposition. Further, the digitization of damaged parts into a 3D CAD  model is an important step and carried out using a reverse engineering  process. In reverse engineering, several technologies are popularly used  for data acquisition, such as coordinate measurement machine (CMM),  structured light scanning, laser scanning, stereo scanning, etc, followed   Fig. 17.

Then, the repaired volume in the damaged part can be  achieved through a registration operation by comparing the nominal  CAD model with the 3D model of the defective part surface. Generally,  the nominal CAD model is compared to the actual digitized model to  minimize steps of the computerized numerical control (CNC) tool path  for machining and the laser tool path for depositing (Fig. 19b). In the  case of no nominal CAD availability, a reverse engineering process is  required to reconstruct the original surface model based on the 3D  model of the damaged surface. The surface reconstruction algorithm is  associated with a parametric representation that enables the manipu\u00ad lation of the surface geometry. Several studies showed adaptive repair of  components by the process of digitizing and meshing, and reconstruct\u00ad ing the geometry using non-uniform rational b-splines (NURBS) or  Prominent Cross-Section (PCS) based algorithm [5,676].  In the next step, the critical challenge for AM process is to deposit  materials in the damaged area to restore the missing geometry, main\u00ad taining tolerance and surface roughness. The AM process needs to  automatically adapt and modify the laser tool path and process pa\u00ad rameters for superior repair quality based on orientation, dimension,  and shape. For example, thinner sections of the damaged part require  less laser power, as less heat input reduces the finished part\u2019s HAZ. The  coarse surface finish of the DED repaired part requires post-processing  machining. CNC machining of the repaired component must achieve  the desired surface finish and dimensional accuracy for service. How\u00ad ever, machining of complex geometries can be an issue due to limited  tool accessibility. Machining also enhances the cost of repair and lead  time. Hybrid DED is becoming popular to repair components, where  DED-based AM is integrated with CNC machining to overcome these  limitations. Several studies showed that combining these two techniques  helps to produce parts with desirable accuracy [677,678].   7. Alloy design via DED   AM has changed how new alloys can be designed [11,658,659,679].  Pure metals are rarely used in any application as their properties are not  suitable to meet demanding applications. However, a small addition of  alloying elements to a pure metal can make a significant difference in  the properties of an alloy. Naturally, alloy design has become a new R&D  field of AM. Designing new alloys happens with an application requiring  extensive experimental capabilities, starting from high-temperature  furnaces for melting metals to post-processing heat-treatment set-up  and equipment for shaping, such as forging, extrusion, or rolling. For   the past five decades, efforts have been devoted to surface modifications  rather than using a new alloy as surface modifications are easy to do and  do not compromise bulk properties. Based on AM\u2019s unique processing  capabilities, new developments in this area are among the most exciting  aspects of the next wave of innovation in the field. And among different  types of metal AM technologies, DED is the most suitable technology  platform for alloy design as different powders in their elemental form  can be added at various chemistries and shaped simultaneously. And if a  hybrid DED is used, parts can also be machined during AM operation to  meet tight dimensional tolerances. The AM technology will revolu\u00ad tionize how different heritage alloy chemistries, such as Ti6Al4V and  316 SS, across numerous industries, can be redesigned for parts with  added functionality and increasing complexity, customization, and  consolidation for enhanced efficiency [680]. One example is alloy  chemistries in biomedical devices. The metallic biomedical devices  primarily use three different alloys \u2013 commercially pure and Ti6Al4V,  316L SS, and CoCr alloy. For load-bearing implants, Ti6Al4V is the most  used alloy. However, the biocompatibility or in vivo tissue-material in\u00ad teractions of Ti6Al4V is not optimal. The current solution is to design  various coating systems to enhance the biocompatibility and osseoin\u00ad tegration of the Ti6Al4V alloy. Some of these coatings include porous  tantalum coating, porous titanium coating, or calcium phosphate (CaP)  [681] coating. Minimal effort has been devoted to innovating new  Ti-based alloys that can show better biocompatibility in vivo. It is also  important to realize that Ti6Al4V was never initially developed for  biomedical devices. This alloy was designed for aerospace applications,  keeping high-temperature applications and fatigue resistance in mind.  Excellent fatigue and corrosion resistance of Ti6Al4V alloy helped its  original transformation in biomedical devices. It is important to note  that the challenge is to design a new alloy and find a vendor who can  manufacture those compositions on an industrial scale. And the current  solution is \u2013 keep using the legacy alloys and only make surface modi\u00ad fications. Such an approach is also helpful from the regulatory approval  point of view for the biomedical device industries. However, now that  most babies born in the 21st century are expected to live 90+ years, new  alloys for biomedical devices that can serve longer than a typical 15  years are growing. And it is envisioned that the AM technology platform  will be used to accomplish such a goal.  Significant research on additive-based alloy design has been devoted  to Fe- and Ni-based systems. Dippo et al [682] demonstrated a modified  Inconel 625 chemistry using DED-LB. Using an industrial alloy devel\u00ad opment feeder (ADF) from FormAlloy, the solubility of alloying ele\u00ad ments in Inconel 625 was experimentally verified after CALPHAD  simulations. Hemmati et al [683] researched the effects of variable  Cr\u2013B\u2013Si amounts in Ni-based alloy on the microstructure and properties  when processed using laser-based AM. Li et al [684] investigated  compositional  effects  on  NiCrSi  alloys  using  a  simulated  high-cooling-rate processing setup. Significant work has been done on  titanium alloys as well. Zhang et al [685] demonstrated that Cu addi\u00ad tion to titanium reduces the tendency for columnar grain formation due  to high constitutional supercooling that causes heterogeneous nucle\u00ad ation. Copper\u2019s high diffusion rate in titanium at compositions ranging  from 3[dot]5 to 8[dot]5 wt% Cu enables eutectoid microstructures that signifi\u00ad cantly affect the alloy\u2019s strength and ductility. A set of studies from Mitra  et al and Bandyopadhyay et al [686,687] showed that the incorpora\u00ad tion of tantalum into titanium via DED-LB increases its biocompatibility.  The authors found that as low as 10 wt% Ta could be incorporated into  titanium to significantly increase the biological response of the alloy,  like pure tantalum. Overall, alloy design using DED is in its infancy, and  it is expected that more research will be done in the future with  commonly used alloys to make them more AM friendly, or designing  new alloys with superior performance to meet the ever-changing de\u00ad mands for high-efficiency materials in free-standing and coating/repair  applications.

Summary, current challenges, and future directions   Commercial DED systems have been available since the mid-1990s in  the US by Optomec, Inc. (Albuquerque, NM) based on technology  developed at the Sandia National Lab. Other leading DED technology  providers include DM3D [688], RPM Innovations [689], and Fraunhofer  [690], just to name a few. However, as with all metal AM technology  platforms, DED\u2019s entry into the marketplace was slow due to concerns  related to reproducibility of the parts, poor surface finish, and difficulty  in manufacturing complex-shaped freestanding parts. Unlike in the PBF  process, DED systems usually do not have any support materials avail\u00ad able, and naturally, complex-shaped parts were near impossible to make  with the first-generation machines that had one powder feeder hopper  and a 3-axis control of the build space. Since then, the DED technology  has advanced significantly, where commercial machines are now  available with more than 10 powder feeders, free axis deposition heads,  and CNC machining platform for hybrid systems. Complex parts are  easily doable with these new DED machines, although most machines  still have only three axes of freedom and two to three powder feeders. As  applications in repair, alloy design, surface modifications, and func\u00ad tionally graded structures are realized, DED-based AM is becoming  popular in various industrial applications [679,715]. DED has become  the primary metal AM technology platform for printing large free\u00ad standing parts, a challenging application for PBF systems. In a recent  study with NASA, DM3D manufactured a 10-ft tall full-scale RS25 nozzle  liner [691]. Any other AM approach cannot manufacture such unique  metal structures. While large freestanding parts are uniquely suited for  DED, for research machines, the need for a small amount of powder or  the ability to deposit multi-material structures have been the most  attractive features. Multiple vendors sell commercial DED systems  worldwide for reactive and non-reactive powders with or without a  hybrid CNC option. DED-based metal AM systems are primarily not  competing with the PBF systems but offer a complimentary  manufacturing capability. Research and industrial DED systems are used  extensively to repair high-value or legacy components, alloy design for  optimizing the materials chemistry for AM use or innovating new  chemistries, manufacturing large parts, adding a coated layer on existing  parts, or creating bimetallic or functionally graded structures. The DED  technology platform offers unique strengths to all challenging applica\u00ad tions over other metal AM systems. Naturally, sales of commercial DED  systems are growing and are expected to continue in the future. Apart  from the laser powder-based DED, welding-based systems, such as  WAAM, are also becoming popular, particularly for rapid deposition  rates for large parts. Applications of DED in different material systems  have been discussed throughout this manuscript with specific references  to unique compositions, processing histories, and related properties.  Among remaining challenges, the cost of the machine is always an issue  for any new technology, including the DED, for large-scale acceptance in  manufacturing practices. Prices for laser-based DED systems for  non-reactive materials have dropped significantly in recent years, and  the trend may continue in the future. Coaxial deposition heads have  become a standard feature in the most recent DED systems, improving  the deposition efficiency and part quality. Incorporating a machine  learning-based approach may minimize process optimization re\u00ad quirements in future machines. Although the focus in this article  remained on the DED and materials for DED, pre-processing and  post-processing issues are also critical. Surface functionalization of  metal powders, essentially processing core-shell powders [692,693], for  the printing of advanced MMCs is a relatively new direction of R&D.  Reusability of metal powders or avoiding mixing metal powders with  machining chips or other powder compositions during multi-material  builds are still issues that need further R&D. Post-processing treat\u00ad ments are also essential for any critical applications which require a  better understanding of the process-property relationships. The intro\u00ad duction of advanced characterization techniques to the AM arena is also  evolving. Techniques such as the dynamic pulse-echo technique (for   measurement of the elastic constants) offer higher accuracy, sensitivity,  and repeatability and the possibility to use relatively small samples  compared to traditional techniques [228,694]. Such techniques are ex\u00ad pected to become more common in material design, R&D, and quality  control of AM parts. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review  on DED of advanced materials which will be a valuable document for  engineers and scientists from academia, industry, and national labs  worldwide to continue innovating the next generation of materials and  structures for various applications.
