Lo, Xiao Wang*  INTRODUCTION: Cellular proteins are the final products of gene expression that execute cel- lular functions. To understand translational gene regulation, it is crucial to measure protein synthesis at single-cell and spatial resolution. Current ribosome profiling methods achieve transcriptome-wide translational analysis but lack spatial context. By contrast, imaging-based methods preserve spatial information but are not multiplexed. A scalable method for single- cell and spatially resolved profiling of protein synthesis is still needed.  RATIONALE: We introduce ribosome-bound mRNA mapping (RIBOmap), a highly multi- plexed method for spatial charting of protein synthesis at single-cell and subcellular resolu- tion. RIBOmap employs a targeted-sequencing strategy that selectively detects ribosome-bound mRNAs through a specific design of tri-probes. The tri-probe set consists of a splint DNA probe hybridized to ribosomal RNA and a pair  of padlock and primer probes hybridized to mRNAs, which together produce DNA ampli- cons with gene-unique barcodes through in situ amplification. These DNA amplicons are then embedded in a polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix and the gene-unique barcodes are read out through in situ sequencing. We validated the specificity of RIBOmap through the use of noncoding RNAs, translation inhibitor, in vitro transcribed mRNAs, and comparison with established ribosome profiling technology.  RESULTS: We applied RIBOmap to HeLa cells for a 981-gene multiplexed experiment and designed a multimodal RIBOmap imaging experiment to capture the cell-cycle phase and subcellular organelles. The results revealed cell- cycle\u2013dependent translation and subcellular localized mRNA translation in HeLa cells. We further applied RIBOmap to intact mouse brain tissue, measuring the translation of 5413 genes simultaneously. Leveraging the single-cell and  spatial resolutions of RIBOmap, we generated a single-cell spatial map of the mouse brain. By comparing the spatial translatomics generated by RIBOmap with spatial transcriptomics, we uncovered cell type\u2013specific and brain region\u2013 specific translational regulation.  CONCLUSION: RIBOmap presents a new spa- tially resolved single-cell translatomics technol- ogy, accelerating our understanding of protein synthesis in the context of subcellular architec- ture, cell types, and tissue anatomy. The pair- wise spatial translatomic and transcriptomic mapping enabled us to systematically identify cell type- and tissue-region\u2013specific translational regulation, paving the way for uncovering novel posttranscriptional gene regulation princi- ples and mechanisms that shape the proteome for cellular and tissue functions. RIBOmap by- passes complicated polysome isolation steps and genetic manipulation, making it promis- ing for studies in post hoc human tissue and disease samples. We anticipate that integrating RIBOmap with other imaging-based measure- ments will enable spatial multiomics mapping for a comprehensive understanding of biolog- ical systems.\u25aa  RESEARCH  Zeng et al, Science 380, 1337 (2023) 30 June 2023 1 of 1  The list of author affiliations is available in the full article. *Corresponding author.

      "text": "RESEARCH ARTICLE  \u25e5  SPATIAL OMICS Spatially resolved single-cell translatomics at molecular resolution  Hu Zeng1,2\u2020, Jiahao Huang1,2\u2020, Jingyi Ren1,2\u2020, Connie Kangni Wang2, Zefang Tang1,2, Haowen Zhou2, Yiming Zhou1,2,3, Hailing Shi1,2, Abhishek Aditham2,4, Xin Sui1,2, Hongyu Chen1,2, Jennifer A. Lo2, Xiao Wang1,2*  The precise control of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is a crucial step in posttranscriptional gene regulation of cellular physiology. However, it remains a challenge to systematically study mRNA translation at the transcriptomic scale with spatial and single-cell resolution. Here, we report the development of ribosome-bound mRNA mapping (RIBOmap), a highly multiplexed three-dimensional in situ profiling method to detect cellular translatome. RIBOmap profiling of 981 genes in HeLa cells revealed cell cycle\u2013dependent translational control and colocalized translation of functional gene modules. We mapped 5413 genes in mouse brain tissues, yielding spatially resolved single-cell translatomic profiles for 119,173 cells and revealing cell type\u2013specific and brain region\u2013specific translational regulation, including translation remodeling during oligodendrocyte maturation. Our method detected widespread patterns of localized translation in neuronal and glial cells in intact brain tissue networks. M  easuring genome-wide protein synthe- sis patterns with single-cell and spa- tial resolution can help us understand translational regulation in heteroge- neous cell types and states. Although large-scale single-cell and spatially resolved proteome profiling remains challenging (1), past research has focused on mapping mRNA levels to infer the corresponding protein abun- dances in single cells. However, numerous studies have revealed poor correlation between mRNA and protein levels (2\u20135), as gene regulation is achieved at both transcriptional and transla- tional levels. Moreover, many genes undergo signal-dependent and subcellular-localized translation (6). Therefore, we need scalable single-cell and spatially resolved profiling of protein synthesis for a comprehensive under- standing of gene expression and translational regulation. Existing bulk and single-cell ribosome pro- filing methods have enabled us to analyze pro- tein translation at the transcriptome scale (7\u201312) but cannot preserve spatial information. Cur- rent imaging-based methods that can trace mRNA translation with their physical coordi- nates (13\u201319) are limited to low gene through- put. Therefore, it remains challenging to achieve highly multiplexed spatial ribosome profiling in single cells with subcellular resolution. To  fill this gap, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) in situ ribosome-bound mRNA mapping method (RIBOmap) for highly multiplexed char- acterization of protein synthesis with single- cell and subcellular resolutions.  RIBOmap design and validation  RIBOmap is built upon a targeted-sequencing strategy in which a specific design of tri-probes selectively detects and amplifies ribosome- bound mRNAs (Fig. 1A and fig S1A). The RIBOmap tri-probe set includes: (i) a splint DNA probe that hybridizes to ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and serves as the splint to circularize the adjacent padlock probe; (ii) a padlock probe that targets specific mRNA species of interest and encodes a gene-unique barcode; (iii) a primer probe that targets the mRNA site adjacent to the one targeted by the pad- lock probe and serves as the primer for rolling circle amplification resulting in a DNA nano- ball (amplicon). DNA amplicon signals are only produced when all three probes are present in proximity (Fig. 1, B and C). The gene-unique barcodes in the DNA amplicons are then de- coded through in situ sequencing with error- reduction by dynamic annealing and ligation (Fig. 1A) (20). We also tested an alternative RIBOmap workflow that uses primary anti- bodies of ribosomal proteins (RPS3, RPL4) and splint-conjugated protein A/G to target ribosomes, which demonstrated a much lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than that of the rRNA targeting strategy (fig S1, B to G). Thus, we proceeded with the rRNA targeting strat- egy in the following studies. To confirm that RIBOmap specifically tar- gets ribosome-bound mRNAs, we designed  four experiments. First, RIBOmap and pre- viously reported STARmap RNA imaging (20) were used to detect protein-encoding ACTB mRNA and two negative controls of noncod- ing RNAs (Fig. 2A and table S1). As expected, RIBOmap only detected cytoplasmic ACTB mRNAs whereas STARmap detected both ACTB mRNA and the noncoding RNAs (Fig. 2, B and C and fig S2). Second, RIBOmap spe- cificity was validated using Harringtonine, a translation inhibitor that traps translation- initiating ribosomes at the start codon (21) (Fig. 2D). After Harringtonine treatment, there was a significant decrease in RIBOmap signal intensity using probes targeting 115 or 405 nu- celotides (nt) downstream of the start codon, whereas there was minimal decrease in the signal generated by the probe targeting the \u221216 nt from the start codon (Fig. 2, E to G). Third, we used synthetic in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNAs and lipid-mediated transfec- tion (Fig. 2H). Our data demonstrated that STARmap could detect both small puncta cor- responding to free cytosolic mRNAs and larger intracellular granules corresponding to lipid transfection vesicles containing many copies of nontranslating mRNAs, whereas RIBOmap signals were depleted in lipid transfection vesi- cles (Fig. 2, I and J), indicating that RIBOmap does not detect nontranslating mRNAs. Fi- nally, we validated RIBOmap by comparing it with RiboLace, an established ribosome pro- filing technology (22). RIBOmap successfully detected differentially translated mRNAs in starved versus control human MCF7 cells, which is consistent with the reported RiboLace and proteomics measurements (22) (fig S3). Together, these results demonstrate the spe- cificity of RIBOmap in detecting ribosome- bound mRNAs.  Multiplexed RIBOmap in cultured cells  After benchmarking the SNR and specificity of RIBOmap, we performed a highly multi- plexed 981-gene RIBOmap experiment in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). The 981 genes represent a curated list composed of cell-cycle gene markers, genes with diverse subcellular RNA patterns, and genes of varying RNA stabilities (23\u201326) (table S2). We designed a multimodal RIBOmap im- aging experiment that further incorporated the information on cell-cycle stages and sub- cellular organelles: (i) the cell-cycle phase of each cell was captured by the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicators (FUCCI) (27, 28); (ii) ribosome-bound mRNAs (981 genes) were in situ sequenced; (iii) finally, nuclei, en- doplasmic reticulum, and cell shapes were stained and imaged (Fig. 3B). We also con- ducted a paired STARmap experiment for comparison (Fig. 3A). In total, RIBOmap and STARmap sequenced 1813 and 1757 cells, re- spectively (fig S4A).

      "text": "3D was 0[dot]69 mm for RIBOmap and 0[dot]61 mm for STARmap (fig S4, B and C), indicating that both techniques have high spatial resolution. To assess the reliability of RIBOmap in multi- plexed experiments, we calculated the corre- lation between the RIBOmap results for 981 genes with published HeLa proteome and ribosome profiling datasets (26, 29, 30). The results showed that the correlation between RIBOmap and the proteome dataset is com- parable to that between the ribosome profiling dataset and the proteome dataset (fig S4D). Additionally, the correlation between RIBO- map and the two ribosome profiling datasets is comparable to the correlation between the two ribosome profiling datasets (fig S4E).  Next, we evaluated whether RIBOmap can decipher cell cycle\u2013dependent mRNA transla- tion. The results showed that the G1, G1/S, and G2/M cell cycle phases identified from both RIBOmap and STARmap datasets agreed with the expected cell cycle\u2013dependent patterns of FUCCI protein fluorescence (Fig. 3C and fig S5), demonstrating the accuracy of RIBOmap in delineating cell states. We then identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across cell cycle phases using RIBOmap and STARmap data (fig S6, A and B, and table S3). Most of the RIBOmap DEGs overlapped with known cell cycle\u2013dependent genes (31) (fig S6C). We also identified DEGs detected in RIBOmap but not in STARmap (fig S6D). One example is NOL6  (nucleolar protein 6), whose translation was significantly decreased from the G1 phase to the G2/M phase as detected by both RIBOmap and ribosome profiling (32), but whose overall RNA level showed little change across cell cycle phases as detected by STARmap and RNA-seq (fig S6, E to G). Next, to leverage the single-cell resolution in our dataset, we performed gene-expression co- variation analysis and identified five coregulated translation modules (RTMs) with substantial intramodule correlation, each with enrichment of distinct functional pathways (RTMs 1 to 5, Fig. 3D, fig S7, A to E, and table S4). RTM 3 and RTM 5 are enriched for G2/M and G1/S cell cycle marker genes, respectively (Fig. 3D,  Zeng et al, Science 380, eadd3067 (2023) 30 June 2023 2 of 10  Hydrogel-tissue chemistry  and SEDAL sequencing  Ribosome-bound mRNA  Signal readout  Non-translating RN T A ri-probes  DNA amplicon  In situ single-cell  translatome with subcellular localization  A  Lacking splint probe  No DNA amplicon  B  Tri-probes  Without primer probe  Without splint probe  Incomplete splint probe  0[dot]0  0[dot]5  1[dot]0  1[dot]5  Signal intensity (normalized to DAPI)  C  Barcode  Tri-probes  (A)n (A)n  (A)n  Ribosome  5' Cap  18S rRNA  3' Blocked splint probe  Barcoded primer probe  Without primer probe Without splint probe  Barcoded padlock probe  Incomplete splint probe, without rRNA hybridization part  10 \u00b5m   Ligation  A  AAGTTAC TTGCACT TTGCACT  GTACTTA  Translating gene 1  Translating gene 2  Translating gene 3  Translating gene n  C G T  A C G T  ** ** **  (A)n (A)n  NH2  NH2  NH2  NH2 5'  3'  3' 5'P  5'  3' 3' 5'P  5'  3' 3' 5'P  Circularized padlock probe Linear padlock probe  Rolling circle amplification  Decode Annotate  Hybridization Splint probe hybridized to rRNA  (A)n (A)n  5'  3'  5'  3' 3' 5'P  N  N  N  N  N  A  A  \u2026 \u2026  (A)n (A)n (A)n (A)n  DNA amplicon DAPI  Fig. 1.

After the sample is prepared, a paired barcoded padlock probe and primer probe are hybridized to a targeted intracellular RNA, and the splint probe is hybridized to 18S rRNA of ribosomes. The splint probe is used as a template for the proximity ligation to circularize the padlock probe. The intact padlock probe can then be amplified to generate amine-modified DNA amplicons in situ. Next, these DNA amplicons are copolymerized into hydrogel through tissue-hydrogel chemistry for in situ sequencing. The gene-unique barcode  sequence (red) in the cDNA amplicons can then be read out through cyclic in situ sequencing. (B) Tri-probe strategy.

      "text": "right), and are negatively correlated (fig S7F). Moreover, RTM 2 contains genes encoding protein translation machineries (fig S7D); these genes show a positive correlation with RTM 5 (G1/S marker genes) and a negative correlation with RTM 3 (G2/M marker genes) (fig S7G). This observation suggests that the  protein translation machinery is up-regulated in the G1/S phase to support the demand for protein products as cells enlarge and subcel- lular organelles are replicated. Subcellular localized translation has impli- cations for signal transduction and proteome organization (6). Using RIBOmap results, we  identified five colocalized translation modules (LTMs) with highly correlated subcellular spa- tial organizations and distinct functional en- richment (LTMs 1 to 5, Fig. 3, E to G, fig S8, A to C, and table S4).

In- deed, 62[dot]2 and 94[dot]6% of LTM4 genes over- lapped with the proximity ribosome profiling dataset (8) and APEX-RIP dataset (33), respec- tively (Fig. 3J, fig S8D, and table S4), suggest- ing the accuracy of RIBOmap for subcellular spatial analysis. By contrast, LTMs 1 and 3 are enriched for genes encoding large protein complexes of the mitotic spindle and trans- lation machinery, respectively (Fig. 3, F and G, and fig S8, A and C). This observation sug- gests that the subunits of large protein com- plexes may be synthesized in spatial proximity for efficient assembly. Finally, we explored whether coregulated genes tend to be colo- calized for translation and found that the five RTMs also show strong subcellular colocaliza- tion (fig S8G). These results may imply that functionally related gene groups can be coreg- ulated through subcellular colocalized trans- lation, possibly through shared regulatory RNA elements or protein-protein interactions be- tween nascent proteins.  RIBOmap in intact mouse brain tissue  We then applied RIBOmap to mouse brain slices to reveal single-cell translatome profiles in intact tissues. We mapped a targeted gene list of 5413 genes (table S5) curated from pre- viously published single-cell sequencing studies of mouse cell atlas (34\u201340). We imaged two biological replicates of the mouse hemisphere coronal sections (60,481 cells for Rep1 and 58,692 cells for Rep2) containing multiple brain regions (Fig. 4, A and B). We benchmarked tissue RIBOmap data by comparing the spatial translation pattern of well-known cell-type marker genes and neurotransmitter genes with corresponding in situ hybridization (ISH) im- ages from the Allen Brain database (41) (Fig. 4C and fig S9), where the comparison showed consistent spatial patterns. The data quality of RIBOmap is comparable to previous STARmap PLUS data (42) (fig S10A). Notably, we observed a high correlation (Pearson r = 0[dot]95) between the two RIBOmap replicates (fig S10B), validat- ing the reproducibility of RIBOmap. Encouraged by the benchmarking results, we then adopted a hierarchical clustering strat- egy (20, 36) to identify cell types (fig S10, C to E), resulting in 11 major cell types and 38 sub- types (Fig. 4, D and E, fig S10, C to E, and fig S11). The cross-reference analyses revealed good correspondence between RIBOmap cell clusters and published regional scRNA-seq  results of cell types (35) (fig S10D). Based on these cell typing results, we generated spa- tial cell maps from the imaged hemibrain region (Fig. 4, F and G and fig S12). This spa- tial cell-type map is consistent with previous reports (36), demonstrating the potential of RIBOmap single-cell translatomics to compre- hensively identify diverse brain cell types and regions.  Cell type\u2013specific and brain region\u2013specific translational regulation in mouse brain  To compare the RIBOmap results with spa- tial transcriptomics, we conducted pairwise STARmap on a brain slice adjacent to RIBOmap sample followed by data integration for joint analyses (Fig. 5A). We observed consistent cell typing results between the two methods with respect to gene expression, cell-type com- position, and spatial distribution of cell types (Fig. 5A and fig S13). We also performed im- munostaining of NeuN and GFAP proteins during RIBOmap and STARmap sample prep- aration and observed clear enrichment of NeuN protein signal in neurons and GFAP protein signal in astrocytes, respectively, in both sam- ples (fig S14), further supporting the accuracy of the cell typing results. Leveraging the single-cell and spatial reso- lution of paired RIBOmap and STARmap data, we analyzed the heterogeneity of translational regulation across cell types and brain regions. We determined the reads correlation of 5413 genes between the two datasets for individual cell types or tissue regions (Fig. 5, B and C). Lower correlation scores indicate a greater degree of translational regulation, resulting in disparities between the translatome and the transcriptome. We found that non-neuronal cell types, especially oligodendrocytes, have lower correlation scores between translatome and transcriptome than neuronal cell types (Fig. 5B). Correspondingly, fiber tracts, the brain region where oligodendrocytes are en- riched, had the lowest correlation (Pearson r = 0[dot]58) between the translatome and transcrip- tome among the eight brain regions (Fig. 5C). This suggests a previously undercharacterized level of translational regulation in glial cells, particularly in oligodendrocytes. To further pinpoint translationally regulated genes across various cell types, we performed gene clustering using major cell-type\u2013resolved RIBOmap and STARmap profiles and identi- fied 15 gene modules with distinct gene func- tions and expression patterns (fig S15, A and  B, and table S6). Given that the oligodendro- cyte lineage showed the lowest correlation between translatome and transcriptome among major cell types (Fig. 5C), we focused on gene modules that were highly expressed in oligo- dendrocyte lineage cells (240 genes; fig S15A and table S6). Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed the differentiation path of the oligo- dendrocyte lineage in our datasets (40), from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) to oligo- dendrocyte subtype 1 (OLG1), then to oligo- dendrocyte subtype 2 (OLG2) (Fig. 5, D and E). This is supported by the increased expression gradients of genes involved in myelination (Plp1 and Mbp) along oligodendrocyte matu- ration (Fig. 5F) (43), and by the spatial enrich- ment of the more mature OLG2 in fiber tracts for myelination-based axon ensheathment (Fig. 5, G and H). To correlate translational regulation with oligodendrocyte subtypes and maturation, we further clustered oligodendrocyte-related gene modules using their subtype-resolved translatome and transcriptome profiles in the oligodendrocyte lineage (Fig. 5I, and table S6). We detected three gene modules: Module 1 and Module 2 have consistent patterns between RIBOmapand STARmapwiththehighestsignals in OPC and OLG2 for most genes, respectively, whereas Module 3 has the highest RIBOmap signal in OLG2 but the highest STARmap signal in OLG1 for most genes (Fig. 5I). This obser- vation suggested strong translational regulation for genes in Module 3. We further calculated the relative translation efficiency (RTE) for each gene using their ratio of RIBOmap and STARmap signals and found that genes in Module 3 had higher RTE in OLG2 than OLG1 and OPC (Fig. 5I). GO analysis revealed that Module 3 genes are involved in myelin sheath (that is Cldn11 and Tspan2) (Fig. 5, J and K). Spa- tial analysis of Module 3 RTE patterns and representative genes across brain regions also showed the highest RTE value in the fiber tracts, where OLG2 is enriched (Fig. 5, L to O, and fig S16A). We experimentally verified one example gene Cldn11 and found that Claudin 11 (the protein product of Cldn11) immunostaining correlated better with Cldn11 RIBOmap signal than STARmap signal, validating the accuracy of the spatial translatomic pattern we observed (fig S16, B to E). Overall, through the integra- tive analysis of RIBOmap and STARmap results in the mouse brain, we identified gene modules that are translationally regulated during the maturation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells across different brain regions.

      "text": "suggests substantial translation remodeling. This may functionally serve to augment the protein production for axon ensheathment and may be mechanistically relevant to the recent report on altered tRNA modification during oligodendrocyte maturation (44). To systematically uncover genes with dif- ferential spatial patterns between transla- tome and transcriptome across brain regions,  we performed gene clustering using region- resolved RIBOmap and STARmap profiles and identified gene modules with distinct spatial patterns between RIBOmap and STARmap across different brain regions (for example Module 7, fig S17, A to C, and table S6). For example, G protein subunit gamma 2 (Gng2) in Module 7 has a low RIBOmap signal in the thalamus, which is consistent with the protein signal  (extracted from the HPA database) and less correlated with the STARmap signal (fig S17, D to I). By contrast, the RNA ISH signals of Gng2 from the Allen Brain database (41) cor- related better with the STARmap signal than RIBOmap (fig S17, J to M). These results were consistent with previous studies in which the translatome is better correlated with the pro- teome than the transcriptome (7, 11, 12).

      "text": "Subcellular localized mRNA translation in mouse brain In addition to brain-wide anatomical analysis, we investigated potential translational con- trol at the subcellular level. In the brain tissue, subcellular localized translation in the cell body (soma) and periphery branches (processes) serves as a critical mechanism to assemble and adjust the network of neuronal and glial cells (45\u201350) in response to physiological signals during neurodevelopment and memory. To dissect localized translation in the somata and processes of neuronal and glial cells, we di- vided the RIBOmap reads into somata reads (that is inside the cell body area identified by ClusterMap) (51) and processes reads (that is the rest of the reads) (Fig. 6, A to C). Next, we defined the top 10% of genes with the highest and lowest processes-to-somata ratios as processes- and somata-enriched translation genes, respec- tively (Fig. 6D and table S7). GO analysis showed that processes-enriched translation genes are associated with translation machinery and postsynaptic density (Fig. 6E and fig S18A). By contrast, somata-enriched translation genes are associated with the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix (Fig. 6F and fig S18B), corresponding to localized translation at the ER in the somata. Notably, we observed abun- dant processes-enriched translation signals in hippocampal neuropils (Fig. 6G and fig S18C). By contrast, the somata-enriched translation genes showed sparse RIBOmap signals in hip- pocampal neuropils (Fig. 6H and fig S18D), which may be associated with ER translation. Beyond neuronal genes, we also observed lo- calized translation in glial cells (Fig. 6, I and J, and fig S18, E and F). Overall, we demon- strated that RIBOmap can be used to study subcellular-localized translation in processes of both neuronal and glial cells of the mouse brain tissue. In summary, RIBOmap is a spatial trans- latomics method with single-cell and molec- ular resolution, which can be used to study mRNA regulation and protein synthesis in in- tact cellular and tissue networks. In contrast to existing approaches, RIBOmap bypasses complicated polysome isolation steps and genetic manipulation, thus holding promise for spatial and single-cell resolved studies in post hoc human tissue and disease samples. The detection efficiency and spatial resolu- tion of RIBOmap can be further increased by combining with super-resolution imaging, expansion microscopy, and sparse labeling (52) to further illustrate translational events in fine subcellular structures (for example dissecting dendritic and axonic mRNA translation in neurons). It is noteworthy that the accuracy of RTE analysis depends on the precise joint cell typing of RIBOmap and STARmap data. Therefore, further computational develop- ment to improve the cross-modality integra-  tion of various spatial omics modalities will significantly enhance the analysis and inter- pretation of RIBOmap. Whereas RIBOmap in this manuscript focuses on mapping RNA translation, such proximity-based tri-probe design can be readily adapted to study RNA- RNA interactions, RNA-protein interactions, and RNA modifications. In the future, we en- vision that RIBOmap can be combined with other imaging-based measurements to enable spatial multiomics mapping of epigenome, transcriptome, and translatome in the same samples for an integrative understanding of biological systems.

DOI: 10[dot]1126/science.add3067  Editor\u2019s summary A long-held goal of biological research is to measure protein translation with spatially resolved, single-cell resolution. Existing methods such as ribosome profiling measure protein translation as an average of many cells and lack spatial resolution. Zeng et al developed a highly multiplexed, ribosome-bound messenger RNA imaging technique called RIBOmap and applied it in single cells in situ to profile translation events with spatial coordinates (see the Perspective by Fan). Thousands of genes were simultaneously mapped in intact cells and tissues at molecular resolution, revealing the regulatory principles that specify the location and efficiency of protein production for functionally relevant gene programs across different cell types and tissue regions. \u2014Di Jiang  View the article online https://www[dot]science[dot]org/doi/10[dot]1126/science[dot]add3067 Permissions https://www[dot]science[dot]org/help/reprints-and-permissions  Downloaded from https://www[dot]science[dot]org at Osaka University on August 19, 2023",
