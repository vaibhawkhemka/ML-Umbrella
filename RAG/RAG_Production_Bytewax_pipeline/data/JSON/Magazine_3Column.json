To that end, standardization bodies have  created new study and working groups to  investigate the anticipated challenges to 5G   New Radio-Unlicensed (NR-U) and Wi-Fi  coexistence. In this article, we present an  integrated overview of the latest advances  in the standardization of LTE- LAA/Wi-Fi  (5 GHz) and 5G NR-U/Wi-Fi 6 (6 GHz)  coexistence. We analyze the challenges in  fair NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence in the   6 GHz spectrum, with a futuristic vision   for seamless coexistence in all subsequent  spectrum that may be allocated for unli- censed operation.  The growing penetration of high-end  consumer devices (smartphones, tablets,  etc) running bandwidth-hungry applications    (for example mobile multimedia streaming) has led  to a commensurate surge in demand for  mobile data (pegged to soar up to 77 exabytes  by 2022). An anticipated second wave will  result from the emerging Augmented/Virtual  Reality (AR/VR) industry and more broadly,  the Internet-of-Things that will connect  an unprecedented number of intelligent  devices to next-generation (5G and beyond)  mobile networks. These must therefore greatly  expand their aggregate network capacity to  meet this challenge. This is being achieved  by a combination of approaches, including  use of multi-input, multi-output (MIMO)  techniques, network densification (that is deploying small cells) and more efficient traffic  management and radio resource allocation.  Since licensed spectrum is a limited and  expensive resource, its optimal utilization   S  mall-cell LTE and Wi-Fi networks are both currently deployed  in the unlicensed 5 GHz bands globally, leading to the need for  new coexistence regulations between two very different access  technologies. 3GPP standardized LTE Licensed Assisted Access  (LTE-LAA) addresses the above coexistence challenge with Wi-Fi through  incorporation of similar sensing and back-off features. The success of  LAA\u2019s fair and efficient coexistence with Wi-Fi can be considered a  benchmark for collaborative cellular operation in unlicensed bands.",

LTE-LAA WI-FI COEXISTENCE:  OVERVIEW  3GPP Release 13 (completed December  2015) defined LTE-LAA and catalyzed an  industry-led exploration of LTE/Wi-Fi  coexistence [7] in 5 GHz unlicensed band.  Due to the very different underlying PHY/ MAC design philosophies of the two systems,  particularly vis-a-vis channel access, it was  anticipated that co-location of LTE-LAA and  Wi-Fi would likely impact performance of  the two constituent systems unequally.  The coexistence fairness is impacted  by multiple factors viz, the contention  parameters for channel access, the sensing  threshold, and the transmission duration  [8] explored the relative issue of differing  channelization\u2019s (that is channel bandwidth  asymmetry) between LTE and Wi-Fi. Their  results demonstrate that smaller bandwidth  LTE-LAA transmission (for example 1[dot]25 or 5 MHz)    have a noticeable impact on Wi-Fi perform-  ance. Thus the latter is dependent on the  location of the LTE-LAA frequency band   may require spectrum sharing between  multiple network operators/providers of  different types \u2013 increasingly licensed- unlicensed sharing is being contemplated to  enhance network spectral efficiency, beyond  the more traditional unlicensed-unlicensed  sharing. As the most common unlicensed  incumbent, Wi-Fi is now broadly deployed  in the unlicensed 5 GHz band in North  America where approximately 500 MHz   of bandwidth is available. However, these   5 GHz unlicensed bands are also seeing  increasing deployment of cellular services   such as LTE Licensed Assisted Access (LTE- LAA). Recently, the Federal Communi-  cations Commission (FCC) sought to open  up 1[dot]2 GHz of additional spectrum for  unlicensed operation in the 6 GHz band  through a Notice of Proposed Rule Making  (NPRM) [1]. This allocation of spectrum  for unlicensed operation will thus only  accelerate the need for further coexistence  solutions among heterogeneous systems. However, the benefits of spectrum sharing  are not devoid of challenges, the foremost  being the search for effective coexistence  solutions between cellular (LTE and 5G)  and Wi-Fi networks, whose medium  access control (MAC) protocols are very  different. While cellular systems employ a  Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)/ Frequency Division Multiple Access  (FDMA) scheduling mechanism, Wi-Fi  depends on the Carrier Sense Multiple  Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/ CA) mechanism. As a consequence there  have been multiple standardization efforts  to facilitate LTE/Wi-Fi coexistence \u2013 notably  LTE-U [2] and LTE-LAA [3]. The former  was developed by an industry group, the  LTE-U Forum, while 3GPP developed the  LTE-LAA standard. Both standards facilitate  LTE Wi-Fi coexistence, albeit through  different mechanisms. The LTE-LAA  standard employs a Listen Before Talk (LBT)  mechanism quite similar to the CSMA/CA  of Wi-Fi. In contrast, LTE-U relies on an  adaptive duty cycling approach \u2013 termed  as Carrier Sense Adaptive Transmission  (CSAT) \u2013 based on its estimate of Wi-Fi   activity through carrier sensing. In numerous  circumstances, LTE-U/Wi-Fi coexistence  has been shown to perform poorly [4]. The  reasons are manifold but two are prominent:  a) LTE-U\u2019s duty-cycle mechanism often  initiates LTE transmissions during active   Wi-Fi transmissions, causing co-channel  interference, which in turn lowers data- rates and increases transmission errors, and  b) the carrier sense mechanisms of LTE-U  and Wi-Fi are inherently asymmetric [2].  Moreover, LBT for systems in the unlicensed  bands, while not mandatory in the US, is  required in most of the rest of the world. As a  result, adoption of LTE-U by cellular carriers  has been very limited to date, and 3GPP- standardized LTE-LAA is the predominant  coexistence mechanism in practice, and will  be our sole focus in this article. The coexistence of Wi-Fi and LTE-LAA  leads to many research challenges such as  optimizing the energy detection threshold of  LTE-LAA, dynamic adjustment of conten- tion window size for fair sharing, resource  allocation, and interference management.   A fundamental aspect of coexistence among  dissimilar networks such as Wi-Fi and LTE- LAA is whether the sharing is fair in any  acceptable sense. Clearly, there are several  well-accepted notions of sharing among  networks \u2013 among which min-max and pro- portional fairness [5, 6] are well-recognized.  The 3GPP definition [7] states \u201cLAA design  should target fair coexistence with existing  Wi-Fi networks to not impact Wi-Fi services  more than an additional Wi-Fi network on the  same carrier, with respect to throughput and  latency. \u201d In other words, the definition merely  imposes a insensitivity requirement on   Wi-Fi performance and is oblivious to actual  LTE-LAA network throughput achieved in  such sharing scenarios. A detailed analysis  in [3] shows that the above definition does  not lead to \u201cfair sharing\u201d under well-accepted  fairness notions under many circumstances.  There are numerous factors on both sides that  impact any reasonable approach to fairness,  and an adequate definition is needed that  recognizes this complexity and seeks to  balance the rights of two rather dissimilar  networks. This 3GPP definition, which is  quite different from traditional notions of  fairness, has led to considerable dissonance  among the industrial research community.  Given a fairness definition consecrated  in the standard, it automatically becomes  a target to be met; however the inherent  definitional shortcomings like those noted  above are an impediment to actually achiev- ing any accepted notions of fairness. In this article, we describe the advances  in the standardization activities of LTE-",

In  [9], Rochman et al explored the effect of  energy detect (ED) threshold on Wi-Fi and  LTE-LAA via extensive simulations and  demonstrated that if both Wi-Fi and LTE  employed a sensing threshold of -82 dBm to  detect the other, overall throughput of both  coexisting systems improved, leading to   fair coexistence. On the other hand, Qualcomm [10]  investigated the coexistence of Wi-Fi with  LTE-LAA and LTE-U through simulation  and showed that significant throughput gain  can be achieved by aggregating LTE across  licensed and unlicensed spectrum. More  importantly, this throughput improvement  does not come at the expense of degraded  Wi-Fi performance and both technologies  can fairly share the unlicensed spectrum.  Ericsson in [11] explored aspects of LTE- LAA system downlink operation such  as dynamic frequency selection (DFS),  physical channel design, and radio resource  management (RRM). An enhanced LBT  approach was proposed for improving  coexistence of LTE-LAA and Wi-Fi and  results from a system-level simulation for  3GPP evaluation scenarios showed that fair  coexistence can be achieved in both indoor  and outdoor scenarios.  In summary, industry-driven research has  produced mixed results. Some studies predict  largely negative consequences for Wi-Fi  with the proposed LTE-LAA coexistence  mechanisms, and others claim that fair  coexistence is feasible with necessary tweaks  or enhancements. It is imperative that these  conflicting inferences and conclusions are  reconciled and attributed specifically to the  scenarios to which they apply. Meaningful  progress on this front requires a careful  and transparent approach inclusive of that is publishing results in the public based on  model-based analysis of the problem coupled  with experimentation and/or simulations  using open source components. While much of the coexistence effort  from industry is driven by fair sharing as  defined by 3GPP, academic research has  explored coexistence fairness issues from  a broader perspective. We next summarize  some recent prior art that has contributed  to this issue, including our own [12, 3]. [13]  explores design aspects of LBT schemes  for LTE-LAA as a means of providing  equal opportunity channel access in the   presence of Wi-Fi. Similarly [14] proposed  an enhanced LBT algorithm with contention  window size adaptation for LTE-LAA in  order to achieve fair channel access as well  as Quality of Service (QoS) fairness. In [15],  Cano and Leith derive the proportional  fair rate allocation 3 for Wi-Fi/LTE-LAA  (as well as Wi-Fi/LTE-U) coexistence. Also  in [16], fairness in coexistence of Wi-Fi/ LTE-LAA LBT based on the 3GPP criteria  is investigated through a custom-built  event-based system simulator. Their results  suggest that LBT (and correct choice of  LBT parameters) is essential to achieving  proportional fairness. In our work, we  bootstrapped on the analytical model  developed in [12] and enhanced it to include  the impact of different sensing duration  of Wi-Fi and LTE-LAA on respective  system throughput during coexistence. The  proposed new analytical model results were  further validated via a National Instrument  (NI) test-bed [12, 3]. Then, we explored  the issue of fair coexistence by comparing  results (coexistence system operating points)  from the 3GPP definition [3] to a scheme  that enforces proportional fairness whereby  each node in either network achieves the  same fraction-of-time access. The results  conclusively show that proportional fairness  is a much better notion than 3GPP fairness  and produces equitable results for both  networks in a larger variety of scenarios.  NEW STANDARDIZATION  EFFORTS IN 5 GHZ: LAA UPLINK  TRANSMISSIONS  LTE-LAA as specified by 3GPP in Release 13  adopted the LBT approach [3] for coexistence  with Wi-Fi and supported only downlink  (DL) transmissions in the unlicensed band:  a secondary cell (sCell) aggregated with a  licensed primary cell (pCell). Enhanced  LAA (eLAA) as specified in Release 14  supports uplink (UL) operation as well in   the unlicensed band as shown in Fig. 1(a).  However the legacy LTE UL scheduling  continued to be used in eLAA [17],  thus increasing the processing delay in  scheduling grants due to LBT procedures.  Hence, in April 2017, the \u201cfurther eLAA\u201d  (FeLAA) working group (in Release 15)  was started with the objective of improving  LAA DL and UL performance through  an enhanced support for autonomous UL  transmissions [18]. In the proposed FeLAA,  a UL transmission ought to receive a grant  from the eNB prior to the transmission,  which solves the constraint imposed by the  legacy eLAA.   FeLAA: eNB to UE Transmission  Opportunity Time (TXOP) Sharing [18]  Consider a particular base station (eNB)  which acquires a DL TXOP using LBT  with random backoff with variable size  contention window, that is CAT 4 LBT. Later,  the eNB can share the TXOP with another  UE for its UL without scheduling another  grant request. The only caveat is that the  total shared TXOP should not exceed the  Maximum TXOP (MTXOP) limit assigned  for the particular priority class [3]. In doing  so, the sharing mechanism facilitates a  relaxation for the UL transmission, which  otherwise necessitates that a user equipment  (UE) must schedule a grant before being  permitted to transmit. Key players in the  industry also proposed to incorporate this  mechanism for Autonomous UL (AUL),  especially since it does not suffer from  the characteristic shortcomings of the  eLAA UL. Thus, when an eNB obtains a  TXOP and transmits on the DL without  consuming the TXOP in entirety, it can  convey this information to UEs through  the Physical Downlink Control Channel  (PDCCH). The UEs will then be able to  transmit on the AUL with just 25\u03bcs LBT   in the configured period.  THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM 5 GHZ  COEXISTENCE SHOULD INFORM THE  DEVELOPMENT OF NEW STANDARDS   FOR 6 GHZ, WHICH IS GREENFIELD FOR   ALL PLAYERS: WI- FI, CELLULAR AND   POTENTIAL NEW ENTRANTS",

LTE-LAA Coexistence Features: 3GPP Vs \t S/W Implementation Vs Carrier Deployment  FeLAA: UE to eNB TXOP Sharing [18]  As discussed earlier, the TXOP sharing  mechanism was designed to aid LAA  UL transmissions. When the modified  regulations allowed it, it presented an  opportunity for reverse TXOP sharing  (from the UE to the eNB). This led several  industry players to propose to 3GPP that  if a TXOP obtained by a UE for AUL  transmission is not fully exhausted, the UE  should be permitted to share it with the  eNB. The eNB then can use it to transmit  control information or data to any UE   with a pause and just 25 \u03bcs LBT.  DEPLOYMENT STUDIES OF   LTE-LAA/WI-FI COEXISTENCE   IN 5 GHZ  LTE-LAA as standardized by 3GPP  developed a suite of features to enable  coexistence with Wi-Fi while improving  throughput of the cellular link. Most of  these features have not been fully tested in  the field before deployment. As LTE-LAA   deployments are being rolled out in major  cities in the US, they offer an opportunity  for real world testing. In this section we  first describe the main 3GPP coexistence  features and then present some preliminary  results on ongoing field testing of LTE-LAA  deployments in the Chicago area.  A. 3GPP Coexistence Features  Table I describes the LAA coexistence  features as proposed by 3GPP, the features  implemented in the system simulation  software ns-3 and those actually being  deployed by carriers currently.   Multi Carrier LBT (3GPP TS 36[dot]213):  Multi-carrier aggregation is still pivotal  to enhancing network capacity in the  unlicensed spectrum. Therefore, LBT of  LAA offers inbuilt support to multi-carrier  operations through two options viz,  Type A and Type B. LBT Type A offers an  independent LBT (back-off) process to  each individual unlicensed carrier while   Type B runs only a single back-off process  for a primary unlicensed carrier similar to  the wide-band operation in Wi-Fi. Thus,  LBT Type A ascertains the access timing  of individual carriers separately depending  on their specific channel conditions. In  contrast, LBT Type B determines a common  access timing for all carriers solely based  on the condition of the primary carrier. It is  therefore evident that LBT Type A is better  suited to leverage multiple carriers and  support carrier aggregation than Type B [19].  Transmission Mode (3GPP TR 36[dot]889):  Different kinds of transmission mode have  been proposed by 3GPP for coexistence  deployment: (a) DL only LAA coexisting  with DL only Wi-Fi, (b) DL only LAA  coexisting with DL + UL Wi-Fi, (c) DL +  UL LAA coexisting with DL + UL Wi-Fi.  Carrier Aggregation (3GPP TR 36[dot]889):  LTE-LAA uses carrier aggregation in the  DL to combine LTE in unlicensed spectrum  (that is at 5 GHz for now) with LTE in licensed  bands. The additional capacity provides  faster data rates and improves the quality   of experience for the end-user.   Antenna Configuration and Modulation  Scheme: LTE- LAA offers 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO  antenna configuration support and the  maximum modulation coding scheme of  256 QAM.  B. 3GPP 5GHz Coexistence Deploy-  ment Scenarios (TR 36[dot]889 V13)  LAA considers deployment scenarios with:  a) macro coverage and without it, b) outdoor  and indoor small cells, c) co-location and   FIGURE 1.

Depending upon the number of macro    licensed carriers (F1), small-cell licensed  carriers (F2) and unlicensed carriers (F3),  four LAA deployment scenarios are possible.   \u2022\u00a0\t Scenario 1: Carrier aggregation between  licensed macro cell (F1) and unlicensed  small cell (F3).  \u2022\u00a0\t Scenario 2: Carrier aggregation between  licensed small cell (F2) and unlicensed  small cell (F3) without macro cell  coverage.  \u2022\u00a0\t Scenario 3: Licensed macro cell and  small cell (F1), with carrier aggregation  between licensed small cell (F1) and  unlicensed small cell (F3).  \u2022\u00a0\t Scenario 4: Aggregation between  licensed macro cell (F1), licensed small  cell (F2), and unlicensed small cell (F3).   If an ideal backhaul exists between the  macro cell and all of small cells, then there is  a possibility of carrier aggregation between  these cells. Otherwise the licensed small  cell and the unlicensed small cell must   be connected in its own small cell cluster  using an ideal backhaul. In addition, dual  connectivity can be established between the  macro cell and the small cell, if it is enabled.  C. Real-time Coexistence  Deployments and Scenarios in   5 GHz as observed in Chicago  LTE-LAA deployments have begun in the  US by the four major operators viz, AT&T,  Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile in the following  regions [20, 21] Chicago, Los Angeles,   San Francisco, Indianapolis, Austin, Dallas,  Houston, San Antonio, California, Florida,  Alabama, Boston, etc LAA capable mobile  devices currently available are Samsung  Galaxy S9, Samsung Galaxy S9+, Samsung  Galaxy S10, Samsung Galaxy S10+, Samsung  Galaxy S10e, Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, Apple  10S, Apple 10S max, Google Pixel 3, Google  Pixel 4, LG G8 ThinQ, LG G8X ThinQ,  OnePlus 7T, 7 Pro, etc We have just begun performing a careful   measurement campaign of the LAA deploy-  ments by cellular operators, such as AT&T,  Verizon, and T-Mobile in downtown   Chicago and several residential areas as  shown in Fig. 2. AT&T sites are marked in  red, Verizon in blue, while the sites labeled  in green are operated by T-Mobile. These  measurements are being made using a  Google Pixel 3 phone running the Network  Signal Guru application [22] that enables  measurement of key cellular metrics, such  as signal strength, transmission parameters,  channels used, etc In this sub-section we  present some preliminary observations from  these measurements. The LTE-LAA/Wi-Fi coexistence scenarios  observed in Chicago are:   \u2022 \t Coexistence of Operator A (T-Mobile)  and Operator B (Verizon) LAA with   Wi-Fi in 5 GHz.  \u2022 \t Coexistence of one Operator (T-Mobile/ Verizon) LAA with Wi-Fi in 5 GHz.   The radio predominantly used in LAA  deployments was the Ericsson\u2019s micro Radio  2205 [23] which operates in the unlicensed  5 GHz band. The deployments in Chicago  were generally observed to be outdoor or  semi-outdoor, in spots such as street lamps,  and operate on LAA channels, which are  equivalent to Wi-Fi channels 36, 40, 44,  149, 153, 157, 161, 165 of the 5 GHz band.  A plausible reason for outdoor deployments  is that the LAA PHY/MAC derives several  features from legacy LTE such as a long   (71 \u03bcs) symbol duration and a limited  number of starting/ending positions in a   subframe. Such features reduce its suitability  for indoor hotspot deployments. However,  outdoor deployments may pose greater  coexistence challenges than indoor deploy-  ments. If both Wi-Fi and LAA are deployed  outdoors, the adverse effect of interference  will be perceived fully, compared to indoor  environments where walls and other  obstructions may reduce interference.   Observations: The deployed LAA networks  we observed have the capability of 2 \u00d7 2  MIMO transmissions with the maximum  modulation coding scheme of 256 QAM.   All three operators make use of a maximum  of 3 unlicensed 20 MHz channels aggregated  with a 20 MHz licensed carrier. We observe   the performance metrics of LAA in terms  of transfer speed for a 10 GB file (using the  configuration listed in Table 2). The average  download speed observed in T-Mobile,   [STANDARDS]  FIGURE 2. Chicago Downtown (Jan. 2020): LTE LAA Deployment by Verizon, T-Mobile   and AT&T operators.  AT&T  Verison  T-Mobile",

Similarly, the maximum  download speed observed in T-Mobile, AT&T,  and Verizon networks is 505, 302, and 210  Mbps, respectively. These metrics are captured  in different regions (and with different load)  in downtown and other residential areas of  Chicago. The number of deployed Wi-Fi APs  and the number of clients associated varied  from one location to another. The Verizon  and AT&T average and maximum data rates  were observed in the downtown Chicago  area where there are dense deployments of  both Wi-Fi APs and LAA cells: hence the  observed throughputs were lower than that of  T-Mobile since the T-Mobile data rates were  recorded in the residential area near the  Guaranteed Rate Field stadium in Chicago  and during the measurement campaign there  were no games being played in the stadium  and hence no Wi-Fi APs were active in  the T-Mobile LAA channels. We continue  to make more measurements to observe  how these throughput numbers change as  deployments of both Wi-Fi and LAA evolve. We also observe that whether the  secondary unlicensed component carriers  get enabled or not depends upon the nature  of the traffic (for example data, video, live streaming,  etc) and the availability of the small cell  (Femto/LAA) coverage. For example, we  observe that the operator does not enable  the LAA unlicensed carrier for real-time  live video traffic to ensure quality of service  (QoS) to the connected users. Further, we observe that the channel  selection in LAA is almost static. This is in  contrast to Wi-Fi channel selection which  varies dynamically based on load and  interference. Through several experiments  we observed that there is very little LAA  usage today in downtown Chicago, possibly  because only a few phones today are LAA- capable and these tend to be more expensive.  In many cases, ours was the only LAA phone  in the cell, since all available resource blocks  were allocated to our device (as reported by  the Network Signal Guru app). This allowed  us to perform a controlled experiment as  follows. First, we turn LAA ON (that is the  Google Pixel 3 phone is connected to the  unlicensed component carrier of LAA) and  requested full-buffer transmission. In this  case, we observe fewer number of Wi-Fi APs  on the same channel. Next, we observe a Wi- Fi/Wi-Fi coexistence scenario without LAA   (that is no LAA unlicensed component carrier  is turned ON), and requested the same  full-buffer transmission using Wi-Fi. In this  case, we observe a larger number of Wi-Fi  APs coexisting on the same channel. From  this, we conclude that the static channel  allocation of LAA accommodates fewer  Wi-Fi APs compared to the Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi  coexistence scenario. Hence, the current  deployment may pose a serious problem  with respect to the static channel selection  on LAA. As LAA resource allocation in  a static channel increased, it adversely  impacts coexisting Wi-Fi transmissions.  In most initial releases, LAA overlooked  several critical points due to inadequate  time, and limited knowledge and experience  on the issues of coexistence in real-world  scenarios as described above [24]. Such  lessons learned from the 5 GHz coexistence  are vital for fair and efficient coexistence  deployments in 6 GHz and all future  bands. We continue our measurement and  experimentation campaign in Chicago to  expand our understanding of coexistence   in the real world.  6 GHZ BAND PROPOSED AND  ADOPTED RULES  On Oct. 23, 2018, the FCC issued a NPRM  with proposed rules for unlicensed systems  to coexist with existing incumbents in the   6 GHz band (5925-7125 MHz) band [1, 25],  followed by a Report and Order that was  adopted on April 23, 2020 [26]. Similarly,  the European Commission also plans to  open 500 MHz in the 6 GHz band (5925- 6725 MHz) for unlicensed access [27].  Hence it is clear that regulatory authorities  worldwide are paying close attention to the  6 GHz band as the next spectrum band that  will continue to enhance unlicensed services  across the world. However, it is also clear that  this band, like the 5 GHz band, will see both  Wi-Fi and cellular systems being deployed,  and hence the coexistence issues played out  in the 5 GHz band will repeat in this new  frequency as well. In recognition of this, the  two principal stakeholder standardization  entities, IEEE and 3GPP, held a coexistence  workshop in July 2019 [28] to discuss  methods to address this prior to the next  generation of standards being specified. In  this section, we discuss the recent activities  on FCC\u2019s 6 GHz NPRM and IEEE & 3GPP  efforts towards coexistence in the 6 GHz band.  A. FCC 6 GHz NPRM  The FCC NPRM proposes to partition the  6 GHz band as shown in Fig. 3 into four  new Unlicensed National Information  Infrastructure (U-NII) bands with the  following preliminary rules:  1) Proposed 4 U-NII bands: FCC NPRM  [1] summarizes the proposed U-NII band  rules for the 6 GHz band. Access points  (APs) using standard power (1 W) can  use 850 MHz bandwidth on U-NII-5 and  U-NII-7 and low-power (250 mW) APs can  use 350 MHz bandwidth on U-NII-6 and  U-NII-8. There will be no operation of APs  in moving vehicles such as cars, aircraft,  UAVs (no clients either).   2) Proposed transmission powers: (a) U-NII-5   and U-NII- 7 Standard-Power Access Points:  The maximum conducted output power is   1 watt and maximum power spectral density  is 17 dBm in any 1 megahertz band. (b)  U-NII-6 and U-NII- 8 band Low-Power  Access Points: The maximum conducted  output power is 250 milliwatts and maximum  power spectral density is 11 dBm in any  1 megahertz band. (c) Client Devices: The  maximum conducted output power is 63  milliwatts and maximum power spectral  density is 5 dBm in any 1 megahertz band.  For all the three cases, if a transmitting  antenna with directional gain greater than   6 dBi is used, the maximum power and  power spectral density shall be reduced   by the amount in dBi that the directional  gain is greater than 6 dBi.

B. Comments on the FCC NPRM  The open comment period for the FCC  NPRM produced a large number of responses  from the three primary stakeholder communi- ties: the incumbents, cellular operators and  Wi-Fi proponents, with each proposing rule  changes to protect their interests. In this sec- tion, we provide a short summary of some of  the key points put forth by each community.  1) Comments from Incumbent Users: The  incumbents urged the FCC to safeguard the  incumbent 6 GHz licensed services by the  creation of a reliable AFC database with the  information of AP ID, position location, and  power level, which is updated daily and can  authenticate devices prior to activation [29].  They also propose that the AFC systems  require interference protection analyses  from transmissions on the neighboring  and second-adjacent channels as well as  co-channel interference in order to prevent  interference from unlicensed devices. The  National Public Safety Telecommunications  Council (NPSTC) [30] recommends that   3) Indoor Vs. Outdoor categories: The  U-NII-5 and U- NII-7 APs need to consult  a frequency database using automated  frequency control (AFC) mechanism  that protects the incumbent services in  this spectrum from harmful interference.  U-NII-6 and U-NII-8 operation is limited  to indoor operation with low power access  points which do not need access to a  frequency database prior to transmission.   4) Existing Incumbents: The U-NII-5 and  U-NII-7 sub-bands are predominantly used  by fixed point-to-point microwave links  and by the Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) for  Earth-to-space transmissions. To protect the  microwave links from harmful interference,  the proposed rules would require that the  standard-power access point obtains a list of  frequencies upon which they may transmit  from an AFC system. Similarly, the U-NII-6  and U-NII-8 bands are used for mobile  stations in the Broadcast Auxiliary Service  and the Cable Television Relay Service as  well as fixed point-to-point microwave links.  The above rules intend to protect  the fixed incumbents via a database and  mobile incumbent users via low power  and indoor operation only. However, there  are still many open issues that need to be  addressed such as determination of available  frequencies, device registration, security   both outdoor and indoor access points be  required to connect to the AFC system since  indoor APs could still interfere with licensed  6 GHz facilities, especially if the AP/client  devices are on the high floor of a multi- storey building. The NPSTC recommends  the Commission implements trial testing  requirements to demonstrate that the AFC,  and representative sample APs and client  devices operate correctly according to the  protocols and algorithms adopted. Such  testing should include trial operations in a  variety of environments, including urban,  suburban and rural. Regular deployment of  6 GHz APs and client devices should await  affirmative results of such testing.   2) Comments from the Cellular Industry:  The success of LTE-LAA demonstrates the  advantages of a technology-neutral approach  in 5 GHz spectrum band. LAA is driving  better in indoor/outdoor mobility, a reduction  in call drops, and the enhancement of existing  WiFi APs. Verizon recommends [31] the  Commission builds on these successes and  extends technology-neutral principles to  unlicensed deployments in the 6 GHz band,  ensuring continued innovation and enabling  new and transformative technologies to  emerge. While cellular operators desire to  deploy 5G in the unlicensed bands, they  also urged the FCC to facilitate greater  mid-band spectrum availability for licensed  cellular use as well, to encourage innovation,  which in turn will attract the investment  required for the proliferation of 5G and next  generation wireless technologies.  3) Comments from the Wi-Fi Industry:  The tremendous growth in the proliferation  of Wi-Fi devices indoors continues to pose a  challenge. The Wi-Fi industry would like the  FCC to allow low-power usage in the U-NII  5 and U-NII 7 bands as well without the use  of AFC, but restricted to indoor usage, with  the claim that low-power combined with  indoor usage will be sufficient to protect  the incumbents in those bands too without  the use of AFC. They claim that allocating  only two, smaller sub-bands for Wi-Fi  indoor operation without the use of AFC  will not suffice to meet the bandwidth or  channel size required to satisfy end-user  data demand. Several reasons have been  cited by Wi-Fi Alliance [32] to ensure  that the low power transmissions will not   FIGURE 3. Bandwidth Allocation on 6 GHz Spectrum.

The above interests and viewpoints from  the various parties need further research and  study to ensure that indeed the proposed  changes will lead to fair coexistence and  adequate protection of incumbents in an  efficient and cost-effective manner. The  implementation of databases for incumbent  protection is usually a long drawn out process,  for example in the TV White Spaces and 3[dot]5 GHz  proceedings, and hence it is understandable  that the Wi-Fi industry would be against it:  however more research is needed to ensure  that doing so will not expose the incumbents  to harmful interference.  C. Report and Order (R&O) and  Further Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking (FNPRM) The FCC adopted a R&O and FNPRM on   April 23, 2020 [26], taking into account the  comments submitted into the record by all  parties. The rules are summarized in Table 3.  There were three major changes: (i) the rules  will allow indoor, low-power access across  the entire 1[dot]2 GHz band (ii) while the allowed  EIRP will remain at 30 dBm, the power spec- tral density (PSD) maximum has been reduced  to 5 dBm/MHz, with the maximum 30 dBm  being permitted across 320 MHz bandwidth  and (iii) unlicensed devices will be required  to implement a contention based protocol  (similar to CSMA/CA used by Wi-Fi) that will  limit the duty cycle used by unlicensed devices. Since 6 GHz unlicensed devices (not access  points) could be outdoors, the rules specified   6 dBm lower power for devices. Another  change from the proposed rules is that instead  of specifying a conducted power and antenna  gain separately, the rules specify total Effective  Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP): this allows  device manufacturers greater flexibility. The  rules as adopted create operational scenarios  that are markedly different from existing   5 GHz rules, which allowed for the maximum  30 dBm of transmitted power over 20 MHz  bandwidth. 6 GHz unlicensed access points,  on the other hand, will only be permitted 18  dBm, 21 dBm, 24 dBm, 27 dBm, and 30 dBm   respectively over 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz,   160n MHz and 320 MHz bandwidths respec-  tively, with unlicensed devices permitted   6 dBm lower EIRPs. The rules for standard-power outdoor  access points remained essentially unchanged:  these will require the use of an AFC, and  devices will also be allowed 6 dBm lower  power than access points. The FNPRM posed two additional ques- tions that will be considered: (i) should the  PSD for low-power indoor devices be raised  to 8 dBm/MHz and (ii) what is an appropri- ate power level for very lower devices to use  outdoors, without an AFC, without causing  interference to incumbents. The former  will allow wider coverage per access point  and the latter will enable high-bandwidth  portable devices like AR/VR glasses.   6 GHZ COEXISTENCE:  DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS   AND CHANNEL ACCESS  Although several industry entities were not  in favor of a reevaluation, IEEE recommend- ed that coexistence evaluations for NR-U  should include 802[dot]11ac (in 5 GHz), 802[dot]11ax    (in 6 GHz), and 802[dot]11ad (in 60 GHz).   For the sub-7 GHz bands, coexistence  evaluations will be technology neutral   (for example channel access mechanism) and will  be performed in random carrier frequen- cies in the 5 GHz band. These evaluations  also necessitate devising suitable 11ac/ax   coexistence topologies with significant  number of links below -72 dBm.   A. NR-U: Deployment Scenarios  Table 4 shows the standardization updates  on 5 and 6 GHz spectrum band. The NR-U  work item recently approved by 3GPP  supports not only the existing unlicensed  5 GHz band but also the new unlicensed  \u201dgreenfield\u201d 6 GHz band. Industry players  such as Qualcomm expect that in future re- leases other unlicensed and shared spectrum  bands including mmWave will be added to  this list. To investigate the functionalities  needed beyond the specifications for opera- tion in unlicensed spectrum, the following  deployment scenarios will be studied [18].  \u2022\u00a0\t Carrier aggregation between licensed  band NR (PCell) and NR-U (SCell):   (a) NR-U SCell with both DL and UL.

NR-U is  likely to be a more potent competitor to  802[dot]11 than LAA as it will have a more  flexible and efficient PHY/MAC marked by  a shorter symbol duration, shorter HARQ  Round Trip Time (RTT), etc Further, NR-U  can be deployed in every configuration  where 802[dot]11 is currently operational if  both, standalone and dual connection, are  approved. In addition, unlike 802[dot]11, NR-U  will be capable of deploying the same PHY/ MAC with flexible configurations across all  current and future unlicensed bands.  B. Narrowband versus Wideband LBT in 6 GHz  The LBT mechanism is used by a device to  avoid collisions by ensuring that no other  transmissions are concurrently active in the  channel. LTE-LAA follows CAT 4 LBT for  most of its transmissions, while CAT 2 LBT  is used for about 5% of DL transmissions  [33]. NR-U is likely to adopt a mechanism  similar to the LAA LBT. NR-U Release 16,   like its predecessor, the NR Release 15,  supports component carrier up to the  maximum limit of 100 MHz bandwidth. In  addition, it supports aggregation of several  inter and intra band component carriers  [34]. Multi-carrier LBT channel access as  defined in 5 GHz is assumed, that is the Type A    LBT in 3GPP TS37[dot]213, where each  channel performs its own independent LBT  procedure. Consequently, there is bound  to be high complexity when the operation  bandwidth is wide. The alternative Type  B LBT in 3GPP TS37[dot]213 can reduce this  complexity by performing single LBT on  multiple channels. The wideband LBT could  simplify the implementation of wideband  operation when it can be guaranteed that the  channel is free of narrow band interference,  that is limiting usage of narrow band signal    (20 MHz) on certain sub-bands or by  long/short term measurements and LBT  bandwidth adaption. Hence, wideband  LBT is beneficial for systems operating  with wide bandwidth as it simplifies LBT  implementation.  NS-3 IMPLEMENTATION OF   WI-FI AND LAA COEXISTENCE  In order to evaluate the performance of  current and future Wi-Fi and cellular  coexistence in realistic environments,  academic and industry researchers are using  a combination of analysis, simulation and  real-world experimentation. Each of these  methods are important in arriving at a  complete understanding of the complicated  coexistence scenarios enabled by the new  technologies under development. One  particularly important effort on the software  simulation aspect is the implementation  of coexistence scenarios in a widely used  network simulator frame-work, ns-3.  ns-3 consists of a wide range of simulation  modules which includes wired and wireless  networks, including Wi-Fi and LTE modules.  At present, ns-3 has only implemented Wi- Fi up to 802[dot]11ac and licensed spectrum  LTE, while the work on 802[dot]11ax and NR  is currently still in progress. Therefore,  this section will focus only on the 5 GHz  coexistence framework that has been released.  In ns-3, modules are implemented  independently of each other, therefore both  Wi-Fi and LAA implementations are different  even though they are contained within the  same simulation framework. Hence, the  \u201cLAA-WiFi-Coexistence\u201d module is designed  to serve as a framework that unifies Wi-Fi  and LAA implementations under ns-3  [35]. The LAA implementation is based on  Release 13 and contains all of the indoor  and outdoor scenarios defined in the 3GPP  TR36[dot]889 [7]. It modified the Wi-Fi and   LTE modules to enable coexistence. For  Wi-Fi, a spectrum channel model similar to  LTE model is implemented, thus enabling  the Wi-Fi module to sense the channel  spectrum in response to LAA transmissions.  The LTE module is also modified to handle  LBT and TXOP procedures. An AdHoc Wi- Fi component is created in monitor mode  (only to sense the channel) and tied to the  LAA\u2019s procedure. This enables the reuse of  Wi-Fi\u2019s CSMA procedure to enable LBT   and to sense Wi-Fi transmissions. Currently, the LAA implementation  in ns-3 only supports non-standalone  procedures. This implies that LAA is only  deployed in downlink, while the uplink  transmissions are done over the licensed  spectrum. Further, it can be configured to  a maximum of 4\u00d74 MIMO and 256-QAM  modulation. The current LAA simulation is  also limited to one Wi-Fi channel (channel 36)   with 20 MHz bandwidth. In the future, we  intend to increase the number of channels  that can be deployed. The full implementation  of Release 16 is also planned, which will  include interoperability between 802[dot]11ax and  NR-U specifications. The implementation of  common preamble is also being considered.   INDUSTRY PROPOSED   SOLUTIONS FOR 6 GHZ  COEXISTENCE  Several ideas to improve coexistence in 6 GHz  were put forth by several industry and some  academic participants at the Coexistence  Workshop in July 2019 [28]. In this section,  we present the two that appeared to have  the most consensus viz, a common Energy  Detect (ED) threshold and common  preamble with preamble detection (PD),   as shown in Fig. 4. Although these have not  yet been standardized by 3GPP or IEEE,  they provide the best path forward for  improving coexistence in 6 GHz.  3GPP Releases \t LAA Wi-Fi Coexistence on 5 GHz Band \t NR-U Wi-Fi Coexistence on 6 GHz Band  \t DL \t UL \t Autonomous UL \t LBT \t CA \t Indoor \t Outdoor \t DL \t UL \t LBT \t CA \t Indoor \t Outdoor  Release 13\t \u2713\t x\t x\t \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  -\t -\t -\t -\t -\t -\t  Release 14\t \u2713  \u2713  x  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  -\t -\t -\t -\t -\t -  Release 15\t \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  -\t \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713 Release 16\t -\t -\t -\t -\t \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  \u2713  TABLE 4. 3GPP Standardization Updates on 5 GHz and 6 GHz Spectrum Band",

The les- sons learned from 5 GHz coexistence should  inform the development of new standards for  6 GHz, which is greenfield for all players:  Wi-Fi, cellular and potential new entrants.  There is an opportunity to reevaluate and  design all specifications to naturally coexist  with any dissimilar system that may coexist  in the same spectrum, for it is clear, as evi- denced by recent FCC actions, that future  spectrum allocations will more heavily lean  towards spectrum sharing and coexistence  rather than dedicated licensed spectrum.  However, this will require cooperation  between standardization groups, informed  by the investigations and results from the  broader research community, to develop  coexistence methodologies (of which the  common preamble is an example) that will  truly address the coexistence problem from  the ground up rather than after the fact. n  Vanlin Sathya received his PhD in computer  science and engineering from IIT Hyderabad,  India, in 2016.

He is  currently a PhD student in computer science   at the University of Chicago, USA, where he   is studying the coexistence fairness between  LTE and Wi-Fi in terms of throughput and  spectrum access, both in real-time test-bed   and simulation framework.  A. Common Detection   Mechanism and Thresholds  Past work by various researchers [9, 36]  has amply demonstrated that the inherent  asymmetry in the ED thresholds used by  LTE-LAA and Wi-Fi is one of the root  causes for poor coexistence between LTE  and Wi-Fi in 5 GHz. Since Wi-Fi was already  widely deployed in 5 GHz, it would have  been difficult, if not impossible, to modify  thresholds of the installed base of Wi-Fi  APs and devices. However, since no such  installed base exists in 6 GHz, revaluation of  the protection thresholds used by NR-U and  Wi-Fi 6 should be the preferred approach.  The optimum ED threshold is one that not  only maximizes throughput of each system  individually, but also improves coexistence  performance. Ongoing research on the best  common threshold, - 62 dBm, - 72 dBm or -  82 dBm, will inform the standards bodies on  the best way forward. Too low a threshold  will lead to false \u201cbusy\u201d detects and too high  will exacerbate hidden node problems. From  an implementation point of view a common  ED threshold is simpler to enforce than  other coexistence methods and can benefit  both 802[dot]11ax and NR-U, by facilitating  additional spatial reuse gain [18].  B. Common Preamble Solution  While relying on energy detection for  protection is easy to implement and does  not require either system to \u201crecognize\u201d the  other, it also has problems, the most serious  being inefficient medium usage due to false  detects, especially if the ED threshold is too   low (for example - 82dBm). One solution, that does  not involve explicit common preambles,  is to use existing features in Wi-Fi (for example known training sequences in the preamble)  and LTE/NR (e.g synchronization channels,  OFDM symbol length) to reliably detect  each other using correlation [37] and/or  learning techniques [38]. However, these  methods may not work reliably in all chan- nel conditions and at low SNR. A common  preamble as proposed in [39] that is used  at the start of all transmissions from either  system will enable robust coexistence by  enabling each system to detect the presence  of the other, reliably, at a low threshold of  -82 dBm. In essence, this is how Wi-Fi coex- ists with itself and this approach has been  proven to be successful. Expanding the fun- damental idea to coexistence of dissimilar  systems should be the preferred methodol- ogy, especially in 6 GHz, which is greenfield  for both NR-U and Wi-Fi 6. While this  basic idea has acceptance from both IEEE  and 3GPP, it remains to be seen whether  the details and a design that is acceptable  to both parties can be standardized. A well- designed common preamble can also enable  coexistence in scenarios where one or more  systems is using directional transmissions  and/or different bandwidths: an open prob- lem even for 5 GHz. Furthermore, a long  term benefit of a common preamble is that  future systems, beyond IEEE and 3GPP,  that wish to use the unlicensed 6 GHz   spectrum may adopt the same preamble  thus leading to improved spectral use for   all coexisting systems, present and future.
