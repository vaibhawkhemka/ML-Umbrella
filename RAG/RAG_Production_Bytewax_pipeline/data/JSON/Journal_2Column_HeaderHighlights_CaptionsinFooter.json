Here, we developed in situ electro-sequencing (electro-seq) that combines \ufb02exible bioelectronics with in situ RNA sequencing to stably map millisecond-timescale elec- trical activity and pro\ufb01le single-cell gene expression from the same cells across intact biological networks, including cardiac and neural patches. When applied to human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardi- omyocyte patches, in situ electro-seq enabled multimodal in situ analysis of cardiomyocyte electrophysi- ology and gene expression at the cellular level, jointly de\ufb01ning cell states and developmental trajectories. Using machine-learning-based cross-modal analysis, in situ electro-seq identi\ufb01ed gene-to-electrophysi- ology relationships throughout cardiomyocyte development and accurately reconstructed the evolution of gene expression pro\ufb01les based on long-term stable electrical measurements. In situ electro-seq could be applicable to create spatiotemporal multimodal maps in electrogenic tissues, potentiating the discovery of cell types and gene programs responsible for electrophysiological function and dysfunction.  INTRODUCTION  Paired charting of single-cell gene expression and electrophysi- ology in intact cells and tissues across time and space is crucial to understanding gene-to-function relationships in \ufb01elds ranging from developmental biology to cardiology and neuroscience.1\u20135  Such multimodal methods require stable and continuous recording of individual cell electrical activity with high spatio- temporal resolution across three-dimensional (3D) biological samples, multiplexed pro\ufb01ling of a large number of genes in elec- trically recorded cells, and multimodal and cross-modal compu- tational analysis. Large-scale single-cell electrical recording6\u20138 and high- throughput single-cell sequencing9\u201311 have enabled system- level investigation of single-cell electrophysiology and gene expression, respectively. However, existing multimodal methods either lack high spatiotemporal resolution or cannot chronically stably measure electrical activities across 3D biolog- ical samples. For example, combining calcium imaging with RNA hybridization12 reveals the correlation between calcium activity and molecularly de\ufb01ned cell types but only permits the recording  of cell activity on the scale of seconds and pro\ufb01ling of a limited number of genes. On the other hand, patch-sequencing (patch-seq) method1,3 quanti\ufb01es cell activity with millisecond resolution and pro\ufb01les the transcriptomes of recorded cells, but it assays cells one at a time and requires membrane disrup- tion for electrical measurement, precluding 3D multiplexed and long-term stable electrical activity mapping. Recent progress in thin-\ufb01lm \ufb02exible bioelectronics has enabled the development of \ufb02exible and stretchable \u2018\u2018tissue- like\u2019\u2019 electronics capable of seamlessly integrating with tissue networks for long-term, stable, millisecond-timescale, single- cell electrical mapping.13\u201317 Meanwhile, current imaging-based in situ sequencing methods18 can achieve end-point spatial analysis of thousands of genes at subcellular resolution across intact biological samples. Here, we combine \ufb02exible and stretch- able tissue-like bioelectronics with in situ sequencing in a method termed \u2018\u2018in situ electro-sequencing (electro-seq)\u2019\u2019 that enables scalable and paired pro\ufb01ling of single-cell gene expres- sion and electrophysiology in intact biological networks, including human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiac patches and cultured mouse neural patches.  ll  2002 Cell 186, 2002\u20132017, April 27, 2023 \u00aa 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

      "text": "RESULTS  In situ electro-seq platform We applied stretchable sub-micrometer-thick mesh electronics with cellular size electrodes to seamlessly integrate with cardiac and neural patches for continuous electrical recording and to pre- vent potential cell-to-electrode dislocation during cell culture, sample preparation, and multiple cycles of in situ sequencing (Fig- ure 1A). Then, we embedded the sample into a hydrogel to form a cell-electronics-hydrogel network that is compatible with the in situ sequencing protocol and capable of co-deformation during volume change. To precisely identify the electrically recorded cells in 3D cell networks, we used photolithography to pattern the thin- \ufb01lm microscale polymeric structures with distinct \ufb02uorescent electronic barcodes (E-barcodes), which were paired with each individual electrode to label its recording channel during \ufb02uores- cence imaging cycles of in situ sequencing. The E-barcodes served to trace each electrode and identify the electrically re- corded cells with precise 3D coordinates, allowing for the integra- tion of electrical recording with gene expression. Brie\ufb02y, in situ electro-seq consists of four key steps (Fig- ure 1A): (1) the mesh electronics with E-barcoded electrodes are embedded in the biological samples, such as cardiac and neural patches for continuous electrical recording; (2) the entire cell-electronics hybrid is \ufb01xed, embedded in hydrogels, and cleared for in situ sequencing; (3) gene identities and E-barcodes are simultaneously read out by multiple cycles of \ufb02uorescence imaging to integrate electrical recording with gene expression pro\ufb01ling at single-cell resolution; and (4) the in- tegrated data are analyzed using multimodal and cross-modal visualization and correlation to reconstruct spatiotemporal gene-to-function relationships.  In situ electro-seq integrates single-cell transcriptional and electrophysiological states of hiPSC-derived cardiac patches We applied in situ electro-seq to hiPSC-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) patches to map electrophysiology and gene expres- sion from the same cells. First, our representative mesh elec- tronics had 64 electrodes, each 25 mm in diameter (Figures 1B and S1), and were designed, based on recent reports,6,7,19\u201322  to record localized, single-cell-level electrophysiology19,21 with low noise level (root mean square voltage < 10 mV) and reliable single-unit separation (amplitude > 60 mV). A pair of center-sym- metric \ufb02uorescent E-barcodes with distinct binary codes was patterned with each electrode at the center (Figures 1C, S1F, and S1G). Characterizing electrode impedance (Figure 1D) showed stable performance across different samples (Figure 1E)  and over 2 months in the physiological solution (Figure 1F) for long-term electrical recording. Then, hiPSC-CMs were generated and integrated with mesh electronics to form a cardiac patch, as described previously.14,17  We used immunostaining and calcium imaging to characterize the quality of hiPSC-CMs (Figures S2A and S2B). The immuno- staining results showed that approximately 95% of the cells were CMs marked by troponin T (TNT), a-actinin, myosin heavy chain 6 (MYH6), and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleo- tide-gated cation channel 4 (HCN4), demonstrating that our pro- tocol generated hiPSC-CMs with high purity and little batch-to- batch variation (Figures S2C and S2D). The calcium imaging results further showed that the calcium waveform kept evolving from day 12 to 21 and stabilized from day 21 to 64 (Figures S2E\u2013S2I), consistent with previous \ufb01ndings.23 After co-culturing hiPSC-CMs with mesh electronics, we immuno- stained TNT and a-actinin on hiPSC-CM patch-electronics hy- brids. Results demonstrated that the integrated mesh elec- tronics had negligible effects on hiPSC-CM development (Figures S2J\u2013S2R). Finally, we \ufb01xed hiPSC-CM patch-elec- tronics hybrids and applied the in situ sequencing protocol (see STAR Methods) to spatially pro\ufb01le a targeted set of cardiac genes, including the 201 most differentially expressed genes during cardiac development, extracted from the previous sin- gle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.24\u201327 Speci\ufb01cally, RNA-derived DNA amplicons with pre-designed gene-speci\ufb01c identi\ufb01ers were synthesized in situ by probe hybridization, enzy- matic ampli\ufb01cation, and immobilization in the cleared hiPSC-CM patch-electronics-hydrogel network (Figure 1G), and gene-spe- ci\ufb01c identi\ufb01ers were then decoded through \ufb01ve sequencing cy- cles.18 To evaluate potential cell-to-electrode dislocation during sample preparation and multiple cycles of in situ sequencing, we calculated the change in the distances from cells to electrodes before and after sample preparation to be 0[dot]51 \u00b1 0[dot]43 mm, which is orders of magnitude smaller than the size of one cell, and thus negligible (Figures S3A\u2013S3D). Addition- ally, the microscale distances among E-barcodes, cells, and am- plicons remained unchanged during the multiple cycle imaging (Figure 1H). Next, we tested in situ electro-seq in the hiPSC-CM patches (Figures 2A\u20132D). The electrical recording was performed, and single-spike \ufb01eld potential waveforms were identi\ufb01ed, pre-pro- cessed, averaged, and down-sampled to extract features. Figures 2E and 2F show representative voltage traces and sin- gle-spike waveforms, respectively. The uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)28 visualization (Figure 2F, inset) of extracted features from each channel showed the het- erogeneity of hiPSC-CM electrophysiology. We also used drug  Figure 1. In situ electro-seq platform (A) Schematics summarizing the in situ electro-seq method. (B) Representative photograph of \ufb02exible mesh electronics.

      "text": "tests to con\ufb01rm that the mechanical activities of hiPSC- CMs cause no interruptions on the electrical recording (Figures S3E\u2013S3H). Then, in situ sequencing was applied imme- diately after electrical recording (Figure 2G). After 3D cell seg- mentation (Figures 2H and 2I),29 we performed cell clustering by Leiden clustering.30 The result showed two major cell types (Figure 2J), CMs and cardiac \ufb01broblasts (Fibs), which were spatially mapped back to E-barcoded electrodes (Figure 2K). To determine how to identify the cells recorded by the elec- trodes, we conducted electrical recording and calcium imaging in the same sample (Figures S3I\u2013S3L) and tested the localization of signals recorded from the mesh electronics. The results indi- cated that, among all calcium signal-positive cells, only those that directly contact electrodes can be recorded (Figure S3L). Based on this data, we \ufb01rst built a computational pipeline to automatically identify CMs that directly contact the electrode as electrically recorded cells (Figures 2K, S3M, and S3N). Then, the identi\ufb01cation of E-barcodes registered the electro- physiological features (E features) with gene expression of the electrically recorded cells. The resulting heatmap (Figure 2L) and joint UMAP (Figure 2M) visualizations showed the integrated E features with the differentially expressed CM-related genes and their multimodal distributions, respectively.  In situ electro-seq enables the multimodal spatial mapping of neural patches We applied the in situ electro-seq to neural patches by \ufb01rst inte- grating stretchable mesh electronics with sparsely seeded pri- mary mouse hippocampal neurons (Figure 3A). The electrical re- cordings of single-neuron activity showed high heterogeneity in their temporal \ufb01ring patterns and spike waveforms (Figures 3B, 3C, and S4B). In situ sequencing was performed after electrical recording. After 3D cell segmentation, we performed cell clus- tering by Leiden clustering. The results showed \ufb01ve major cell types (Figures 3F, S4C, and S4D): excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, Fibs, and glial cells, all of which were then spatially mapped back to their locations (Figure 3D). To ensure correct identi\ufb01cation of the electrically recorded neurons, we considered only two scenarios: (1) only one neuron within 60-mm of the corresponding electrode (the sensing area), or (2) the same neural signal simultaneously captured by multiple elec- trodes. Next, we performed spike sorting and identi\ufb01ed the neuron locations using electrode positions and corresponding spike amplitudes, as previously described (Figures 3E and  S4A).31 The sparse distribution of seeded neurons among glial cells enabled robust identi\ufb01cation of the electrically recorded neurons at single-cell resolution. The electrical waveforms were then mapped to the associated electrically recorded neu- rons (Figure 3E). Notably, we observed distinct gene expression patterns between electrically recorded excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with excitatory neurons showing high expression of Slc17a6 and inhibitory neurons showing high expression of Gad1 (Figures 3G, S4C, and S4D). Furthermore, by correlating the cell type with electrical recording, we found that excitatory and inhibitory neurons show a statistically signi\ufb01cant difference in electrical features such as peak-trough ratio (Figures 3G and 3H), which is consistent with the previous reports.32,33 Together, these results demonstrated that the in situ electro-seq platform is capable of correlating cell electrophysiology and gene expres- sion at the single-cell level when applied to cultured neural networks.  In situ electro-seq enabled multimodal joint clustering We used in situ electro-seq to trace the development of hiPSC- CM patches (Figure 4A). The cell electrophysiological signals from days 12, 21, 46, and 64 of differentiation (Figures 4B and 4C) showed distinct features at these four stages. We next applied the ClusterMap29 method to segment cells based on RNA identities. UMAP visualizations of cell types across four dif- ferentiation stages showed equivalent embedding distributions between electronics-contacted and control cells, suggesting the negligible effects of mesh electronics on hiPSC-CM develop- ment and on the performance of in situ sequencing (Figures 4D and 4E). We then performed Leiden clustering analysis on all in situ sequenced samples across 4 stages and identi\ufb01ed 5 cell clusters (Figure 4F). Based on the expression levels of marker genes, four clusters can be characterized as CMs and one as cardiac Fibs. Moreover, based on previous reports,24,34  the changing expression levels of marker genes (for example HCN4, MYH6, MYH7, MYL7, MYL4, etc) in these four types of CMs indi- cated a transition from nodal-like through atrial-like to ventricu- lar-like CMs (Figures 4G and 4H). Notably, the nodal marker gene (HCN4) and atrial marker gene (MYH6) decreased at later stages, while the ventricular maker gene (MYH7) increased (Figures 4I and 4J). While gene expression clustering separates hiPSC-CMs into four transcriptional states (t-states) that roughly correspond to the samples collected at the four differentiation days, we noticed  Figure 2.

      "text": "that CM t-states at days 46 and 64 of differentiation are less separable (Figure 4F). Statistical testing showed that the separa- bility of t-states of electrically recorded hiPSC-CMs was worse (Figures 5A, S5A, and S5B) for days 21, 46, and 64 of dif- ferentiation (Figures S5C and S5D), agreeing with previously re- ported scRNA-seq clustering of hiPSC-CM t-states during development.24 Using E features to cluster the electrically re- corded cells, we identi\ufb01ed two major electrophysiological states (e-states) for hiPSC-CMs, one for days 12 and 21, and the other for days 46 and 64. However, the separability of subgroups within the two major groups was low (Figures 5B and S5E). Pre- vious patch-seq results suggested that integrating gene expres- sion with electrophysiology could improve the classi\ufb01cation of cell types.35 Thus, we used the weight nearest neighbor (WNN)36 algorithm from Seurat v4 to integrate electrophysiolog- ical and gene expression data as joint representation (see STAR Methods). Using the joint features, hiPSC-CMs can be clustered into four joint states (j-states) that well represent the distinct dif- ferentiation days (Figures 5C and S5F). In addition, we applied Monocle337 to calculate pseudotime distributions of t-states, e-states, and j-states. The results also showed that integrating gene expression and electrophysiology data led to a better sep- aration of pseudotime distributions for cells at distinct differenti- ation stages (Figure 5D). The electrically recorded hiPSC-CMs with their j-state pseudotimes were highlighted in the UMAP visualization of hiPSC-CM t-states (Figure 5E) to show that the j-states clearly recapitulated the continuous developmental tra- jectory of hiPSC-CMs (Figures 4E and 4I). Additionally, we inves- tigated the contribution of non-transcriptional factors to electro- physiology, such as spatial information of cells and oscillator coupling between hiPSC-CMs. The results showed that these non-transcriptional factors also correlate with electrophysiology but to a much lower extent in comparison with the transcriptional factor (Figure S5G\u2013S5J). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the in situ electro-seq platform can ef\ufb01ciently characterize the evolution of cell states over the time course of hiPSC-CM development.  In situ electro-seq enabled cross-modal correlation and inference A capability of in situ electro-seq is the development of a model for cross-modal inference, which can be used to (1) infer gene expression at unmeasured time points from continuous electro- physiological measurements and (2) change the expression levels of individual genes or a combination of multiple genes to infer their effects on electrophysiology. To achieve this, we  used sparse reduced-rank regression (RRR) analysis, a statisti- cal model successfully applied to analyze patch-seq data,38 to (1) quantitatively investigate the correlations between individual genes and changes in electrophysiological waveform features during hiPSC-CM differentiation and development, and (2) select a subset of genes that is most relevant to the temporal evolution of these electrophysiological waveform features throughout hiPSC-CM development (Figure 6A). Speci\ufb01cally, we down-sampled the entire spike waveform and extracted data points (Figure 6B) directly from the waveform as input E features. Then, we plugged our paired electrophysiolog- ical and transcriptional measurements into the sparse RRR model, which aligned the electrophysiological and transcrip- tional representations in the low-dimensional space and gener- ated two corresponding biplots (Figure 6C).35,38 This allowed us to directly pinpoint the correlations between certain E features and certain gene transcripts by comparing the angles of pro- jected lines (that is E features and gene transcripts, respectively) between the two biplots.35,38 Next, we used the cosine distance as the metrics to evaluate the correlations between gene tran- scripts and E features in these biplots and generated a gene- to-E feature correlation heatmap (Figures 6D and 6E). We found that different genes correlated with different E features, which were grouped based on the quadrants of the electrophysiolog- ical biplot (Figure 6C). The analysis led to a distilled list of genes, whose temporal dynamics are most correlated with the temporal evolution of E features throughout hiPSC-CM development (Fig- ure 6F). The model-selected genes include: (1) cardiac structural genes, such as myosin heavy chain (MYH6, MYH7), troponin complex (TNNT2), and Z-disc (VCL, VIM); (2) ion-channel-related genes, such as sodium-calcium exchangers (SLC8A1), calcium signaling gene (RYR2), and potassium channels (KCND3); and (3) metabolic genes, such as endoplasmic reticulum calcium transporting genes (ATP2A2) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 8A (COX8A). Next, to enable continuous electrophysiology-to-transcript (E-to-T) and transcript-to-electrophysiology (T-to-E) inferences, we constructed a coupled autoencoder39,40 to learn coordinated representations of the E features and sparse RRR analysis- selected gene transcripts from days 12, 21, 46, and 64 of differ- entiation (Figure 7A). The coupled autoencoder consists of two autoencoder networks, each comprising an encoder and a decoder subnetwork that project the input E features or gene transcripts into a low-dimensional representation and back to the input data space. After learning the paired training data be- tween E features and gene transcripts, the trained coupled  Figure 3.

      "text": "autoencoder was able to successfully project the high-dimen- sional transcriptional (Xt) and electrophysiological (Xe) data to aligned low-dimensional representations (Zt and Ze) (Figure 7B). This suggests that a common latent representation exists be- tween the gene expression and electrophysiology modalities, and that we could potentially infer one modality from the other.39,40 To test this, we applied the pre-trained coupled au- toencoder to a validation dataset and successfully inferred tran- scriptional data from electrophysiological data (Figure 7C). 5-fold cross-validation showed high inference performance of the coupled autoencoder (Figures 7D\u20137F; STAR Methods). These results suggested that electrophysiological data gener- ated by in situ electro-seq can be used to infer the expression of electrophysiology-related gene programs and vice versa.39,40  After con\ufb01rming the performance of the model, we \ufb01rst applied the pre-trained coupled autoencoder to infer temporal gene expression change from the continuous electrical recording of the same sample (Figures 7G, S5M, and S5N). Because the gene expression measurement is an end-point measurement that requires sample \ufb01xation, it is dif\ufb01cult to directly measure tem- poral gene expression pro\ufb01les from the same sample over the time course of development. However, our \ufb02exible electronics can record cell electrical activity from the same sample over a period of months. Then, our coupled autoencoder-based model offers the possibility of inferring a temporal gene expression pro\ufb01le from the long-term electrical recording of the same sample (Fig- ure 7Gi). Speci\ufb01cally, Figures 7Gi\u20137Giii show that the electrical ac- tivity of a hiPSC-CM sample was measured by the embedded electrodes from day 17 to 64 of differentiation. A temporal gene expression pro\ufb01le from day 17 to 64 of differentiation was then in- ferred (Figures 7Giv and 7Gv). To validate the inferred result, we measured the gene expression from the sample after the long- term electrical measurement on the last day of recording\u2014day 64 of differentiation. Comparing the measured gene expression with the inferred gene expression reveals a Pearson\u2019s r of 0[dot]68 \u00b1 0[dot]11 (mean \u00b1 SD) (Figure 7Gv), which can be considered as good results based on previous studies.35,39,41  Finally, we applied the pre-trained coupled autoencoder model to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patient-derived LMNA (lamin A/C protein) mutant cells.42 We used the gene expression changes in LMNA-mutant hiPSC-CMs from previously reported data42 to infer the electrophysiological waveform (Figures 7Hi\u2013 7Hiii). Compared with the electrophysiological waveform from healthy hiPSC-CMs, the inferred LMNA-mutant hiPSC-CM waveform showed distinct E features, including (1) missed sharp up/down stroke, (2) declined depolarization upstroke and repo-  larization downstroke amplitude in phase 0/1, and (3) increased afterdepolarization amplitude in phase 2/3 (Figures 7Hiv). To experimentally validate whether the inferred LMNA-mutant hiPSC-CM electrophysiological waveform can successfully recapitulate the real electrical activity of LMNA-mutant hiPSC- CMs, we cultured the LMNA-mutant hiPSC-CMs on the mesh electronics and recorded their electrical activities. The results showed that the inferred waveform aligned well with the measured waveform (Figure 7Hiv), with a Pearson\u2019s r correlation of 0[dot]63 (Figure 7I). In contrast, the waveform inference results af- ter random shuf\ufb02ing of LMNA-mutant hiPSC-CMs\u2019 gene expres- sion showed a low Pearson\u2019s r correlation of \u00010[dot]14 with the measured LMNA-mutant waveform (Figure 7I). These results provide further indication of the potential value of our model, speci\ufb01cally in the context of cardiac diseases, where the testing samples involve the same cell types to those used in the training samples. We noted that current machine learning or statistical learning models for cross-modal inference were built solely on the training data. Such a model can achieve satisfactory inference results when the testing data has similar characteristics to the training data. For example, in this case, the LMNA-mutant hiPSC-CMs at a later developmental stage showed similar elec- trophysiological waveform characteristics to the training sam- ples (healthy hiPSC-CMs) at early developmental stages, so our pre-trained coupled autoencoder model was still able to infer its electrophysiological waveform. However, we noted that the current machine-learning-based model may not be directly applied to infer electrophysiological waveforms of samples with characteristics substantially different from the training sam- ple distribution. As a result, increasing the training datasets to cover a wider range of time points across longer development periods and more diverse hiPSC-CM samples (including different mutation and disease samples) may potentially improve the applicability of the model, particularly for inferring electro- physiological changes resulting from multiple gene expression changes in cardiac diseases, wherein testing samples involve identical cell types to those in the training data.  DISCUSSION  We demonstrate that in situ electro-seq is capable of integrating electrophysiology and gene expression at single- and multi-cell levels (Figures S6 and S7), providing (1) multimodal joint cell clus- tering for identi\ufb01cation of cell states and trajectories, which cannot be directly traced by previous approaches, (2) cross-modal  Figure 4.

      "text": "acknowledge that neighboring CMs coalesce through gap junc- tions and adhesive junctions to form the myocardium during development43,44 and that hiPSC-CMs show a progressively organized ultrastructure during development.4,43,45 As a result, extracellular electrical recordings could also re\ufb02ect the activities of hiPSC-CM groups surrounding the electrode. We then tested an alternative computational pipeline by identifying all the cells surrounding the electrode for a multi-cell data analysis (Figure S6A). The multi-cell analysis recapitulates the same hiPSC-CM developmental trajectory, cell clustering, and electro- physiology-to-gene correlations (Figures S6 and S7) as the sin- gle-cell analysis, suggesting that single- and multi-cellular-level analysis may lead to consistent results when analyzing hiPSC- CM patches with relatively homogeneous cell composition.43,45  The ability to record the single-cell activity was also tested and supported by primary neuron culture with diverse cell types (Fig- ures 3 and S4), where single-cell resolution is necessary to reg- ister single-neuron electrophysiological activities with molecular cell types and states. Future work may address potential opportunities. For example, integrating different \ufb02exible electronics with intracel- lular electrodes46 and multifunctional sensors and stimulators (for example electrical, mechanical, optical, chemical, etc)47 with in situ sequencing of different biomolecules (for example RNA or DNA) could open up unlimited access to different biological systems. Incorporating STARmap Plus (\u00032,700 genes panels)48 into our current in situ electro-seq platform could also obtain more in- depth genetic information. Further scaling up the multiplexity of electrode arrays and increasing the electrode density in mesh electronics can increase the number and percentage of recorded cells per sample. Furthermore, integrating comple- mentary metal-oxide-semiconductor multiplexing circuits could also substantially increase the number of cells that can be simultaneously measured.49 Mesh nanoelectronics have already been used for the recording of electrical activity in 3D organoids14 and behaving animals.13,15,50 Further development of in situ electro-seq may map single-cell gene expression and functions in organoids and in vivo tissue samples13,15,50  during both healthy and diseased states. For example, tissue- wide electrophysiological dysfunction can be correlated with cell-level gene expression variation in models of neuropsychi- atric diseases51,52 (for example autism spectrum disorder, bipolar dis- orders, etc) and cardiac diseases53 (for example atrial \ufb01brillation, ven- tricular tachycardia, etc).  Limitations of the study It is also noteworthy that, although we have successfully con- ducted cross-modal correlation and inference (Figures 6 and 7), the resulting gene-to-electrophysiology relationship should be interpreted as correlation, not causality. Further genetic perturbation or molecular inhibition experiments are needed to fully establish the causal relationship and underlying mecha-  nisms between genes and their functions. In particular, the elec- trophysiological patterns may lag behind the change of RNA expression pro\ufb01les because extra time is needed for mRNA to be translated to proteins, for proteins to be transported to their functional loci, and for single cells to grow and form biological networks. In our study, we sampled cell electrophysiology every 3 days, whereas the mRNAs typically only last for a few hours in- side cells. Thus, at such a temporal resolution of 3 days, the tem- poral pro\ufb01les of RNA can be reliably correlated with the paired recorded cell electrophysiology. However, for biological systems with fast kinetics at the scale of hours (for example embryonic develop- ment, acute genetic perturbation), the molecular cell states de\ufb01ned by RNA may not re\ufb02ect the functional cell states measured at the same time, and vice versa. Therefore, develop- ments of computational methods and theoretical models with the spatiotemporal and mechanistic information from RNA to protein to function, and their incorporation in electro-seq anal- ysis, will further advance our understanding of cellular dynamics and cell-state transition in biological cells, organoids, and tissues.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS  Cell lines Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC, hiPSC-IMR90-1) were obtained from the WiCell Research Institute (Madison, WI, USA). Authentication and testing for the mycoplasma were performed by the WiCell Research Institute. The use of Cells (hiPSC, hiPSC-IMR90-1) was approved/provided by the University of Wisconsin, agreement number 19-WO280. The human iPSC line (LMNA line) was obtained from Joseph C. Wu, MD, PhD at the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute. hiPSC and hiPSC-derived cardio- myocytes (CMs) were cultured at 37 \u0004C and 5% CO2 in Essential 8 medium (Gibco) and RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) plus 1% B27 supplement (Gibco), respectively.  Primary cells Primary hippocampal neurons were obtained from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The neurons were maintained at 37 \u0004C and 5% CO2 in NbActiv4 (NB4, BrainBits) medium.  METHOD DETAILS  Fabrication of stretchable mesh electrode array Fabrication of the ultra-\ufb02exible, stretchable mesh nanoelectronics was based on methods described previously.14,15,17,60 Key steps are described as follows: 4-inch glass wafers (Soda lime glass) were used as a transparent and insulating substrate for fabrication and cell culture. The glass wafers were cleaned with piranha solution (3:1 mixture of sulfuric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide), followed by rinsing with deionized (DI) water and drying with the N2. Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS, MicroChem) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm to increase the adhesion of photoresists with the substrate. LOR 3A (300 nm, MicroChem)/S1805 (500 nm, MicroChem) were spin- coated at 4000 rpm/4000 rpm, followed by baking at 180\u0004C for 5 mins and at 115 \u0004C for 1 min, respectively. Ni sacri\ufb01cial layer was exposed by using a Karl Suss MA6 mask aligner with 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) light at 40 mJ/cm2 and developed by CD-26 developer (MICROPOSIT) for 70 s. O2 plasma (Anatech Barrel Plasma System) was used for the removal of photoresist residues at 50 W for 30 s.

After patterning the Ni layer, SU-8 precursor (SU-8 2000[dot]5, MicroChem) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm, pre- baked at 65\u0004C / 95\u0004C for 2 mins each, exposed to 365 nm UV at 200 mJ/cm2, post-baked at 65\u0004C / 95\u0004C for 2 mins each, developed using SU-8 developer (MicroChem) for 60 s, rinsed by isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 30 s, blow for drying by N2 gun, and hard-baked at 180\u0004C for 40 mins to de\ufb01ne mesh-like SU-8 400-nm-thick patterns as the bottom encapsulation layer. After patterning the SU-8 bot- tom layer, HMDS/LOR3A/S1805 photoresist layers were spin-coated as described above, followed by depositing 5/40/5-nm-thick chromium/gold/chromium (Cr/Au/Cr) by the electron-beam evaporator (Denton), and the standard lift-off procedure in the remover PG (MicroChem) overnight to de\ufb01ne the Cr/Au/Cr interconnects. Then, the same photolithography process was used to de\ufb01ne 5/50- nm-thick chromium/platinum (Cr/Pt) as electrodes. After patterning electrodes, the top SU-8 encapsulating layer was patterned us- ing the same method described for patterning the bottom SU-8 layer. Finally, \ufb02uorescent E-barcodes were de\ufb01ned by patterning the SU-8 structure doped by adding 0[dot]004 wt& of Rhodamine 6G powder (Sigma-Aldrich) into the SU-8 precursor.  Connection of mesh electrode array with cable Next, the \ufb02exible \ufb02at cable (FFC, Molex) was soldered onto the input/output pads using a \ufb02ip-chip bonder (Finetech Fineplacer), fol- lowed by gluing a culture chamber onto the substrate wafer to completely enclose the mesh part of the device using a biocompatible adhesive (Kwik-Sil, WPI). Then, Pt black (PtB) was electroplated on the Pt electrode array using a precursor of 0[dot]08 wt% chloropla- tinic acid (H2PtCl6) solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in H2O. The precursor was drop-casted onto the device, followed by passage of a 1 mA/cm2 DC electric current density for 3 mins using mesh electrodes as anodes and an external Pt wire as the cathode. The device was then rinsed with DI water for 30 s and dried by N2. Finally, the surface of the device was treated with oxygen plasma (Anatech 106 oxygen plasma barrel asher), followed by adding 1 mL of Ni etchant (type TFB, Transene) into the chamber for 2 to 4 hours to completely release the mesh electronics from the glass substrate. The device was then ready for subsequent sterilization steps before cell culture.  Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the electrodes were measured based on methods described previously.61 The three- electrodes setup was used to measure the EIS of each electrode. A standard silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode and platinum wire (300 mm in diameter, 1[dot]5 cm in length immersed) were used as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The device was immersed in 1 X PBS solution (Thermo\ufb01sher) during measurement. The SP-150 potentiostat (Bio-logic), along with its commercial software EC-lab, was used to perform the measurements. For each measurement, at least three frequency sweeps were measured from 1 MHz down to 1 Hz to obtain statistical results. A sinusoidal voltage of 100 mV peak-to-peak was applied. For each data point, the response to 10 consecutive sinusoids (spaced out by 10% of the period duration) was accumulated and averaged.  Cell culture and cardiomyocytes differentiation Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC, hiPSC-IMR90-1) were obtained from the WiCell Research Institute (Madison, WI, USA). Authentication and testing for the mycoplasma were performed by the WiCell Research Institute. The human iPSC line (LMNA line) was obtained from Joseph C. Wu, MD, PhD at the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute. hiPSC cells were cultured on a Ma- trigel-coated 6-well plate with Essential 8 medium (Gibco). The medium was changed daily. The cells were passaged every 3-4 days. hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were generated according to the methods described previously with minor modi\ufb01cation.34,42,62 The hiPSC cells were cultured on a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate with Essential 8 medium to 70% - 80% con\ufb02uency before initiating car- diac differentiation. The \ufb01rst day was de\ufb01ned as Day 0. For cardiac differentiation, the cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) plus 1% B27-insulin (Gibco). CHIR99021 (12 mM; BioVision) was applied on Day 0 for hiPSC-IMR90-1 cells while CHIR99021 (6 mM; BioVision) was applied on Day 0 to Day 1 for LMNA hiPSC cells according to the previous protocol;42 IWR1 (5 mM; Cayman) was applied from Day 3 to Day 4. The cardiac cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium plus 1% B27 (Gibco) from Day 7, and the medium was changed every other day accordingly. Only the batches of hiPSC-CMs passed quality control - namely, showing clear beating on Day 8 of differentiation, were used for in situ electro-seq experiments. Primary hippocampal neurons were obtained from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The medium NbActiv4 (NB4, BrainBits) were used for the primary neuron cultures. All exper- iments involving human cells were approved by the Harvard University IRB and ESCRO committees.  Calcium imaging For 2D cardiomyocyte calcium imaging, the cells at Day 9 of differentiation were dissociated into single cells and seeded onto the glass-bottom 12-well plate. On Day 12, Day 21, Day 46, and Day 64 of differentiation, 5 mM Oregon Green\u0002488 BAPTA-1 (Invitrogen) was applied for 30 min and washed with DPBS. Then the cells were imaged using Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope. For locating the electrical recorded cells, the cardiomyocytes were seeded onto the unreleased mesh electronics. After one week culture, 5 mM Oregon Green\u0002488 BAPTA-1 (Invitrogen) was applied for 30 mins and washed with DPBS. Electrical signal was recorded and then the cells were imaged using Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope.  ll  Cell 186, 2002\u20132017.e1\u2013e8, April 27, 2023 e4  Resource",

      "text": "Integration of mesh electronics with cardiac and neural patches First, the released stretchable mesh electronics in the culture chamber was rinsed with DI water, decontaminated by 70% ethanol and incubated with Poly-D-lysine hydrobromide (0[dot]01% w/v) overnight followed by coating with Matrigel solution (100 mg/mL) for about 1 hour at 37 \u0004C. Then, the device was pre-chilled on an ice bag in the biosafety hood, and then 70 mL Matrigel solution (10 mg/mL) was added from the edge of the chamber, ensuring that the Matrigel covered the entire bottom substrate of the cell cul- ture chamber underneath the stretchable mesh electronics. Next, the device was transferred into the incubator for at least 30 mins at 37\u0004C to cure the Matrigel solution into a Matrigel hydrogel layer. Finally, hiPSC-CMs were incubated with 0[dot]05% Trypsin-EDTA so- lution (Gibco) for 5 mins and then dissociated into single cells. Cell counting and viability were assessed by trypan blue (Gibco) stain- ing method. 4 million cells (live cell percentage > 85%) were suspended in 1 mL RPMI 1640 medium plus 1% B27 and then transferred onto the cured electronics / Matrigel hybrids in the cell culture chamber and maintained at 37\u0004C, 5% CO2. 5 mM rock inhibitor (Y27632) was added to the medium in the \ufb01rst day to improve the cell viability. The CMs formed a continuous cell patch with the stretchable mesh electronics embedded within 24-48 hours. The cell culture medium was changed every other day. For neural patch integration, the primary hippocampal neurons were kindly obtained from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Single cells were seeded onto the mesh electronics. Cells were cultured in NbActiv4 medium (NB4, BrainBits). No medium changes were done in the \ufb01rst three days and then half were changed every other day afterwards.  Electrophysiological measurement The Blackrock CerePlex Direct voltage ampli\ufb01er along with a 32-channel Blackrock m digital headstage connected to the device were used to record electrical activity from the samples. The culture medium was grounded by a Pt electrode. A second Pt electrode was used as a reference electrode. During electrical measurement, samples were placed on a battery powered warming plate that main- tained thermostatic 37\u0004C. The measurement setup was placed into a Faraday cage. A sampling rate of 10,000 Hz was used for the electrical recording. The cell electrical activities were recorded every 3 days. MATLAB and Python codes provided by Blackrock were used to load, view, and convert raw data \ufb01les into an accessible format for data analysis. For drug tests,17,63 the electrical signal was recorded, and then 100 mM blebblistatin (Sigma-Aldrich) or 1 mM norepinephrine (Fisher) was injected into the cell culture medium of the samples. The electrical signal before and after the drug application was recorded. Data analysis and statistical tests were per- formed by GraphPad Prism.  Immunostaining and imaging Cells maintained on 2D surfaces were \ufb01xed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 15 mins, permeabilized with 0[dot]25% Triton X-100 for 15 mins and blocked with 5% donkey serum for 1 hour. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies (HCN4, AB5808, Sigma-Aldrich; MYH6, AMAB90950, Sigma-Aldrich; TNT, MA5-12960, Invitrogen; a-actinin, A7811, Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 \u0004C overnight. After extensive washing, secondary antibodies were applied and incubated for another 2 hours at room tempera- ture. Finally, 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, D9542, Sigma-Aldrich) was added and stained for 10 mins at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS three times before imaging using Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope. For cell-electronics hybrid stain- ing, the samples were cleared and immunostained as previously described.14 The primary antibodies were stained for 4 days, and the secondary antibodies were stained for 2 days, respectively. The samples were submerged in optical clearing solution overnight and embedded in 1% agarose gel before imaging using Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope. Imaging was analyzed by Fiji.  In situ sequencing Probes for cardiac and neural patches in situ sequencing were listed in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. In situ sequencing experi- ments were performed based on methods described previously with some modi\ufb01cations.18 Brie\ufb02y, the custom padlock probe and primer hybridize to mRNAs of the 3D cell-electronics hybrid, followed by enzymatic ligation and rolling circle ampli\ufb01cation (RCA) to construct in situ cDNA amplicons. The amplicons are then copolymerized with acrylamide, forming a hydrogel network. A gene-speci\ufb01c identi\ufb01er in the probe is ampli\ufb01ed and decoded through multiple sequencing cycles (Figure 1G). Glass-bottom 12-well plates (Mattek, P12G-1[dot]5-14-F) were \ufb01rst treated with oxygen plasma for 5 mins (Anatech Barrel Plasma System, 100W, 40% O2) followed by methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (Bind-Silane) solution (88% ethanol, 10% acetic acid, 1% Bind-Silane, 1% H2O) treatment for 1 hour. The 12-well plates were then rinsed with ethanol for 3 times and were left to dry at room temperature (R.T) for 3 hours. The 12-well plates were further treated with 0[dot]1 mg/mL of Poly-D-lysine solution for 1 hour at R.T. followed by 3 times rinsing with H2O. The plates were air-dried for 1 hour at R.T. Micro cover glasses (12 mm) were pretreated with Gel Slick at R.T. for 10 mins and were then air-dried before using. The cardiac or neural patch was \ufb01xed with 1 mL 1[dot]6% PFA for 30 mins at R.T. and then washed with PBS 3 times for 10 mins each time. The sample was then transferred from the chamber to the 12-well plates and permeabilized with 1 mL (0[dot]1 M glycine, 0[dot]1 U/mL SUPERase$In, 0[dot]5% Triton-X 100 in PBS) for 30 mins. The sample was washed with 1 mL PBST (0[dot]1% Triton-X 100 in PBS) 3 times for 10 mins each. The sample was then incubated in 1X hybridization buffer (2X SSC, 10% formamide, 1% Triton-X 100, 20 mM RVC, 0[dot]1 mg/mL yeast tRNA, 0[dot]2% SDS and pooled SNAIL probes at 20 nM per oligo) in a 40 \u0004C humidi\ufb01ed oven with gentle shaking for 48 hours. The sample was washed with 1 mL PBSTV (1% RVC in PBST) at 37\u0004C 3 times for 20 mins each and washed with high salt buffer (4X SSC in PBST) for another 20 mins at 37\u0004C, and then washed with PBST three times for 10 mins each at R.T.

The sample was incubated in 1 mL RCA mixture (1:50 Phi29 DNA polymerase, 250 mM dNTP, 1:100 BSA, 0[dot]2 U/mL SUPERase$In and 20 mM 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP) at 4\u0004C for 1 hour before incubating at 30\u0004C for 6 hours and then washed with 1 mL PBST 3 times for 10 mins each. The sample was incubated with 20 mM methacrylic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (dissolved in DMSO) in PBST for 3 hours at R.T. and washed with PBST 3 times for 10 mins each. The sample was then incubated with monomer buffer (4% acrylamide, 0[dot]2% bis-acrylamide, 2X SSC) overnight at R.T. The buffer was then aspirated and 55 mL of polymerization mixture (0[dot]2% ammonium persulfate, 0[dot]2% tetramethylethylenediamine dissolved in monomer buffer) was added to the sample. The Gel Slick coated coverslip was immediately put on the sample and the polymer- ization was conducted in an N2 container for 90 mins. The sample was then washed with PBST 3 times for 10 mins each. Five cycles of sequencing experiments were performed to decode gene identity. Within each cycle, the sample was \ufb01rst treated with a stripping buffer (60% formamide, 0[dot]1% Triton-X-100) at R.T. for 6 times, 15 mins each, followed by PBST wash for 6 times, 10 mins each. Then the sample was incubated with the sequencing mixture (1:25 T4 DNA ligase, 1:100 BSA, 10 mM reading probe, and 5 mM \ufb02uorescent oligos) at R.T. for 12 hours. Then the sample was washed by the washing and imaging buffer (2XSSC, 10% formamide and 0[dot]1% Triton-X-100) for 5 times, 10 mins each. DAPI was dissolved in PBST and used for nuclei staining for 20 mins. Finally, the sample was immersed in the washing and imaging buffer for imaging. Image acquisition was performed with Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with 25X water-immersion objective (NA 0[dot]95), with a voxel size around 230 nm X 230 nm X 570 nm.  Calcium imaging analysis For hiPSC-CMs during development, the calcium image was \ufb01rst segmented using the watershed segmentation method; the calcium signal trace was then normalized for each segmented cell. The \ufb01ndpeaks function in MATLAB(2019b) was used to detect each cal- cium spike, and all detected spikes for the cell were averaged. The averaged spike for each cell was then used for principal compo- nent analysis and clustering to determine calcium clusters with Seurat V4.  Sarcomere analysis Sarcomere analysis was performed as previously described.64 Brie\ufb02y, the a-actinin \ufb02uorescence image was segmented using the watershed segmentation method. Then the sarcomere organization score was calculated for each segmented cell using the Haralick correlation value, which is the correlation value of the co-occurrence matrix for given orientation and pixel pair offset distances. The height of the highest peak among all the orientation and pixel offset distances is de\ufb01ned as the sarcomere organization score for the cell.  In situ sequencing analysis A customized computational pipeline was built with MATLAB (2019b) to decode gene identity and quantify the gene expression level of each cell from the in situ sequencing images. First, sequencing \ufb02uorescence images were preprocessed with top-hat \ufb01ltering by a disk structuring element (radius = 3) to remove the background noise. Second, the contrast of the image for each channel from the second to \ufb01fth sequencing cycle was adjusted to match the image from the \ufb01rst cycle with histogram matching function \u2018\u2018imhist- matchn\u2019\u2019. Third, the composite \ufb02uorescence images for the second to \ufb01fth cycle were registered with the composite \ufb02uorescence image from the \ufb01rst cycle using the phase correlation algorithm followed by local distortion registration with function \u2018\u2018imregdemons\u2019\u2019. Fourth, the dots of amplicon locations were identi\ufb01ed from images in the \ufb01rst cycle by a 3D regional maximum detection algorithm implemented in function \u2018\u2018imregionalmax\u2019\u2019. Then the dominant color of every identi\ufb01ed dot in each cycle was determined by a voxel volume surrounding its centroid location. The color sequence for each dot was decoded as a gene barcode and compared with the code-book. Fifth, cell segmentation was performed with ClusterMap,29 then RNA reads were assigned to the segmented cells accordingly. Python package Scanpy54 was used for the single-cell gene expression analysis. Cells expressing less than 40 gene counts or only expressing three kinds of gene were \ufb01ltered out. Gene counts of each cell were normalized so that the total count of all genes in each cell equaled the median number of total counts across all cells. The normalized count value was then log-transformed with log (x+1). Combat55 was used to remove the potential batch effect among different imaging positions. Each gene in the cell-by-gene matrix was scaled to unit variance and zero mean followed by dimensionality reduction with principal components analysis (PCA). Based on the explained variance ratio, the top principal-components were used to construct the k nearest neighbor (kNN) graph for Leiden clus- tering.30 UMAP28 was used to visualize the 2D representation of each cell. Monocle 337 was used to compute pseudotime along the cell trajectory.  Locating recorded hiPSC-CMs We used a custom-built pipeline based on scikit-image v0[dot]19.2 and opencv-python v4[dot]5.5[dot]64.59 Electrode position was located using the 3D electrode image collected by re\ufb02ection-mode and bright-\ufb01eld imaging and identi\ufb01ed by the E-barcode positions. The elec- trode position in x and y coordinates was determined by the following steps: the electrode image was \ufb01rst projected to the x-y plane by maximum intensity projection (MIP) and transferred to gray-scale (pixel value ranging from 0-255). Then the MIP image was \ufb01ltered with a global threshold of 50 to remove the non-electrode background. A 201-by-201 pixel size gaussian \ufb01lter was applied to adaptively \ufb01lter out the non-circular area, which is the interconnect of the electrode.

      "text": "the z coordinate of the electrode position was determined by \ufb01tting a 2D linear plane surface. The electrically recorded cell was further determined by calculating the area of intersection between each neighborhood hiPSC-CM and the electrode. The cell with the largest intersection area was identi\ufb01ed as the electrically recorded cell. For hiPSC-CM samples, we used (i) high-density electrode arrays (electrode-to-electrode distance of 60 mm) to record 47% \u00b1 6% of hiPSC-CMs and (ii) sparsely distributed electrode arrays (elec- trode-to-electrode distance of 480 mm) to record 3[dot]4% \u00b1 0[dot]9% of hiPSC-CMs. In our system, 12% of electrodes were in contact with multiple cells, 53% of electrodes were in contact with single cells, and 35% of electrodes were in contact with small cell frag- ments or had no contact with cells.  hiPSC-CM electrophysiology data processing We followed the procedure of SpikeInterface v0[dot]958 to detect the spikes which passed the threshold in one channel. Each spike has a \ufb01xed length of 1[dot]6 second with the sampling rate of 10 kHz. After spike detection, the spikes were aligned at the minimum of the cor- responding spike dv/dt, and then averaged to get a spike representation of that channel. For each spike representation, we \ufb01rst denoised the spike with wavelet denoising using PyWavelets v1[dot]1.0[dot]56 Then, the spike fea- tures were extracted through two cycles of down sampling operations. We \ufb01rst down sampled the whole 1[dot]6 second length spike to 22 points (zoomed-out binning) and then down sampled the 0[dot]15 second length spike near the minimum of the differentiated spike to 40 points (zoomed-in binning). In total, we generated 62 feature points for each spike representation of each channel.  Spike sorting Neural patch electrical recordings were \ufb01rst bandpass \ufb01ltered with the frequency range from 300 to 3,000 Hz. To obtain the spike waveforms, the spike detection threshold was set as 5 times of standard deviations away from the mean and the minimum time be- tween spikes was set as 3 ms Segments in a time window of 3 ms with 1 ms before the trough of the waveform and 2 ms after the trough were extracted. Spike sorting was then conducted with MountainSort57 and SpikeInterface.58  Locating recorded neurons To identify electrically recorded neurons, we computed the spatial average positions across channels that recorded the same neu- rons and weighted the components with the square of the average waveform amplitude of each channel.31 For neuron samples, we used high-density electrode arrays (electrode-to-electrode distance of 60 mm) to record 82% \u00b1 4% of neurons.  Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN) The WNN,36 that is FindMultiModalNeighbors function from Seurat v4, was used to integrate the gene expression and electrophysiology data collected by in situ electro-seq. The principal component dimensionality for gene expression and electrophysiology was set as 7 and 6 (the elbow point in PCA variance), respectively. k = 20 was used to \ufb01nd the k nearest neighbor and calculate the modality-spe- ci\ufb01c weights. A WNN graph integrating information of electrophysiology and gene expression was then built for downstream analysis including joint clustering (Leiden),30 UMAP joint visualization and pseudotime derivation (Monocle3).  Pseudotime analysis We used the R package Monocle3 for the pseudotime calculation of gene expression, electrophysiology features and the WNN joint representation described above. A set of hyperparameters (Euclidean distance ratio = 2, geodesic distance ratio = 2/3 , minimal branch length = 5) in function learn-graph was used to \ufb01rst learn a principal graph of development. The node at the position of earliest stage was manually chosen as the root of principal graph to \ufb01nalize the trajectory. Then the function order_cells was used to calculate the pseudotime.  Sparse reduced-rank regression (RRR) model and bibiplot For the sparse RRR analysis,38 we used 62 electrophysiological features across all electrically recorded hiPSC-CMs. Both electro- physiological features and gene expression were normalized and z-scored as described above. In brief, sparse RRR \ufb01nds a linear mapping of gene expression levels to a low-dimensional latent representation, from which the electrophysiological features are then inferred with another linear transformation. The results were visualized by paired and aligned electrophysiological biplot and transcriptional biplot. Each biplot is composed of dots and lines. Each dot in the biplot represents a cell with paired measurements, with the x and y coordinates respectively representing Components 1 and 2 values in the aligned electrophysiological and transcrip- tional space. Each line in the biplot represents an E feature or gene. The sparse RRR model selected a set of genes for visualization in the transcriptional biplot that best explains electrophysiological variability. The x and y coordinates of each line\u2019s tip in the biplot indi- cate the contribution of the corresponding E feature or gene to Component 1 and Component 2, respectively. Comparing the direc- tions of lines between the electrophysiological and transcriptional biplot can suggest which E features are correlated with which genes (Figure 6C). In Figures S5K and S5L, cross-validation was done by using 10 folds, elastic net a-values 0[dot]25, 0[dot]5, 0[dot]75, and 1[dot]0, and l-values from 0[dot]2 to 6[dot]0. In Figures 6C, a model with rank r = 5, ridge penalty (a = 0[dot]5), and lasso penalty (l = 1[dot]5) was used to yield a selection of genes. Following the method,35,38 we selected the most stable results from the sparse RRR analysis. Spe- ci\ufb01cally, we run the sparse RRR in 100 repetitions, and only genes that appeared more than 50 times were selected for the down- stream analysis.  ll  e7 Cell 186, 2002\u20132017.e1\u2013e8, April 27, 2023  Resource",

      "text": "We used 10 times repeated 10-fold cross-validation to tune the regularization strength (Figures S5K and S5L). The selected model chose genes with a 5-dimensional latent space and achieved a cross-validated R2 of 0[dot]2. The cross-validated correlation between the \ufb01rst two pairs of projections was 0[dot]69 and 0[dot]49, respectively. These \ufb01rst two components roughly separate CM groups by their days of differentiation. These different groups show distinct genes correlated with electrophysiology features.  Coupled autoencoder model A coupled autoencoder39,40 was used for cross-modal inference. Speci\ufb01cally, the following hyperparameters were used: latent loss weight =1, Adam optimizer with learning rate = 0[dot]0001, batch size = 10, training epoch = 15, epoch step = 1000. The latent dimen- sionality was set to d = 2 in order to capture the variability in the dataset. The genes selected by the sparse RRR model, and all 62 elec- trophysiological features were used as inputs for the coupled autoencoder. To validate the cross-modal inference performance of the coupled autoencoder, 5-fold cross-validation was applied. Cells collected on Day 12, Day 21, Day 46, and Day 64 were randomly divided into 5 equal subsets. The coupled autoencoder was trained on 4 of the 5 subsets (training data), and then evaluated on the remaining 1 subset (validation data). This process was repeated 5 times, with each subset serving as the validation data exactly once. The performance across all 5 iterations was then used as the overall performance in downstream evaluations. After training the coupled autoencoder network, we applied the pre-trained coupled autoencoder to infer temporal gene expres- sion change from the continuous electrical recording of the same sample (Figure 7G). Speci\ufb01cally, the electrical activity of a cardiac sample was measured by the embedded electrodes from Day 17 to Day 64 of differentiation. Then a temporal gene expression pro\ufb01le from Day 17 to Day 64 of differentiation was inferred. To apply the pre-trained coupled autoencoder model to LMNA-mutant hiPSC-CMs, we used the gene expression changes in LMNA-mutant hiPSC-CMs from previously reported data42 to infer the electrophysiological waveform (Figures 7H and 7I). Then, the inferred LMNA-mutant hiPSC-CM electrophysiological waveform was compared to the waveform of LMNA-mutant hiPSC- CMs measured by mesh electronics. Additionally, random shuf\ufb02e was performed as a negative control to further demonstrate that the inference of LMNA-mutant hiPSC-CMs was not due to coincidence. The gene expression changes in LMNA-mutant hiPSC-CMs were randomly shuf\ufb02ed and then used as input to the trained coupled autoencoder. The random shuf\ufb02e was repeated 10 times for statistical reliability. We acknowledge that the randomness in the neural network training may lead to slight differences in the results of sparse RRR and coupled autoencoder analyses.  QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  Statistical analysis was performed by GraphPad Prism. The statistical details of experiments can be found in the \ufb01gure legends.
