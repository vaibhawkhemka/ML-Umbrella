ABSTRACT Cellular operators deploy 4G License Assisted Access (LAA) and 5G NR-U base stations in the unlicensed spectrum to enhance overall network capacity. This work highlights a unique phenomenon related to Physical Cell Id (PCI) that is observed in public LAA operator deployments. Notably, the licensed and unlicensed carriers of a device may have the same PCI or different PCIs. The phenomenon is triggered by the combined effect of unlicensed deployment architectures and cell selection mechanisms. Consequently, the phenomenon will intensify in the 5G NR-U, whose public deployment will soon begin. Unfortunately, the impact of this phenomenon on coexistence network performance is unexplored. It is also desirable to accurately identify the PCI scenarios at the device for improved cell selection and network performance. However, the data imbalance makes the classi\ufb01cation problem challenging. This work addresses these problems through the following approach. Operator data from three LAA cellular providers is gathered and analyzed using machine learning algorithms. The impact of the phenomenon on LTE, LAA, and Wi-Fi components is demonstrated in three steps: First, the variation in network performance prediction accuracy in the PCI scenarios is examined. Second, the ef\ufb01cacy of numerosity reduction techniques used in data-driven cell selection is evaluated in both PCI scenarios. The third step entails a comparison of operator data analysis with network measurements. On-site experiments are conducted at the same PCI and different PCI sites to study differences in real-time network performance. A controlled LTE-WiFi coexistence environment is created and multiple traf\ufb01c categories are considered. Finally, a class-weight-based solution is proposed for PCI scenario identi\ufb01cation. F-score of 0[dot]75 and AUC-ROC of 0[dot]84 is achieved for LAA, with a minimalist feature set consisting of SINR and Throughput.

As de\ufb01ned by 3GPP, \u2018\u2018Carrier aggregation with at least one Secondary Cell (Scell) operating in the unli- censed spectrum is referred to as Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA)\u2019\u2019 [2]. LTE-LAA deployments proliferated rapidly around the world, with 38 operators offering or planning to deploy LAA services in 21 countries [3]. Buoyed by the quick adoption and success of LAA coexistence deployments, 5G New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) has been introduced as an evolutionary enhancement of LTE-LAA, under the 3GPP release 16 speci\ufb01cations. Furthermore, the Federal Commu- nications Commission and the European Commission have both proposed rules for unlicensed coexistence in the 6 GHz (5925 MHz-7125 MHz) band for NR-U operation [4], [5]. The improved network performance offered by LTE-LAA depends on ef\ufb01cient cell selection by its Licensed and Unlicensed carrier components. Being a novel coexistence framework, LTE-LAA is characteristically different from tra- ditional LTE heterogeneous networks (HetNets) in terms of deployment architecture, backhaul connectivity, and impact of external co-channel interference from Wi-Fi transmis- sions [6], [7]. Therefore, the cell selection mechanisms employed by cellular operators in LTE HetNets based on the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and trans- mission power are not suitable for LTE-LAA deployments. Although solutions for LTE HetNets/LTE-LAA cell asso- ciation have been proposed, they are based on simulation or validated on network prototypes [8], [9]. More recently, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of cell selection on the performance of the LTE-LAA network and its Licensed and Unlicensed components has been performed using real-world LAA operator data [10], [11]. In addition, cell quality metrics derived from operator data have been proposed to improve the existing LAA cell selection mechanisms [10], [11].  FIGURE 1. Coexistence PCI scenarios - A new phenomenon.  Despite the attention that LTE-LAA has received from industry and academia, a peculiar aspect of the current LAA deployment architecture is overlooked in the LAA literature. Cellular providers aim to minimize feedback delay from user equipment (UE) and carrier aggregation (dual connectivity),  while planning coexistence deployments. Hence, macro and small cells are usually placed in close proximity, and may often be co-located on the same physical structure, such as a street-lamp/electricity pole. Thus, the LTE (Licensed) and LAA (Unlicensed) components of the network may share the same Physical Cell ID (PCI). But operator data reveals that the Licensed and Unlicensed carries of a UE may also be camped on different cells or cells with different physical locations. This creates a different PCI scenario, as shown in Figure 1. The existence of these PCI scenarios, viz, \u2018\u2018Same PCI\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Different PCI,\u2019\u2019 is a novel phenomenon that is unique to LTE-WiFi coexistence environment. The two PCI scenarios differ in several respects, espe- cially network performance. While LAA supports only Car- rier Aggregation, NR-U will also support Dual Connectivity and Standalone unlicensed modes. Thus, this phenomenon is bound to intensify in NR-U deployments with respect to the frequency of occurrence and the multitude of PCI scenar- ios. Moreover, the amount of spectrum available at 6 GHz is higher compared to 5 GHz, and a higher rate of carrier aggregation per UE is possible in the 5G NR-U system. Con- sequently, the impact of unlicensed PCI scenarios in 5G NR- U will also be much greater than in LAA. Thus, their analysis is important not only from the perspective of optimizing existing LAA performance but also for the upcoming NR-U deployments.  II. CHALLENGES AND CONTRIBUTIONS  From a Radio Resource Management (RRM) perspective, it is pertinent to study how the performance of the coexistence system varies when the Licensed and Unlicensed network components are attached to same or different PCIs.  A. RESEARCH PROBLEMS IN CELL SELECTION  Thus, cellular operator data needs to be analyzed to study the frequency of occurrence of the two scenarios and the distri- bution of important network variables in them. Data analysis is necessary to understand how the relationships between network variables differ in the two scenarios. More impor- tantly, the variation in network performance and the ability to accurately predict expected capacity is of great interest. These tasks can typically be performed through machine learning (ML) algorithms. The PCI scenarios should also be investigated for other aspects of difference they cause in the network environment. The performance of data reduction mechanisms that are often used to help expedite data-driven cell selection by the cellular operator is one such example. Additionally, differences in network performance should also be investigated through on-site measurements, that is by monitoring the LTE, LAA, and Wi-Fi networks in the two scenarios. Network performance may also vary depending on the type of traf\ufb01c requested by the UE, QoS constraints, and interference from coexisting Wi-Fi access points (APs) in the unlicensed spectrum. The effect of PCI scenarios on network performance ought to be validated through real-time experiments, on both the cellular (Licensed and Unlicensed)  VOLUME 10, 2022 87283",

It is relevant to see how Wi-Fi performance varies when coexisting with same PCI and different PCI LAA con\ufb01gurations. Moreover, on-site experiments should ideally consider multiple types of traf\ufb01c for a comprehensive evaluation. Equally important is the awareness of the PCI scenarios at the UE, as they are intricately associated with the cell selection decisions of the Licensed and Unlicensed compo- nents. Having an awareness of the PCI scenario will help an end-user device make informed cell selection decisions. The \ufb01rst step in that direction would be to accurately identify and differentiate between the two coexistence scenarios with a minimal feature vector. This is a challenging problem, given the inherent imbalance in the occurrence of the two scenarios in current LAA deployments. These challenges must be addressed, as LAA deployments serve as a precursor to future NR-U deployments, where a lot more complex con\ufb01gurations are possible. For example, it is possible that NR-Licensed, NR-U, LTE, and LAA small cells are located on adjacent poles, leading to far more com- plex PCI scenarios. Thus, cell selection decisions resulting from awareness of PCI scenarios will ensure better network performance for the end-user. However, to the best of our knowledge, no major study has investigated the current LAA deployments for the phe- nomenon of coexistence PCI scenarios and the challenges they present.  B. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS  The proposed work analyzes LTE-LAA deployments through \ufb01eld experiments, measurements, and machine learning-based operator data modeling, with the vision to \ufb01nd solutions for upcoming NR-U deployments. The major research contributions are elucidated below.  \u2022 Operator Data gathering and extraction: To study the variation in the prediction of network performance in the two PCI scenarios, LTE-LAA operator data is gathered from the deployments of three cellular operators active in downtown Chicago, that is AT&T, T-Mobile, and Ver- izon. Using computer vision and deep learning-based  tesseract engine, network data is extracted from video logs to generate a data set of over 7000 data points.  \u2022 Impact Assessment of PCI Scenarios A PCI sce- nario speci\ufb01c distribution analysis of important net- work variables such as Throughput and SINR is performed. Further, the effect of PCI scenarios on network performance prediction and data reduction techniques in Licensed and Unlicensed components is explored and insightful inferences are drawn. This is done by analyzing the SINR-Capacity relationship through eight regression and supervised machine learn- ing algorithms, and two popular numerosity reduction algorithms.  \u2022 On-site Experiments: Operator sites with Same and Different PCI con\ufb01gurations are identi\ufb01ed using the Network Signal Guru (NSG) tool. Then, on-site exper- iments are conducted using multiple coexisting Wi-Fi hotspots. Variation in network performance is observed for both PCI scenarios by varying the type of traf\ufb01c, the number of interfering Wi-Fi hotspots, the distance etc Further, role of QoS constraints in LTE-LAA per- formance is explored through delay critical data traf\ufb01c. Metrics such as Throughput, Signal Strength, Resource Block allocation, and Latency are measured. Experi- ments are conducted for both cellular (LTE/LAA) and Wi-Fi sub-systems.  \u2022 Predicting PCI Scenarios A binary classi\ufb01cation model is designed that predicts the PCI scenario with high accuracy, in both Licensed and Unlicensed com- ponent. The proposed classi\ufb01cation model requires a minimalist two-variable feature set and overcomes the challenge of data imbalance between the two scenarios.  Finally, open research problems related to the PCI scenar- ios in the unlicensed coexistence networks are identi\ufb01ed and outlined.  III.

ROLE OF PCI IN CELL SELECTION  With the adoption and proliferation of new cellular standards, a wide variety of base stations, from Macro cells to low-power Femto cells, are being deployed. The consequent increase in network complexity presents new challenges in the plan- ning, management, and maintenance of cellular networks. Ef\ufb01cient operation of cellular networks, especially LAA/ 5G-NRU deployments, requires reliable mechanisms for net- work con\ufb01guration and recon\ufb01guration with minimal human intervention. This served as motivation for the paradigm of Self-Organizing Networks (SON), where seamless and unin- terrupted service is provided to the end-user through small cells capable of self-con\ufb01guration [12]. The \ufb01rst and most important step in a cellular SON is cell identi\ufb01cation, without which optimal cell selection and han- dover to user equipment (UE) is not possible. At the physical layer, the identi\ufb01cation of a cell/eNB is done with the help of Physical Cell Id (PCI) in LTE-A/LTE-LAA and 5G NR-U. PCI allocated to a cell/eNB (Figure 2(a)) is used to discover and identify the cell/eNB when a cellular device initiates the association process, or during a handover [13]. The high-level cell selection process in LTE, LTE-A, and LTE-LAA is pre- sented in Figure 2(b). In these cellular standards, the PCI of a cell is generated using the Primary Synchronization Sig- nal (PSS) and the Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS), using the expression (PCI = 3 \u00d7 SSS + PSS), where PSS \u2208 {0, 1, 2}, and SSS \u2208{0, . . . , 167}. Therefore, a typical PCI in LTE-LAA is always in the range of [0,503]. While PCIs in 5G NR/NR-U are generated in a similar fashion, 1008 unique PCIs are available, as SSS \u2208{0, . . . , 335}.  B. NEW CHALLENGES IN THE UNLICENSED BAND  Traditional LTE/LTE-A cell selection process is generally dependent on parameters such as RSRP, RSRQ, SINR and transmission power received at the UE. Although there is ample research to suggest that parameters associated with traf\ufb01c QoS (for example Guaranteed Bit Rate), traf\ufb01c-load, and power/energy consumption at the UE ought to be considered, operators prefer practical cell selection and handover mecha- nisms that are SINR driven [14]. The simple approach works for cellular operators viz, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint as  LTE/LTE-A HetNets do not suffer the adverse impact of inter- ference from external sources [15]. LTE/LTE-A networks operate in dedicated bands of the Licensed spectrum that are exclusive to speci\ufb01c cellular operators. Further, the co-tier and cross-tier interference experienced within the network is usually mitigated and managed through centralized and distributed resource allocation solutions [16]. In sharp contrast, unlicensed cellular networks have to contend with transmission con\ufb02icts from coexisting Wi-Fi APs on the same channel, which can drastically degrade the SINR. Furthermore, interference from rogue mobile hotspots and other sources, hidden node problems, and dense Wi-Fi (802[dot]11n/ac/ax) network deployments adversely affect SINR in an unlicensed coexistence system such as LAA. This is par- ticularly true in dense scenarios, where radio resources may not always be allocated to LAA. SINR-based cell selection is also less suitable in LAA due to interference from external Wi-Fi transmissions, which typically causes \ufb02uctuation in SINR received at the LAA UE. As a result, cell selection and handover decisions made at the UE trigger frequent disconnections and re-attachments, degrading LAA perfor- mance. Thus, for ef\ufb01cient cell selection and radio resource allocation in LAA, additional information about the small cell is necessary to determine cell quality [10], [17]. Case in point, when LTE and LAA share a PCI, it implies that they share the same LTE backhaul, that is LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC) with MME, P-GW, S-GW, HLR, etc, which ensures ef\ufb01cient splitting of resources. Additional sig- naling is required at the LAA secondary cell (Scell) for the UE to recognize that the component carrier belongs to the same LAA provider as the primary cell (Pcell), which in turn provides the Licensed carrier to the UE. In the Licensed band, PCI is suf\ufb01cient for cell identi\ufb01cation, since multiple operators share a carrier only if the operators: (a) provide cov- erage to spatially/geographically separated areas, or, (b) share the network. Despite these provisions, two major PCI related problems are encountered, which are illustrated in Figure 3(a) and brie\ufb02y described below:  1) PCI collision: Neighboring cells are assigned identical PCI, which poses a challenge during UE attachment and handovers.

    {
      "text": "S.M. Kala et al: Identification and Analysis of a Unique Cell Selection Phenomenon  2) PCI confusion: Two different small cells within the same macro Base Station (BS) are assigned identical PCI, which poses a challenge, especially during han- dovers. Since LTE-A/LAA has only 504 unique PCI values, strate- gic reuse and network planning provide reliable identi\ufb01cation of cells/eNBs. However, with increasing network density and low-power cell deployment, as shown in Figure 3(b), an LAA cell has to compete with other small cells and macro cells for a limited number of PCIs, leading to a higher frequency of PCI collisions and PCI confusions [12]. An important reason is that cells/eNBs of different operators belonging to different Public Land Mobile Network (PLMNN) may assign the same PCI to their respective eNBs [2], [18]. These challenges were adequately addressed in LTE/LTE-A networks through smart PCI allocation using mechanisms such as graph coloring, clustering, and network-initiated SI reading, since operators controlled the Licensed bands allocated to them [12], [19]. However, the solutions prescribed for the unlicensed band, viz, increasing the range of PCIs, broadcasting partly unique cell identities, and interoperator coordination are dif\ufb01cult to implement in a shared spectrum [18]. Furthermore, the complexity of these challenges will increase as cellular oper- ators and enterprise network providers deploy more Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) small cells operating on the LTE protocol stack [20]. The upcoming small cell deploy- ments in the C-band spectrum are also likely to intensify the contention in PCI ID allocation. Finally, 3GPP release 15 may also prescribe additional speci\ufb01cations for LAA processes [2]. For example, an LAA handover process entails the following speci\ufb01c steps. First, the eNB/small cell con\ufb01gures the UE with one Discovery Signal Measurement Timing Con\ufb01guration window on one frequency for the serving cell and for each available neigh- boring cell. Second, the UE utilizes the allocated window to identify and measure Discovery Reference Signals from the neighboring cells. Further, to overcome the challenges of hidden-nodes (unlike LTE/LTE-A), the UE may measure the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) during an RSSI measurement timing con\ufb01guration window and share the average RSSI and channel occupancy with the serving cell in the next reporting interval [2]. Solutions to the problems anticipated in LAA networks have been prescribed in 3GPP release 15, in 3GPP min- utes of meetings, and in recent research work [2], [6], [18]. Prior to the proliferation of public LAA deployments, the analysis and solutions for LAA were validated primarily through theoretical modeling, simulations, and experimental testbeds [21], [22], [23], [24]. After several cellular operators began offering LAA services globally, some studies have sought to conduct performance analysis of these networks through on-site measurements [6], [10], [25]. However, the new phenomenon observed in unlicensed deployments, which is presented in the next section, is not yet identi\ufb01ed, nor has its impact been analyzed using ML modeling and operator data analysis.  FIGURE 4. PCI scenarios in unlicensed networks.  IV. UNIQUE PCI PHENOMENON IN LAA DEPLOYMENTS  In the current coexistence deployments, the uplink transmis- sions are generally performed on the licensed spectrum and downlink transmissions on the LAA unlicensed spectrum. The strategy is designed to meet QoS requirements, reduce delay in ACK packets, and maximize power and spectral ef\ufb01ciency. In contrast, if the client is LTE-only, both uplink and downlink occur on the licensed LTE BS. However, cell selection in LTE-LAA coexistence networks involves addi- tional technical nuances due to the system architecture.  A. THE TWO PCI SCENARIOS  Data collected from coexistence deployments of the three operators in Chicago, viz, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile reveals that a typical LTE-LAA coexistence deployment may be broadly categorized into two PCI scenarios, depicted in Figure 4. \u2018\u2018Same PCI\u2019\u2019 represents the coexistence network architecture with Licensed (LTE) and Unlicensed (LAA) clients camped on the same cell, while \u2018\u2018Different PCI\u2019\u2019 depicts the case when they are latched on to different cells with different PCIs. An architectural representation of the two scenarios is shown in Figure 4. Same PCI is the dominant scenario and is observed in over 80% of the sample space. It also seems to be the preferred scenario for maximal network throughput, which is why cell selection solutions often focus on it [10], [11]. However, the occurrence of Different PCI scenarios in LAA operator data is signi\ufb01cant (18%) and cannot be overlooked [11]. Further, to the best of our knowl- edge, this is a hitherto unobserved phenomenon and unique to the coexistence paradigm. With the commencement of 5G- NRU operation in the 5GHz and 6GHz spectrum, taking the PCI scenarios into consideration will enhance coexistence network performance [6], [9]. These scenarios are the result of three network design fac- tors, viz, availability of space/structures for cell installation, availability of \ufb01ber optic-equipped backhaul connectivity, and operator deployment strategy. The LTE-LAA coexistence networks in the Chicago region have been deployed in both semi-indoor and outdoor environments. The operator data we  87286 VOLUME 10, 2022",

Channel access priority class in LAA downlink.  have gathered is for an outdoor setting, where the LTE-LAA cells have been installed on the street lights/electricity poles. The deployment plan is shaped not only by the availability of these poles but also by their type. Only some of these poles are structurally capable of providing a high-speed \ufb01ber optic connection to the backhaul. From the network planning perspective, this is an important consideration, because the Unlicensed carrier bandwidth is 3X that of the Licensed carrier, and the next-generation millimeter-wave networks offer up to 400 MHz bandwidth, which is 10X that of the current 5 GHz unlicensed bands [6]. Such speeds can only be serviced by a \ufb01ber optic connection to the backhaul. CapEx-QoS trade-off is another major consideration, as \ufb01ber optic cabling is expensive and is set to cost the 5G industry over $130 Billion in installation. These factors, coupled with market penetration of LAA equipped devices and subscriber density, determine operator deployment strategy and create the two PCI scenarios. Preliminary on-site measurements indicated that LAA per- formance in the two scenarios is likely to be different. When LTE and LAA have the same PCI, they share the back- haul, which facilitates ef\ufb01cient resource splitting and packet aggregation. Consequently, the LTE-LAA network perfor- mance analysis is usually limited to the Same PCI scenario [10], [11]. However, the two PCI scenarios may impact LAA and Wi-Fi network performance differently. Furthermore, the performance of the LAA uplink (UL) and the LAA downlink (DL) is likely to differ. This becomes important due to LAA mechanisms such as subframe and car- rier (pool-based) resource allocation schemes and group UL grant. The two PCI scenarios may in\ufb02uence the use of Group ID or PCI for multiplexed transmissions on the subframe [2], [18]. Thus, Same PCI and Different PCI con\ufb01gurations will affect LAA UL and DL mechanisms as well. Simi- larly, these PCI scenarios will affect the network throughput, resource allocation, and latency for different types of data traf\ufb01c depending on the respective Channel Access Priority Class. Equally importantly, the impact of LAA on the perfor- mance of coexisting Wi-Fi networks will also vary depend- ing on the type of coexistence PCI scenario. In this work, we explore these aspects through a PCI scenario-speci\ufb01c analysis of LAA deployment data.  B. RELEVANCE TO 5G NR-U  LAA is the evolutionary antecedent of NR-U, and the \ufb01rst commercially successful cellular-WiFi coexistence standard.  TABLE 2. Access categories in 802[dot]11ac.  As such, the unresolved challenges encountered in LAA will assume a different dimension and scale in NR-U. This is especially true for the phenomenon of PCI scenarios that has come to attention only through the analysis of LAA operator data. NR-U deployments will support three modes, viz, Carrier Aggregation, Dual Connectivity, and Standalone [26]. Apart from the fully unlicensed Standalone operation, the other two modes will operate in the 5GHz spectrum. This implies that the following can be present/co-located on a physical installation such as a pole or a lamppost:  \u2022 NR-U and NR Licensed  \u2022 NR-U alone in Standalone mode  \u2022 NR Licensed and LAA Unlicensed  \u2022 NR Licensed, NR-U and LAA  \u2022 LTE Licensed, NR Licensed, NR-U and LAA Compared to the LAA deployment scenarios shown in Figure 4, the above small cell combinations present in physical installations close to each other can lead to more complex PCI scenarios than LAA. Thus, analy- sis and solutions presented in this work will certainly guide solutions for cell-selection and network optimization in NR-U.  V. UNLICENSED COEXISTENCE: RELEVANT ASPECTS  This section discusses the aspects of coexistence in the unli- censed band that are relevant to the experiments and analysis presented in this work. These include the bands and channels on which LAA/NR-U and Wi-Fi operate, the feasibility of bandwidth combinations, channel access mechanisms, and Channel Access Priority Class (CAPC).  A. THE 5 GHz UNLICENSED BAND  The 5 GHz Unlicensed National Information Infrastruc- ture bands (U-NII bands) range from 5[dot]15 to 5[dot]85 GHz. Recently, a U-NII-4 band with 4 channels spanning 5[dot]85 Ghz\u20135[dot]925 GHz, has been noti\ufb01ed by the Federal  VOLUME 10, 2022 87287",

Thus, a total of eight U-NII ranges have been prescribed by FCC, of which 1 to 4 lie in the 5 Ghz range and 5 to 8 are for 6 GHz. LAA coexists with IEEE 802[dot]11a and higher Wi-Fi standards in the 5 Ghz spec- trum. Each U-NII band is governed by certain guidelines and restrictions with respect to usage and operation. For example, U-NII 1 (5[dot]150\u20135[dot]250 GHz) is a low power band, which has no restrictions apart from being limited to indoor use with 50 mW of maximum transmission power. U-NII-2 is assigned mainly to radar systems. Therefore, unlicensed devices communicating in the band have to necessarily imple- ment Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS), giving priority to the radar signals. As a result, this band is seldom utilized by LAA and Wi-Fi. Therefore, although a substantial block of 560 MHz of spectrum seems available, a much smaller fraction of about 160 MHz belonging to U-NII-1 and U-NII-3 bands is fully harnessed. It is noteworthy that Wi-Fi channels are 20/40/80 MHz wide, while 3GPP has speci\ufb01ed 20 Mhz channels for LAA, with the possibility of aggregating up to 3 LAA channels.  B. CHANNEL ACCESS PRIORITY CLASSES  An operator uses Channel Access Priority Classes (CAPCs) for speci\ufb01c types of traf\ufb01c when UEs transmit data on the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) over an LAA carrier. Four CAPCs are speci\ufb01ed for LAA in 3GPP Release 15 [2]. Table 1 presents the details of the LAA DL CAPC classes along with speci\ufb01c values for each class for parameters viz, QoS Class Identi\ufb01er (QCI), Clear Channel Assess- ment (CCA) duration, maximum and minimum contention windows (CWMax, CWMin), and Transmission Opportunity (TXOP) duration. A data traf\ufb01c category is assigned a spe- ci\ufb01c TXOP duration based on its CAPC. For example, video and voice data have TXOPs of 3 ms and 2 ms, respectively, to meet end-user QoS guarantees. Given the low latency requirements of these data \ufb02ows, small data packets are used. In contrast, for traf\ufb01c categories such as data download in the background and best-effort, LAA employs large packets to optimize network throughput with a maximum TXOP of 8 ms To meet QoS guarantees, 3GPP prescribes that operators use CAPCs according to the standardized QCI to which the data traf\ufb01c belongs. However, operators are free to employ their own non-standardized QCIs so long as a suitable CAPC is used for data traf\ufb01c. In uplink transmission, LAA eNB determines the CAPC of the traf\ufb01c by consid- ering the QCI with the least priority in a Logical Channel Group. Similarly to LAA, Wi-Fi classi\ufb01es traf\ufb01c into Access Cat- egories (ACs) depending on the type of traf\ufb01c and priority. Wi-Fi (802[dot]11ac) ACs for various types of traf\ufb01c viz, video, voice, background data, and best-effort data, with the corre- sponding values for parameters viz, Arbitration Inter-frame Spacing (AIFS), CWMax, CWMin, and TXOP are presented in Table 2.  C. CHANNEL ACCESS MECHANISMS  LTE-LAA employs a Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) mechanism to access the unlicensed channel. The mechanism resembles the Carrier-sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CD) MAC protocol of Wi-Fi. LBT facilitates a better coexistence of LAA with Wi-Fi than LTE-Unlicensed (LTE- U), which has a duty-cycle mechanism [27]. LAA eNB and UEs sense the channel prior to transmitting on the LAA SCell. The LAA eNB/UE LAA will defer for an initial CCA duration depending on the CAPC of the traf\ufb01c. Subsequently, LBT triggers a random back-off period in the range of (0, CWsize), where CWsize is assigned a value between CWMin and CWMax according to channel conditions. If the back-off is successful, the LAA eNB/UE starts transmitting. Wi-Fi makes use of the CSMA/CD mechanism, which ensures that an AP/device transmits only when the channel is idle and the station has not \ufb01nished a successful transmis- sion immediately prior to sensing the channel. The device waits for an initial sensing period of Distributed Coordination Function Inter-frame Space (DIFS) for IEEE 802[dot]11n and below, or AIFS for amendment 11ac and above. If the Wi-Fi node is contending for access immediately after a successful transmission, it continues to sense the channel for an initial length of DIFS/AIFS, until the channel is idle again. If the channel is detected to be busy, a random back-off period in the range of (0, CWsize) is selected. LAA\u2019s LBT is compatible with CSMA/CD of Wi-Fi, which reduces collisions during transmissions and leads to fair coex- istence and enhanced network performance [28]. Further- more, Wi-Fi has an energy threshold of \u221262 dBm and a preamble detection threshold of \u221282 dBm. Since the LAA LBT has an energy threshold of \u221272 dBm, its vulnerability to interference from Wi-Fi APs is reduced, which also facilitates fewer \ufb02uctuations in signal strength at the LAA UE. Finally, upon getting access to the channel, an LAA eNB/UE can transmit data for a TXOP length of up to 10 ms if it has prior information that a Wi-Fi device does not coexist in the unlicensed band. However, onsite measurements reveal that for most types of traf\ufb01c (for example data, data plus video/streaming, etc) LAA LBT generally allows for a maximum TXOP of 8 ms to the UE for transmission.  VI. DATA GATHERING AND EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS  Having discussed the new-found phenomenon and the tech- nical aspects relevant to the analysis, this section describes the data gathering exercise, followed by data distribution analysis.  A. OPERATOR DATA COLLECTION AND EXTRACTION  Real-time LAA network data for three operators, viz, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon is gathered from downtown Chicago, as depicted in Figure 5(a), through the Network Signal Guru (NSG) app [29]. NSG is a subscription-based application developed and released by Qtrun Technologies. It offers detailed and precise information on network parameters such  87288 VOLUME 10, 2022",

A section of NSG\u2019s user interface is shown in Figure 5(b). It supports a wide variety of cellular standards (for example LTE, LAA, 5G, etc) and provides more accu- rate and detailed information than other applications such as SigCap or FCC Speed Test. Unfortunately, NSG only permits monitoring the data and does not allow extraction for analysis in a suitable format such as \u2018\u2018.CSV\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018.txt\u2019\u2019. Thus, operator data extraction involved a complex process that required screen-capturing NSG interface into a video and then processing it through computer vision techniques followed by a deep-learning-based OCR engine. The video-to-text extraction process presented several challenges, some of which are shown in Figure 5(b), with the aid of numbered labels. First, the screen refreshes at intervals that are hard to predict, and the interface scrolls back to the top. This makes screen-capturing speci\ufb01c \ufb01elds with perfect alignment for the computer vision (CV) and OCR pipeline extremely tedious. Second, values of the same metric (for example Throughput) are in different colors and need to be processed through different CV and OCR techniques for high accuracy. Third, elements in the UI mask portions of the values to be extracted, adversely impacting text recognition accuracy.  Fourth, some \ufb01elds/parameters have a compact placement, requiring additional steps in the image processing pipeline. Fifth, not all the \ufb01elds are populated, which makes mapping of corresponding \ufb01elds (for example Throughput with SINR) a non- trivial task. Finally, varying colors and extent of the back- grounds of \ufb01elds (for example SINR) degrades recognition accuracy especially when dealing with negative values and, therefore, need a specially designed image processing pipeline. Our engineering solution solved these problems and close to 7500 samples were successfully extracted and analyzed in this work.  B. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 1) SAMPLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION The PCI-speci\ufb01c distribution1 of extracted samples in the Same PCI and Different PCI scenarios, for Licensed and Unlicensed components is presented in Figure 6. As dis- cussed earlier, Same PCI has a much higher proportion of samples in both LTE and LAA components. However, there is another dimension to this imbalance. Since the Differ- ent PCI LAA sites are less in number, the probability of  1Due to a large number of PCIs, only those with signi\ufb01cant sample-sizes are displayed here.  VOLUME 10, 2022 87289",

Consequently, the samples are also concentrated within a few small cells, leading to an internal pattern imbalance in the feature set of the Different PCI sample space. These challenges add complexity to the intended objective of accurately identifying PCI scenarios, through imbalanced classi\ufb01cation with a small feature set.  2) DENSITY DISTRIBUTION The cumulative distribution plots of Throughput and SINR values in the operator data are presented in Figures 7(a) & 7(b), respectively. Both distributions exhibit the impact of the coexistence component and the PCI scenario within the component. Beginning with component-speci\ufb01c analysis, for more than 85% Different PCI Throughput samples, the Unli- censed component has a lower magnitude, but this trend reverses for the last 15% samples. Consequently, 80% users in the Unlicensed Different PCI environment are likely to receive 10 Mbps less Throughout than Licensed Different PCI users. In contrast, Licensed Same PCI performs worse than Unlicensed Different PCI, for 80% users, but the performance of both is comparable for 20% users in the Throughput range of 45 Mbps\u201363 Mbps. The SINR trend for Licensed and Unlicensed Different PCI conforms to the Throughput trend. However, the SINR trend for the Same PCI does not corre- spond to the Throughput trend in entirety, and Unlicensed performance remains better than Licensed throughout. This shows a clear impact of PCI con\ufb01gurations on the perfor- mance of unlicensed network components. The allocation of radio resources and their availability play a key role in network performance. There seems to be better resource allo- cation in Licensed Same PCI that enables it to match up to Unlicensed Same PCI, despite lower SINR. A PCI scenario-speci\ufb01c analysis also highlights a differ- ence in resource allocation in the two scenarios. For example, Licensed Same PCI performs better than Licensed Differ- ent PCI in terms of Throughput, in 50% samples where Throughput is higher than 35 Mbps. However, the cumula- tive Licensed Same PCI SINR distribution remains consis- tently higher than the Licensed Different PCI SINR. This  indicates that the variation in Throughput is a result of other network-related factors that differ in the two scenarios. In the Unlicensed component, the Same PCI Throughput is always better than the Different PCI Throughput. This is despite the fact that the cumulative distribution of Unlicensed SINR is not always better in Same PCI, and Different PCI performs better at higher SINRs (\u227321[dot]5 dBm). Overall, both Licensed and Unlicensed Same PCI network capacity seems to be better than the corresponding Different PCI. This could be attributed to more ef\ufb01cient cell selection and backhaul.  VII. NETWORK PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  The objective of the analysis presented in this section is to infer how network performance in the Licensed and Unli- censed components of the coexistence system varies in each PCI scenario. The discussion seeks to (a) highlight the rele- vance of PCI scenario-speci\ufb01c network analysis, (b) investi- gate the impact of PCI scenarios on the network performance in Licensed and Unlicensed components, and (c) examine the performance of data reduction techniques in both scenarios.  A. METHODOLOGY AND TECHNIQUES 1) METHODOLOGY To study the variation in network performance in the two PCI scenarios, a data-driven approach leveraging machine learning algorithms is ideal [30], [31]. Thus, the prediction of network performance is done using feature relationship modeling. Operator data is subjected to eight supervised machine learning algorithms to determine the relationship between network feature points of primary importance, viz, Signal and Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR), network throughput (Capacity), and cell-allocation (PCI). It is a good practice to employ a broad set of machine learning algorithms consisting of different types for example deterministic and stochas- tic, to ensure a robust coexistence performance prediction and feature relationship analysis through cross-veri\ufb01cation of results. Further, for both PCI scenarios, that is Same PCI and Different PCI, a \ufb01ne-grained SINR-Capacity feature relation- ship analysis is presented by comparing models that consider  87290 VOLUME 10, 2022",

      "text": "S.M. Kala et al: Identification and Analysis of a Unique Cell Selection Phenomenon  PCI as a categorical parameter (With PCI) with models that do not consider PCI as a categorical parameter (Without PCI). Since the analysis of the combined coexistence network data is shown to obfuscate the \ufb01ndings [10], [11], operator data is segregated into its Licensed and Unlicensed compo- nents. Finally, the R-sq of a model re\ufb02ects the strength of the relationship between the network feature points. In this work, a multivariate relationship analysis is performed to determine the explanability of network throughput. Thus, the model R-sq is denoted as \u2018\u2018ThroughputExp\u2019\u2019 in this work. ThroughputExp serves as a metric for a comparative analysis of network performance prediction and feature rela- tionship strength. A higher ThroughputExp implies a strong feature relationship and consequently a greater con\ufb01dence in the model to predict the response variable, that is network throughput.  2) MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS Let N be the number of training points and D be the dimen- sionality of the feature vector. Then the LTE-LAA network data can be represented as {xi, yi}N i=1, where xi \u2208RD is the feature vector and yi \u2208R is the ground truth value for the ith training point. The objective is to learn a mapping f : xi \u2192yi where xi is the feature vector constructed using Signal & Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) and cell-allocation (PCI) and yi is the target value, that is network throughput (Capacity). A diverse set of regression algorithms are considered, which are discussed below: (i) Linear Regression: This family of algorithms [32] aims to learn a linear mapping by solving, arg minw,b PN i=1 ||(w\u22a4xi +b)\u2212yi||2 2 +\u03b1w\u22a4w. Here, w \u2208RD  is the weight vector and b \u2208R is the bias term. Moreover, \u03b1 is a hyperparameter used to control the importance/weightage of the l2-regularization term. \u03b1 is set as zero in the case of Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression (OLS), whereas it is set via k-fold cross-validation (kCV) in the case of Ridge Regression (RR). (ii) Kernel Regression: Kernel Ridge Regression algo- rithms [32] learn a non-linear mapping through a kernel func- tion K(a, b). The goal is to solve arg minw,b PN i=1 ||K(w, xi)+ b \u2212yi||2 2 + \u03b1w\u22a4w. Here, w \u2208RD is the weight vector, b \u2208R is the bias term, and \u03b1 is a hyperparameter as de\ufb01ned earlier. Varying the kernel function as Radial Basic Function and Polynomial leads to Kernel RBF Regression (RBF) and Multi-variate Polynomial Regression (MPR), respectively. We considered 2\u20134 degree polynomials in MPR and the optimal degree was chosen based on the value of R-sq via kCV. (iii) Neural networks (NN): This family of algorithms learns a non-linear mapping via a sequence of feed-forward layers in contrast to hand-crafted kernel functions used by Kernel Ridge Regression [32]. A wide range of neural net- works were considered with 1\u20132 hidden layers, 5\u201350 neurons per hidden layer, and ReLU, logistic & Tanh activation func- tions. The optimal con\ufb01guration and hyperparameters were chosen on the basis of the R-sq metric via kCV.  (iv) Decision Tree Regressor: Decision Trees (DT) recur- sively partition the data points to minimize the mean squared error at each node [32]. We experimented with trees of depth 5\u201320 and the optimal depth was determined via kCV. The Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning algorithm was imple- mented to prune the learned tree and avoid over\ufb01tting [32]. Ensembles with 3\u2013100 base learners were considered, and the optimal number was determined by kCV. In particular, an ensemble of 25 decision tree regressors yielded the best R-sq value for both Random Forest Regressor (RF) and Gra- dient Boosting (GB) in the experiments.  B. PCI SCENARIOS AND LTE-LAA PERFORMANCE  SINR-Capacity feature relationship analysis is performed on LTE-LAA operator data. It is worth mentioning that for Licensed and Unlicensed, 18[dot]61% and 16[dot]04% data belongs to the Same PCI scenario, respectively. The rest falls under the Different PCI scenario. Linear algorithms (Linear and Ridge Regression), generate models with lower ThroughputExp than non-linear algorithms (remaining six algorithms). The latter seem to be more suited to \ufb01t the SINR-Capacity (and PCI) data which is also considered to be non-linear [10], [11]. However, the trend of predictive performance is fairly consistent across all algorithms. Hence, the discussion ahead focuses on network feature relationship patterns as a whole and not on the results of individual algorithms. The results of data analysis are distilled in the form of inferences presented below along with the explanations. (i) Component and PCI scenario speci\ufb01c data segre- gation seems to be a pre-condition for accurate coexis- tence network performance prediction. Although the need for component-speci\ufb01c data segregation has been highlighted earlier [10], [11], for reliable modeling of feature relation- ships, component-speci\ufb01c data segregation alone is not suf- \ufb01cient. Figure 8(a), presents the relationship analysis for data segregated based on LTE-LAA network components, with and without PCI as categorical parameter. It shows that the SINR-Capacity ThroughputExp for Licensed data models is always lower than the corresponding Unlicensed models. However, it will be demonstrated ahead that this is not the case. Similarly, segregating data based on PCI scenario alone does not yield an accurate network performance prediction. For example, Figure 8(b), shows that the ThroughputExp of Same PCI models is invariably lower than that of the different PCI models. Again, we now know that this is not true. Thus, for reliable network prediction models, coexis- tence network data should be segregated based on both net- work component (Licensed/Unlicensed) and PCI scenario (Same/Different). (ii) Current LAA deployment architecture may not facili- tate ef\ufb01cient Licensed operation in both PCI scenarios. It is evident from Figure 9(a), that Licensed Same PCI model ThroughputExp is signi\ufb01cantly higher than the correspond- ing Different PCI model ThroughputExp. This implies that predicting network performance (for example network capacity) is  VOLUME 10, 2022 87291",

FIGURE 9. LAA PCI scenarios and network performance prediction.  more reliable in the former case. The trend holds for all regression and learning algorithms, regardless of whether PCI is considered a categorical parameter. However, with- out PCI as a categorical parameter, the difference in the model ThroughputExp for the two scenarios is exaggerated (109[dot]72% on average) compared to when PCI is a categor- ical parameter (65[dot]52% on average). Thus, the \u2018\u2018Without PCI\u2019\u2019 modeling should be avoided for a reliable repre- sentation of the feature relationships. The more important inference is that for the Licensed component, feature rela- tionships are rather poor in the Different PCI scenario. This implies that network performance cannot be predicted with con\ufb01dence. Thus, the current coexistence deployment architecture appears to be creating performance bottlenecks in the Differ- ent PCI con\ufb01guration and may not facilitate optimal network performance in the Licensed component. (iii) Current LAA deployment architecture favors Unli- censed operation. ThroughputExp of Unlicensed models demonstrates a trend exactly opposite to that observed in the Licensed component. Different PCI scenario models,  across all machine learning algorithms, perform better than Same PCI scenarios. Further, there are three more points of difference when compared to the Licensed performance prediction patterns. First, the difference in ThroughputExp for the two Unlicensed PCI scenarios is not as pronounced as it was in the Licensed (only 14[dot]68% on average for \u2018\u2018With PCI\u2019\u2019). Second, the absolute magnitude of ThroughputExp for Unlicensed models, for both Same and Different PCI scenarios, is much higher than that of Licensed models. For example, the average Different PCI ThroughputExp for \u2018\u2018With PCI\u2019\u2019 models is 37[dot]39 for Licensed and 93[dot]31 for Unlicensed. Third, not using PCI as a categorical parameter does not affect the relative difference in model ThroughputExp for the two PCI scenarios unlike Licensed models, although the absolute values decrease as expected in the case of \u2018\u2018Without PCI\u2019\u2019 [10], [11]. The main takeaway is that the network feature relationships and performance prediction in the Unlicensed component are largely consistent in both PCI scenarios. This implies that the LTE-LAA site architecture leads to a relatively more ef\ufb01cient Unlicensed operation.  87292 VOLUME 10, 2022",

Cell-specific numerosity reduction for unlicensed PCIs.  C. PCI SCENARIOS AND NUMEROSITY REDUCTION  Numerosity reduction is a crucial tool for reducing the com- putational overhead of network data-driven cell selection and handover [33]. Sampling and clustering are two popu- lar approaches to numerosity reduction [31]. The ef\ufb01ciency of these techniques depends on the selection of a smaller sample that resembles the characteristics and distribution of the original dataset. However, the nature and distribution of the data may vary in the two PCI scenarios, thus affecting the performance of the numerosity reduction techniques. This problem is investigated by observing the perfor- mance of two nonparametric techniques viz, Random Sam- pling and k-mediods Clustering, validated through kCV, for k=5 [31], [33].  1) MACRO LEVEL ANALYSIS It can be discerned from Figures 10 (a) & 10 (b), that for both Licensed and Unlicensed, for all subsets of the original dataset, the ThroughputExp trends are as observed earlier. Further, Random Sampling seems to be a better numerosity reduction technique than k-mediods Clustering, for both PCI scenarios in both the coexistence components. Two differ- ences are evident between the PCI scenarios. First, the Dif- ferent PCI dataset is less than one-fourth of the Same PCI, which implies that as the reduced dataset gets smaller, the ability to predict the response variable will decrease at a faster rate in the Different PCI models than in the Same PCI models. For example, consider the average decrease in ThroughputExp for randomly sampled models in the Unlicensed component,  VOLUME 10, 2022 87293",

    },
    {
      "text": "S.M. Kala et al: Identification and Analysis of a Unique Cell Selection Phenomenon  for both scenarios. In the Same PCI scenario, for data subsets ranging from 30% to 10% size of the original, the average decrease is six times that of subsets ranging from 100% to 30% of the original. In Different PCI, a similar comparison yields an 18-fold gap. Thus, for the Different PCI scenario, numerosity reduction techniques should be applied only if the original dataset has a large number of sample points. Sec- ond, PCI scenarios respond differently to the data reduction algorithms. The performance of both sampling and clustering on Same PCI data is consistent up to a 10% fraction of the original dataset for both Licensed and Unlicensed. However, for the Different PCI scenario, k-mediods Clustering does not seem to be a good choice. For Licensed, the Different PCI clustering models show negative ThroughputExp 60% fraction onward, while for Unlicensed, the ThroughputExp is negative after the 25% fraction. This occurrence cannot be attributed to a smaller sample space of Different PCI data as Random Sampling performs signi\ufb01cantly better for subsets of identical sizes, and the model ThroughputExp is never negative even in the 10% subset.  2) PCI LEVEL MICRO ANALYSIS At the level of individual PCIs, the impact of numerosity reduction techniques becomes more visible. Data from three different cells, with a low, medium, and large number of samples, is subjected to Clustering and Random Sampling. The results are presented in Figures 11(a), (b) and (c) for the Same PCI cells, and Figures 11(d), (e) and (f) for the Different PCI cells. Random Sampling seems to perform better, since at each stage the selected samples are more evenly distributed. When the data distribution is dispersed, as in Same PCI 038, Figure 11(a), both the algorithms yield similar results after distribution. Else, Clustering tends to capture only a subset of the overall distribution, especially for Different PCI. This changes the characteristics of the reduced sample vis-\u00e0-vis the baseline sample, leading to poor prediction performance. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that k-mediods Clustering should be avoided in the Different PCI scenario. This is an interesting \ufb01nding, as clustering algorithms are often used during the preprocessing phase of cell allocation and cate- gorization [31]. It is worth noting that while the Same PCI scenario seems unaffected by the choice of data reduction approach, our evaluation is limited to two popular techniques, and a wider set of algorithms may yield a different view. More sophisticated algorithms including local density-based instance selection (LDIS) [34] can also be implemented. However, random sampling and k-mediods Clustering were chosen because an instance pruning algorithm should have a minimal computational footprint to ensure optimal per- formance in the downstream task (for example learning a mapping between SINR and Throughput). A detailed discussion and analysis of popular instance pruning algorithms can be found in [35] and [34]. Nevertheless, it can be inferred from the \ufb01ndings that the PCI scenario in\ufb02uences the choice of numerosity reduction technique.  FIGURE 12. Illustration of the on-site experiment setup.  VIII. ON-SITE EXPERIMENTS, RESULTS, AND ANALYSIS  Next, a measurement-based analysis of real-time network performance is carried out for the two PCI scenarios. The onsite experiments and measurements involve several chal- lenges, such as the identi\ufb01cation of the two PCI sce- narios in operator deployments, and creating a controlled LTE-WiFi coexistence environment. Where applicable, infer- ences drawn from operator data analysis are compared with measurement-based observations.  A. EXPERIMENT SETUP AND SITE SELECTION  An increasingly large number of Release 13 compliant LAA Base Stations (BS) are being deployed in downtown Chicago. Further, up to three Wi-Fi channels can be aggregated by an LAA BS in the U-NII 1 band (Channels 36, 40, & 44) or the U-NII 3 band (Channels 149, 153, & 157). It is capable of 2\u00d72 MIMO transmissions with a maximum modulation coding scheme (MCS) of 256 QAM. Consequently, PCI scenario-speci\ufb01c site determination is a challenging task. The \ufb01rst step involves identifying the sites where the LAA & LTE BS are mounted on the same pole (Same PCI) and where the LAA & LTE BS are mounted on different poles (Different PCI), as shown in Figure 12. This is done using the NSG app, by monitoring the PCI assigned to the LTE and LAA components. Thereafter, the signal strengths (for example SINR and RSRP) are monitored and compared to verify the sources.  B. METHODOLOGY  The variation in real-time network performance in the two PCI scenarios is observed and compared to the \ufb01ndings of the data analysis. The traf\ufb01c type and the LTE-WiFi coexistence environment are varied for a comprehensive evaluation of the impact on network performance. NSG app, with root permission, was used to observe performance metrics such as SINR, Throughput, Resource Block (RB) allocation for each channel, TXOP, etc The observations were made at 15 minute intervals (on ground, not point-to-point) up to a distance of 150m from the LAA small cell.  87294 VOLUME 10, 2022",

Unlicensed on-site measurements.  1) TRAFFIC TYPES AND QUALITY OF SERVICE Several realistic traf\ufb01c scenarios are considered, as LAA categorizes different types of data traf\ufb01c into different access classes. Further, the Listen Before Talk (LBT) mechanism prescribes different duration of transmission opportunity (TXOP) to different traf\ufb01c access classes, presented in Table 1. For example, background data (Access Class = 4) is offered a TXOP of 8ms, the maximum for any type of traf\ufb01c, to maximize network capacity. Likewise, Wi-Fi de\ufb01nes spe- ci\ufb01c access categories for different types of traf\ufb01c, presented in Table 2. The Wi-Fi TXOP duration is smaller (2[dot]528ms for background data), which implies that LAA can occupy the transmission channel for a longer duration on average. Most importantly, categorizing traf\ufb01c is vital to meet QoS guarantees and is done through a QoS Class Identi\ufb01er (QCI) which assigns a maximum packet delay threshold to each traf- \ufb01c class. The permitted delay determines which component (Licensed or Unlicensed) the traf\ufb01c pipeline will be assigned to.

It was also veri\ufb01ed (using NSG) that more than  95% of the available LAA RBs were allocated to the LAA client device. This can be attributed to fewer active users due to COVID-19, and availability of a limited number of LAA devices in the market which are also quite expensive. These factors helped us create a controlled coexistence envi- ronment. Measurements for Same PCI and Different PCI scenarios in Licensed and Unlicensed components were done with one active Wi-Fi hotspot to ensure true LTE-WiFi coex- istence. Thereafter, different coexistence scenarios were cre- ated by incrementally introducing up to \ufb01ve mobile Wi-Fi hotspots. All Wi-Fi hotspots were operational on the same channel as LAA. Ten mobile devices including Google Pixel (2, 3, & 5), Motorola Edge+, and Samsung Galaxy S9 were used; \ufb01ve to create Wi-Fi hotspots and the remaining \ufb01ve to act as clients. A Google Pixel 5 served as the LTE-LAA client. For maximal impact, a dense network scenario was created with all Wi-Fi hotspots within a 10m range of each other and the target UE.  C. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 1) UNLICENSED COMPONENT The variation in Throughput with distance for \ufb01ve types of traf\ufb01c and one coexisting Wi-Fi hotspot is shown in Figures 13(a) & 13(b). It is evident that the network perfor- mance in the Same PCI scenario far exceeds that in the Dif- ferent PCI scenario (by 76[dot]93% on average for background data). As expected, the Throughput for all types of traf\ufb01c decreases with distance, due to the corresponding decrease in SINR. Likewise, with the incremental introduction of Wi-Fi hotspots (that is Co-channel interference), the network Throughput consistently decreases, which is evident from  VOLUME 10, 2022 87295",

The following \ufb01ndings are noteworthy.  \u2022 Correlating ThroughputExp with network performance: Although the ThroughputExp of SINR-Capacity model for the Different PCI scenarios are higher than those of the Same PCI, the reverse is true for performance in terms of actual network Throughput. This cannot be attributed to a variation in SINR, which is comparable for both scenarios. From a network monitoring stand- point, it can be discerned from Figure 13(e) that RB allocation for data download and video streaming in Same PCI is higher than the corresponding Different PCI functions by 65[dot]19% and 98[dot]63%, respectively. With similar levels of SINR, a higher RB allocation explains the greater Throughput in Same PCI despite low model ThroughputExp. However, from a data analysis perspec- tive, the opposing trends imply that in Same PCI sce- narios network variables other than SINR, Capacity, and PCI (for example RB allocated, QCI, etc) play a more signif- icant role in network model. Including these variables in the prediction of network performance may offer trends consistent with measurement analysis [10], [11]. They may also yield more robust network models with higher ThroughputExp and reliable feature relationship equations for use in network optimization [10], [37]. However, adding more network features will increase the computational overhead of training ML models.  \u2022 Impact of coexisting Wi-Fi APs: Figure 13(f) shows that increasing the coexisting Wi-Fi hotspots from one to \ufb01ve not only degrades the SINR due to increased interfer- ence, but also reduces the RB allocation due to increased contention for channel access.  2) LICENSED COMPONENT Throughput and RB allocation results for the Licensed on-site experiments are presented in Figures 14(a) & 14(b), respec- tively. The Same PCI and Different PCI performance trends in the Licensed component are similar for both operator data  analysis and network experiments. The Same PCI scenario outperforms the Different PCI, in terms of network perfor- mance prediction, network throughput, and RB allocation, for comparable levels of SINR. Compared to the Same PCI scenarios, the network performance drop (for example Throughput & RB) in Different PCI conforms to the signi\ufb01cantly lower model ThroughputExp. As inferred earlier from the data anal- ysis, Licensed operation in the current LTE-LAA deploy- ments is not ef\ufb01cient in the Different PCI scenario.  3) PCI SCENARIOS AND QoS An insightful observation on the LTE-LAA operation can be made by monitoring network performance metrics when Live Stream traf\ufb01c is active. It can be discerned from Figure 13 that the Unlicensed component does not register any Throughput for Live Stream, in both Same PCI and Different PCI sce- narios. Likewise, in both the Unlicensed scenarios, no RB is allocated to Live Stream. Live Stream falls in QCI class 7, along with other delay critical and data-intensive services as online interactive gam- ing. The maximum permitted Packet Delay and Packet Loss Rate for QCI 7 are 100ms and 10\u22123, respectively. Live stream traf\ufb01c is not assigned to the LAA component despite high RB availability and little contention from coexisting Wi-Fi APs, as the cellular operator cannot guarantee the QoS requirements in the Unlicensed spectrum. Consequently, as illustrated in Figure 14, the Licensed LTE component carries Live Stream traf\ufb01c, for both Same PCI and different PCI scenarios. Thus, with respect to QoS guarantees, PCI Scenarios do not seem to have any bearing on the operator decision of assigning particular traf\ufb01c pipelines to LTE or LAA interfaces.  4) RESOURCE BLOCKS AND LTE-LAA PERFORMANCE A detailed comparison of Licensed and Unlicensed feature relationships is presented in [10] and [11]. However, the feature combination is limited to SINR, Capacity, and PCI. Measurement results reveal that RB allocation may signi\ufb01- cantly in\ufb02uence feature relationships and enhance network  87296 VOLUME 10, 2022",

In general, the Same PCI RB alloca- tion is higher than Different PCI. However, this difference is more pronounced in the Licensed spectrum as compared to the Unlicensed. Further, despite the factors of resource shar- ing, contention, and back-off mechanisms in the Unlicensed spectrum, the observed RB allocation is much higher than the Licensed. This is because three 20MHz channels are available in the Unlicensed spectrum, leading up to a maximal RB allocation of 300. However, as user density increases, high availability of resource blocks may not be possible. Finally, Figure 13(e) shows that the RB allocation in the Unlicensed spectrum is adversely affected by distance, while there seems to be no evident pattern in the Licensed spectrum, as seen in Figure 14(b). However, the existence of a correlation can only be ascertained through feature relationship analysis.  5) IMPACT ON WI-FI PERFORMANCE In this experiment, Wi-Fi AP 802[dot]11 ac is made to coexist with LAA BS for the \ufb01ve different traf\ufb01c \ufb02ows. The closed authentication method is used so that outside Wi-Fi clients are not connected to the AP. The Wi-Fi performance is measured using Wireshark, which runs on a laptop in monitor mode so that it can capture all packets in the air corresponding to the locked channel. The Throughput and Latency for Wi-Fi base- line and coexistence scenarios is computed, and the results are presented in Figures 15(a) & 15(b). Wi-Fi performance is better for both scenarios when there is no LAA transmission. Upon activating LAA clients and initiating data traf\ufb01c, it was observed that there is an immense adverse impact on Wi-Fi performance. While Throughput drops to half as compared to the baseline scenario, Latency increases by as much as four times for most traf\ufb01c \ufb02ows. Between Same PCI and Different PCI, the latter seems to coexist better with Wi-Fi, offering relatively better performance than the Same PCI scenario. This conforms to the LAA-side observations, as a better performance of Same PCI LAA, leads to greater contention with Wi-Fi, degrading Throughput, and increasing Latency, more than the Different PCI LAA.  The on-site experiments at LAA sites demonstrate the impact of coexistence PCI scenarios on both LAA and Wi-Fi sub-systems. The next section attempts to solve the important problem of recognizing the PCI scenario by analyzing the operator data.  IX. PREDICTIVE MODELING OF PCI SCENARIOS  Unlicensed network performance is in\ufb02uenced by the PCI scenario to which a UE belongs. Thus, awareness of PCI scenarios at the UE will be instrumental in implementing UE-initiated cellular operations such as cell selection, han- dover, broadcasts, etc [38], [39]. A reliable solution will also be bene\ufb01cial during vertical handovers in emerging 5G heterogeneous networks [40]. Thus, identi\ufb01cation of the PCI Scenario at the UE will further improve its decision making process while performing these operations for enhanced end- user QoS. However, there are two factors that make this task extremely challenging. First, there is the problem of power costs in UE-driven procedures, because battery drain is a major constraint in mobile devices. UE-driven cell selec- tion and handover mechanisms must be light-weight with low power costs to avoid battery drain [38]. Traditionally, advanced power saving mechanisms, such as \u2018\u2018sleep modes\u2019\u2019 are implemented to reduce battery drain [39]. Since the PCI Scenario identi\ufb01cation requires ML based classi\ufb01ca- tion models that are inherently computationally expensive, the simplest feature vector conceivable in a wireless net- work comprising only SINR and throughput is considered in the proposed solution. The rationale being that cell selec- tion mechanisms in LTE/LTE-A/LAA rely heavily on some measure of signal strength such as SINR or RSRP [15]. Furthermore, from the perspective of QoS guarantees, net- work throughput is the metric of primary interest. Learning the PCI scenario from a simple two-variable feature vec- tor is particularly useful as it minimizes the energy budget of the computational requirements for classi\ufb01cation, espe- cially if it is being performed on a mobile device. How- ever, it signi\ufb01cantly increases the dif\ufb01culty in achieving high  VOLUME 10, 2022 87297",

Decision boundaries.  prediction accuracy, an obstacle that the proposed solution overcomes. Second, the inherent imbalance in the PCI scenario dis- tribution (>80% LAA sites are Same PCI), is re\ufb02ected in the network data, rendering the minority class to be a mere 16% in our data set. Together, the minimalist feature vector and extreme data imbalance make PCI scenario detection a dif\ufb01cult problem to solve.  A. PROBLEM SETUP  The identi\ufb01cation of two PCI scenarios, that is Same or Differ- ent can be posed as a binary classi\ufb01cation problem. In partic- ular, the task is to learn a mapping h : xi \u2212 \u2192ti, where xi is the feature vector with attributes SINR (dBm) & Throughput (Mbps). Further, ti is 1 when the data point belongs to the Same PCI scenario and 0, otherwise.  B. LEARNING THE DECISION FUNCTION (H)  The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was deployed to learn h. In principle, other machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees, can also be used with varying trade-offs in accuracy and compute time. Suppose that the data set has N training points, that is {(xi, ti)}N i=1, then the SVM algorithm aims to solve the following optimization problem:  arg minw,b 1 2w\u22a4w + C  N X  i=1 \u03b6i  s.t. ti(w\u22a4\u03c6(xi) + b) \u22651 \u2212\u03b6i, \u2200i \u03b6i \u22650, \u2200i (1)  where w and b are the weight vector and bias, respectively. C is a hyperparameter that is set through cross-validation.  Moreover, \u03c6 is a function that allows us to learn non-linear boundaries. Figure 16 indicates that the data is not linearly separable. Thus, a non-linear decision function could help us make more accurate predictions as compared to a linear decision function. In Figure 16, the decision boundaries for both Unlicensed and Licensed data are presented. In the \ufb01gure, \u2018orange\u2019 points refer to points belonging to the Same PCI scenario, whereas \u2018navy\u2019 points signify the Different PCI scenario. The SVM algorithm was used with the RBF kernel to learn the decision boundaries. The variation of Macro f-scores for the task of PCI sce- nario classi\ufb01cations with different kernel functions used by the SVM algorithm is presented in Table 3. The scores are computed via k-fold cross validation, where k = 5. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) yields the best accuracy in both settings.  C. DATA IMBALANCE  Data analysis reveals that the data is imbalanced in favor of the Same PCI scenario \u2013 83[dot]51% data points are from the Same PCI scenario, whereas 16[dot]49% data points are from different PCI. It is important that a classi\ufb01cation model performs well on both classes and not just on the majority class. If this is not ensured, the Same PCI scenario will be detected with high accuracy, but a Different PCI sample may also be misjudged as Same PCI. From the perspective of UE initiated cell selection or handover, when a UE wishes to camp on a small cell with Different PCI architecture (for example to experience better Wi-Fi performance), it is very likely to erroneously camp on the Same PCI cell. Figure 17 shows that the standard classi\ufb01er performs well only on the majority class. Therefore, it becomes crucial to explicitly handle the issue of data imbalance. Popular approaches handle data imbalance by introducing class weights or by down-sampling the majority class [41]. In particular, we used the inverse fre- quency as the class weight for both Unlicenced and Licenced data. In practice, class weights can be readily incorporated in to eq. 1. The class-imbalance requires us to adapt the evalu- ation metric in addition to the training pipeline as discussed below.  D. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  A trivial algorithm that always predicts the majority class can lead to 83[dot]51% accuracy on the classi\ufb01cation task. Note that, the accuracy is de\ufb01ned as the percentage of points that were correctly classi\ufb01ed by the model. However, such a model would be clearly undesirable, as it does well only on the majority class. Hence, it becomes important to look at f-score, confusion matrix, and receiver operating char- acteristic (ROC) curve for an exhaustive evaluation of the classi\ufb01cation model. The confusion matrices in Figure 17 demonstrate that class weights allow for more balanced predictions on both classes, compared to the standard classi\ufb01er. Learning a classi\ufb01er with class weights (second row) leads to accu- rate predictions on both classes, whereas the standard  87298 VOLUME 10, 2022",

In par- ticular, the unweighted predictor yields 100% and 96% accuracy for the same PCI class for Licenced and Unli- cenced data, respectively. However, the accuracy drops down to 0% and 50% on the Different PCI class for Licenced and Unlicenced data, respectively. On the other hand, the weighted predictor yields 82% and 74% accuracies on the Different PCI class for Licenced and Unlicenced data, respectively  Moreover, the ROC curve in Fig. 18 presents the relation- ship between True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR). Getting high TPR might be more important for certain applications, whereas a low FPR might be more important for others. So, the end-user may choose the con- \ufb01guration depending on the application based on the ROC curve. For example, when a user is mobile and needs higher performance in the Unlicensed spectrum by camping on a Same PCI cell, it is highly desirable to have a high TPR. Likewise, in an indoor setting, where the user needs higher Wi-Fi bandwidth for traf\ufb01c such as Live-streams, it may be important to ensure a low FPR, for reliable identi\ufb01cation of Different PCI Scenario. At times ensuring both high TPR and low FPR may also be necessary for latency-critical services such as augmented reality applications on the Licensed/Unlicensed component or live-streams on the Licensed component. The proposed PCI scenario classi\ufb01cation solution is highly suitable for UE-driven procedures, especially in Unli- censed networks where its prediction performance is high (AUC=0[dot]84). It is worth noting that the high accuracy is despite the use of a minimal feature set comprising only SINR and Throughput. Thus, the proposed solution offers strong prediction of the PCI scenario while ensuring energy savings at the UE, which is a prerequisite for UE-initiated handovers and cell attachments [39]. We would also like to add that for UE-driven cell selection, the distinction in the performance of Same PCI and Different PCI scenarios, will raise the questions of fairness in resource allocation. In recent past, game theory approaches have been shown to be particularly useful in solving problems of fair  VOLUME 10, 2022 87299",

Thus, to decide when a UE can attach to the Same PCI or Different PCI cell, a solution from game theory may be quite effective.  X. CONCLUSION AND WAY FORWARD  Unlicensed coexistence deployments are currently in a nascent stage and the two important factors that determine network characteristics and performance are deployment architecture and \ufb01ber optic backhaul availability. From the observations made at the LAA sites and the analysis of the dataset gathered from three major LTE-LAA coexis- tence service providers, we put forward some explanations and discuss a few open challenges with regard to the PCI Scenarios. First, the Same PCI for LTE and LAA compo- nents implies that the deployment has a common backhaul connectivity, which facilitates ef\ufb01cient splitting of Licensed and Unlicensed data. In this scenario, packet aggregation is likely to be more seamless and ef\ufb01cient. Consequently, the performance at the transport layer will improve, offering improved QoS to the end-user. Second, the impact of PCI as a categorical parameter when LTE and LAA components are camped on different cells is different from the Same PCI scenario. Third, resource block allocation not only differs in the Licensed and Unlicensed spectrum, but is also different for the two PCI scenarios within the same LTE-LAA com- ponent. Finally, successfully solving the PCI scenario iden- ti\ufb01cation problem with the minimal feature set will facilitate greater choice in the UE during the cell selection or handover process. These \ufb01ndings are extremely important in light of the upcoming 5G-NR Unlicensed coexistence deployments and the allocation of additional 1200MHz of Unlicensed spectrum in the 6 GHz band by the Federal Communications Commission. Network performance measurements indicate that RB allocation is an important network feature point and con- sidering it in the feature combination may explain the con- trasting \ufb01ndings in the Unlicensed component. It may also improve the network performance modeling in both scenar- ios. We intend to extract RB data and pursue this aspect in the future.  REFERENCES  [1] V. Sathya, M.I. Rochman, and M.
