VeroE6-GFP cells were pre-treated overnight with  serial dilutions of the compounds before infection. The GFP signal was determined by high-content imaging on day 4 post-infection. All molecules have equipotent  antiviral activity against the ancestral virus and the VOCs Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. These findings are in line with the observation that the target  proteins of these antivirals (respectively the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase and the viral main protease Mpro) are highly conserved.     One and a half year after the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-  2), multiple variants have emerged. These can be harmless or slightly  beneficial for the virus, causing for example increased transmission,  virulence, or immune escape (Davies et al, 2021; Sabino et al, 2021;  Mahase, 2021). SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification was initially  considered slow when the virus was spreading in early 2020. The first  official variant, a single spike D614G mutation found in early European  lineages, was linked to more efficient transmission (Volz et al, 2021)  and rapidly spread to become the dominant viral strain worldwide. Late  2020, multiple variants emerged that spiked regional epidemics. Five  \u2018variants of concern\u2019 (VOC) have been identified (Alpha, Beta, Gamma,  Delta and Omicron). All have characteristic mutations (www[dot]ecdc[dot]eu  ropa.eu/en/covid-19/variants-concern). The spike (S) glycoprotein ap\u00ad pears especially prone to accumulate mutations (Saputri et al, 2020)  and all of the circulating VOCs have some mutations that favor evasion  from the host immune response (Khateeb et al, 2021). Numerous  spike-protein based vaccines were developed and vaccination programs  are running at full speed. However, studies of sera and emerging  real-world evidence indicate that Omicron escapes the immunity  whether from previous infection or vaccination (Cohen, 2021).   Several direct-acting antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 have been  approved or are advancing in clinical development. They can be divided  in two classes, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the Spike  protein and small molecules interfering with the viral replication ma\u00ad chinery. mAbs are administered intravenously but studies are underway  to explore intramuscular or subcutaneous administration which would  overcome the requirement of a hospital setting for dosing. (Kumar et al,  2021). Recent cell culture data indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 variant of  concern (VOC) Omicron is not susceptible to most of the approved mAbs  making it unlikely that their clinical efficacy will be maintained (Alex\u00ad ander Wilhelm et al, 2021; VanBlargan et al, 2022).  The direct-acting small-molecule SARS-CoV-2 antivirals that have  received approval or emergency use authorization do not target the  variable spike-protein but target either the conserved viral RNA-  dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or the conserved viral main prote\u00ad ase (Mpro or 3CL protease). Remdesivir, a monophosphoramidate pro\u00ad drug of the nucleoside GS-441524, originally developed to treat Ebola  virus infections, inhibits the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. It was the first anti\u00ad viral approved or authorized for emergency use to treat COVID-19 in  several countries. Remdesivir improves clinical outcomes in patients  hospitalized with moderate-to-severe disease and it prevents disease   * Corresponding author.  ** Corresponding author.

While remdesivir requires intravenous administration, an oral prodrug  of GS-441524 is being developed (Cox et al, 2021). Molnupiravir  (MK-4482 or EIDD-2801), a prodrug of the nucleoside analogue  EIDD-1931 (\u03b2-D-N4-hydroxycytidine), is another inhibitor of the viral  RdRp and was originally developed against different RNA viruses such  as influenza (Painter et al, 2021). A phase 2a clinical trial of molnu\u00ad piravir in patients with COVID-19 shows accelerated SARS-CoV-2 RNA  clearance and elimination of infectious virus (Fischer et al, 2021). This  orally bioavailable drug was recently authorized in the UK for use in  people who have mild to moderate COVID-19 and who have at least one  risk factor for developing severe illness. Also, the U.S. FDA issued an  emergency use authorization (EUA) in infected adults who are at high  risk for progression to severe COVID-19, and for whom alternative  COVID-19 treatment options are not accessible or clinically appropriate.  Another target for antiviral drugs is the viral main protease Mpro (or  3CL protease), a cysteine protease which cleaves the two polyproteins  (pp1a and pp1ab) of SARS-CoV-2 at multiple locations, resulting in the  various non-structural proteins, which are key for viral replication.  Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), is an irreversible inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2  Mpro that is co-formulated with ritonavir allowing an oral route of  administration (known as Paxlovid). When treatment is initiated during  the first days after symptom onset, it results in roughly a 90% protection  against severe COVID-19 and hospitalization (Owen et al, 2021). Even  though the Mpro-gene can be slightly affected by evolutionary muta\u00ad tions, the antiviral potency does not seem to be compromised (Sven  Ullrich et al, 2021).  We here assess the in vitro antiviral effect of GS-441524, remdesivir,  EIDD-1931, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir against the various SARS-  CoV-2 VOCs, including Omicron.  The SARS-CoV-2 antiviral assay is based on the previously estab\u00ad  lished SARS-CoV assay(Ivens et al, 2005). Upon infection the fluores\u00ad cence of VeroE6-GFP cell cultures declines due to a cytopathogenic   effect. In the presence of an antiviral compound, the cytopathogenicity  is inhibited and the fluorescent signal maintained. To this end  VeroE6-GFP cells (kindly provided by Marnix Van Loock, Janssen  Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium), were used as described previously (Do  et al, 2021; Rana Abdelnabi et al, 2021). Since VeroE6 cells show a high  efflux of some chemotypes, the antiviral assays were performed in the  presence of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux inhibitor CP-100356 (0[dot]5  \u03bcM)(Hoffman et al, 2020). A SARS-CoV-2 strain grown from the first  Belgian patient sample (GHB-03021/2020), was used as ancestral strain  as it is closely related to the prototypic Wuhan-Hu-1 2019-nCoV (Gen\u00ad Bank accession number MN908947[dot]3) (Boudewijns et al, 2020). All the  other isolates were obtained from patients in Belgium and more infor\u00ad mation can be found in GISAID (Alpha = EPI_ISL_791333; Beta = EPI_ISL_896474; Gamma = EPI_ISL_1091366; Delta = EPI_ISL_2425097;  Omicron = EPI_ISL_6794907). The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was  kept constant for the different VOC to allow comparison of the potency.  Our in vitro results show that GS-441524, remdesivir, EIDD-1931,  molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir retain their activity against all current  VOCs including Omicron (Fig. 1). The maximal change of the median  EC50s over the different VOC is for each compound < 3x (1[dot]8x for GS-  441524, 1[dot]6x for remdesivir, 2[dot]5x for the series EIDD-1931 and mol\u00ad nupiravir and 2[dot]5x for nirmatrelvir). In our experience these results are  within the normal range of measurement error. For example, the ratio  between the 95% and 5% percentile of the EC50s of GS-441524 on GHB-  03021/2020 is 2[dot]9x (n = 206; calculated using Graphpad v9[dot]2.0). So  only differences in EC50s of >3x and with statistical significance should  be considered as meaningful differences using this methodology. The  individual EC50s values of this study are available at Mendeley Data  (https://doi[dot]org/10[dot]17632/bmjc74dyjs[dot]1)[dot]  The fact that these antivirals retain their activity on the different  SARS-CoV-2 VOCs is in accordance with the observation that the target  proteins of these antivirals are highly conserved. For the RdRp there are  only two amino acid changes (P323L in all VOCs and G671S in Delta;   Fig. 1. Activity of various antivirals upon infection of VeroE6-GFP cells with different SARS-CoV-2 VOC. VeroE6-GFP cells were pre-treated overnight with serial  dilutions of the compounds. The next day, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0[dot]001 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per  cell. The number of fluorescent pixels of GFP signal, determined by high-content imaging on day 4 post-infection, was used as read-out. The percentage of inhibition  was calculated by subtracting background (number of fluorescent pixels in the untreated infected control wells) and normalizing to the untreated-uninfected control  wells (also background subtracted). The 50% effective concentration (EC50, the concentration of compound required for fifty percent recovery of cell-induced  fluorescence) was determined using logarithmic interpolation. These experiments were performed in the presence of the Pgp-inhibitor CP-100356 (0[dot]5 \u03bcM) in  order to limit compound efflux. This graph was created using Graphpad Prism 9[dot]2.0. The boxes extend from the 25th to 75th percentiles while the whiskers indicate  the minimal and maximal values. The numbers above the X-axis indicate the number of measurements for each condition. While we determined the EC50 of  remdesivir, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir on Omicron we did not determine the EC50 on all VOC for all compounds tested. Due to time constrains we only used  historical data from our database for the other VOCs and thus some of the values are depicted as \u201cND\u201d (\u201cNot Determined\u201d). For the same reason, we included EIDD-  1931 to allow comparison with molnupiravir as both compounds are intracellularly converted to the same antiviral molecule and thus have the same EC50. The  individual EC50s values of this study are available at Mendeley Data (https://doi[dot]org/10[dot]17632/bmjc74dyjs[dot]1)[dot]   L. Vangeel et al",

As these are  distant from the active site, a different susceptibility towards remdesivir  or molnupiravir is not to be expected. For the Mpro there are also two  amino acid changes described (K90R in Beta and P132H in Omicron;  position 3353 and 3395 in ORF1ab respectively). Alike for the RdRp,  these mutations are not located near the active site of the Mpro and  hence no difference in susceptibility for nirmatrelvir is expected.  These results indicate that when more VOCs arise, due to antigenic  drift, there is a high probability that they will remain sensitive towards  current (and likely also future) antivirals that do not target the spike. It is  therefore of utmost importance to develop more pan-corona antivirals as  they will be an essential armor and complement vaccines in the strategy  to control the current pandemic (Torneri et al, 2020).
