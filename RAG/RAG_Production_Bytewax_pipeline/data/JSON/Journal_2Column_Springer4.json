But technological advancements in WMNs have inadvertently spawned a plethora of network performance bottlenecks, caused primarily by the rise in prevalent interference. Con\ufb02ict Graphs are indispensable tools used to theoretically represent and estimate the interference in wireless networks. We propose a generic algorithm to generate con\ufb02ict graphs which is independent of the underlying interference model. Further, we propose the notion of radio co-location interference, which is caused and experienced by spatially co-located radios in multi-radio multi-channel WMNs. We experimentally validate the concept, and propose a new all-encompassing algorithm to create a radio co-location aware con\ufb02ict graph. Our novel con\ufb02ict graph generation algorithm is demonstrated to be signi\ufb01cantly superior and more ef\ufb01cient than the conventional approach, through theoretical inter- ference estimates and comprehensive experiments. The results of an extensive set of ns-3 simulations run on the IEEE 802[dot]11g platform strongly indicate that the radio co- location aware con\ufb02ict graphs are a marked improvement over their conventional counterparts. We also question the use of total interference degree as a reliable metric to  predict the performance of a Channel Assignment scheme in a given WMN deployment.

They have the potential to substitute, and thereby reduce the depen- dence on the wired infrastructure. In the foreseeable future, WMNs may be extensively deployed due to consistently increasing low-cost availability of the commodity IEEE 802[dot]11 off-the-shelf hardware, smooth deployment with ease of scalability, effortless recon\ufb01gurability and increased network coverage [1, 2]. The surge in their presence will be equally attributed to the tremendous increase in data com- munication rates that are being guaranteed by the IEEE 802[dot]11 and IEEE 802[dot]16 standards. WMNs also offer enhanced reliability when compared to their wired counter- parts because of the inherent redundancy in the underlying mesh topology. WMN technology, given its practical and commercial appeal, can adequately cater to the needs of a variety of network applications. These networks range from institutional and social wireless LANs, last-mile broadband Internet access, to disaster networks. Prominent wireless technologies that stand to bene\ufb01t from WMN deployments, other than the IEEE 802[dot]11 WLANs, are the IEEE 802[dot]16 Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMANs) and the next generation cellular mobile systems, including LTE-  & Srikant Manas Kala  cs12m1012@iith[dot]ac[dot]in  M.

      "text": "Advanced [3]. WMNs are also poised to form the backbone of the next-generation of integrated wireless networks, that aim to converge a plethora of technologies such as 3G/4G mobile networks, WLANs etc, onto a single communication delivery platform [4]. The mesh topology framework in a WMN facilitates multiple-hop transmissions to relay the data traf\ufb01c seam- lessly between source-destination pairs that are often beyond the transmission range of each other [5]. Thus each node in the Wireless Mesh Backbone acts as a host and as a router, forwarding packets onto the next hop. A WMN deployment can provide both, a self-contained IEEE 802[dot]11 WLAN with no connectivity to foreign networks, as well as an unre- stricted access to outside networks, through a Gateway. Several Gateways may be required if the WMN has to establish communication links with external networks. A simplistic WMN architecture is constituted of numerous mesh-routers which relay/route the data traf\ufb01c via multiple- hop transmissions, and leverage the twin WMN features of being fully wireless and having a mesh topology. The mesh- clients are the ultimate end-user devices that are serviced by mesh-routers. The mesh-routers constitute the communica- tion backbone of the WMN. Gateways exhibit operational duality by interfacing the WMN with outside networks, besides functioning as any other mesh-router within the WMN. IEEE 802[dot]11 [6] protocol standards serve as a popular link layer protocol for WMN deployment. A trivial single- gateway WMN is illustrated in Fig. 1, with mesh-routers and mesh-clients, which is the WMN model we adhere to in our  research work. We consider the availability of multiple radios speci\ufb01cally for inter mesh-router communication, and do not deal with the mesh backbone to mesh-client com- munication issues. Hereafter, mesh-routers are referred to as nodes. Initial deployments ofWMNscomprised ofa trivialsingle- radio single-channel architecture, in which all nodes were equipped with a single radio and assigned the same channel. Subsequent performance analysis of such wireless network architectures revealed that there was substantial degradation in the network performance metrics, as the size of the WMN is scaled up [7]. Single-channel deployments also adversely affect the end-to-end throughput and network capacity in IEEE 802[dot]11 WMNs [8]. A slightly enhanced architecture is that of the single-radio multi-channel WMNs. But their per- formance in active deployments has been sub-par, due to the problems of disconnectivity in the WMN topology and the delays in channel switching. In a multi-channel network, assigning different channels to single-radio nodes leads to disruption of wireless connectivity between nodes, even though they lie within the transmission range of each other. Also, dynamically switching to the most suited channel based on the network performance indices, causes a delay of the order of milliseconds [9]. This switching delay is comparable to transmission delays and requires a near-perfect time syn- chronization between the nodes, so that they are on the same channel when they need to communicate [4]. The most ef\ufb01cient and pervasive WMN architecture is the multi-radio multi-channel (MRMC) framework.   : Wireless Link  : Wired Link  G     : Gateway MR  : Mesh Router MC  : Mesh Client      MR      MR      MC     MC     MC      MC  Internet      G / MR      MR      MR      MR      MC      MC  Fig. 1 A simplistic WMN architecture  Wireless Netw  123  Author's personal copy",

      "text": "Availability of non-overlapping channels under the IEEE 802[dot]11 and IEEE 802[dot]16 standards, and cheap off-the-shelf wireless network interface cards, have propelled the deployment of MRMC WMNs. The IEEE 802[dot]11b/g/n standard utilizes the unlicensed 2[dot]4 GHz frequency band and provides three orthogonal channels centered at 25 MHz frequency spacing while the IEEE 802[dot]11a/ac standard operates in the unlicensed national information infras- tructure band (U-NII band) that ranges from 5[dot]15 to 5[dot]85 GHz [10]. The assured number of orthogonal channels range from 12 to 24, depending upon the channel band- width that is 20 or 40 MHz, and the country/region in context. Local laws and policies may restrict access to some fre- quencies of the 5 GHz band and may also mandate the use of speci\ufb01c communication technologies in the restricted spectrum. For example, in the USA, devices operating in the 5 GHz spectrum are permitted to use only a part of the spectrum, and are required to employ transmit power control and dynamic frequency selection techniques. The presence of multiple radios on each node coupled with the availability of multiple channels, facilitates concurrent signal transmissions and receptions on the WMN nodes. Thus MRMC WMNs register an enhanced network capacity and an improved spectrum ef\ufb01ciency [9, 11]. However, the technological enhancements in WMN deployments have incidentally led to an undesired increase in the interference that impedes the radio communication in such wireless networks.  1[dot]1 Research problem outline  Numerous research studies have attempted to address and resolve interference related issues in WMNs. The phe- nomena of Radio co-location Interference or RCI that is interference caused and experienced by spatially co-located radios or SCRs, that are operating on identical frequencies, is a crucial aspect of the multifaceted interference problem. But it has been largely unaddressed and \ufb01nds very little mention in the current WMN research literature. We choose to focus primarily on this issue, and strive to ade- quately address and mitigate the adverse effects of RCI in a WMN. The \ufb01rst step towards mitigation of the detrimental affects of any interference bottleneck, is its correct iden- ti\ufb01cation and representation in the con\ufb02ict graph. Thus, we accomplish our end goal by an accurate and wholesome representation of all possible RCI scenarios of a WMN in its con\ufb02ict graph.  1[dot]2 Paper organization  In Sect. 2, we touch upon the important interference related themes such as categorization and representation of wire- less interference and the interference models. In Sect. 3, we  brie\ufb02y mention some notable research literature relevant to our study. Section 4 introduces the concept of RCI sup- plemented with two crucial RCI scenarios, and a proof of concept experiment in support of the theoretical arguments. In Sect. 5, we propose two generic multi-radio multi- channel con\ufb02ict graph generation algorithms, viz, a con- ventional approach and a novel radio co-location aware approach. Section 6 comprises of simulation methodolo- gies, data traf\ufb01c characteristics and presentation and anal- ysis of recorded results. In Sect. 7 we discuss the reliability of total interference degree as a theoretical estimate of prevalent interference. In Sect. 8, we derive concrete conclusions accompanied with logical inferences based on the observed results and offered analysis. Finally, Sect. 9 outlines the future course of our research work.  2 Interference in WMNs  With the advent of MRMC deployments, the spectral complexity of the WMNs intensi\ufb01ed. This led to a sub- stantial rise in the interference endemic in WMNs, identi- \ufb01cation and mitigation of which continues to be the focus of researchers.  2[dot]1 Categorizing interference in a WMN  Interference in a WMN can be broadly classi\ufb01ed into the following three categories [12].  (a) External: interference caused by external wireless devices that is un-intentional interferers. It is uncon- trolled as external wireless devices may communi- cate over a common frequency spectrum but are beyond the supervision of the MAC protocol employed in the WMN. Examples are Microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, and other WMNs or WLANs operating in the same frequency band. (b) Internal: interference originating from within the WMN due to the broadcast nature of wireless communication. A transmission is generally isotro- pic and causes undesired interference at some of the neighboring nodes of the node for which it is intended. Network topology, channel allocation, and routing schemes have an immense impact on the intensity of internal interference. (c) Multipath Fading: it causes inter-symbol interfer- ence which occurs when the signals emanated from a particular source take multiple paths to arrive at the destination. The signals differ in time or phase at the destination and interfere with each other.  In our work, we focus only on the internal or controlled interference, as it is the primary disruptive component of  Wireless Netw  123  Author's personal copy",

      "text": "interference that leads to poor network performance in MRMC WMNs.  2[dot]2 Interference models  The next step would entail determining the con\ufb02icting wireless links in the WMN. This is a very complex problem due to the wireless nature of the network. Hence, researchers employ an accurate network interference model which is suitable for the WMN. The parameters of the model are used to ascertain the interfering or con\ufb02icting links. Selection of an appropriate model is crucial in rep- resenting complex wireless interference characteristics in a simple mathematical fashion. It is also pivotal in studying the impact on network performance and behavior, due to the adverse effects of interference. The popular approaches taken to model the interference prevalent in wireless net- works are elucidated below [13, 14].  (a) The Physical or the Additive Interference Model: it is the closest representation of the actual physical interference experienced by radios, but is complex to formulate. It takes additive interference into account and considers a \ufb01xed signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) threshold for successful data reception. Since it closely resembles a real-world interference scenario, it is a non-binary interference model. Thus a received signal may be attenuated due to interference, but as long as its strength exceeds the SINR threshold value, it is considered to be a successful transmission. (b) The Capture Threshold Model: it is a simpli\ufb01ed version of the Physical model which makes use of three threshold values instead of one. Further, the interference modeling is carried out separately for every interfering signal. (c) The Protocol Model: in this model, a transmission is successful if it does not experience any interference from other concurrent transmissions in its proximity. Every radio has a transmission and an interference range, where the latter is generally greater than the former. The interference range is usually 2\u20133 times the transmission range in actual deployments. The protocol model states that a signal transmission from radio R1 to radio R2 is deemed successful if R2 falls within the transmission range of R1, but not in the interference range of any other radio which may be active and transmitting concurrently. Consider a graph G \u00bc \u00f0V; E\u00de which represents a WMN. Here V denotes the set of all nodes in the WMN and E denotes the set of wireless links between node pairs. Further, consider three consecutive nodes of the WMN viz, xs, xd and ls, which lie on the positive  X-axis at a distance of xs, xd and ls from the origin, respectively. The protocol model deems a packet transmission on link x (xs to xd) successful, if and only if 8 l 2 E \u0003 fxg, we have  jls \u0003 xdj \u0004 \u00f01 \u00fe D\u00dejxs \u0003 xdj and \u00f01\u00de  jxs \u0003 xdj \u0005 Rc \u00f02\u00de  Where:  \u2022 \u00f0xs; 0\u00de is the source of link x. \u2022 \u00f0xd; 0\u00de is the destination of link x. \u2022 \u00f0ls; 0\u00de is the source of other link l whose destination is \u00f0xd; 0\u00de. \u2022 D is a positive parameter. \u2022 Rc stands for the effective range of communi- cation.  (d) The Interference Range Model: the model mandates the spatial separation between a receiver and an arbitrary interferer to be greater than a \ufb01xed quantity that is the interference range, for successful transmis- sion. It can be considered to be a simpli\ufb01cation of the Protocol model.  2[dot]3 Selection of interference model  The Protocol Model is a simpli\ufb01ed representation of physical interference which we use in our work for three reasons. It is a simple yet felicitous mathematical representation of the actual wireless interference. It permits a binary interference modeling, that is a successful transmission is one which is not attenuated by any interfering signal active in its transmission range. Finally, there is no \ufb01xed interference range by which two communicating nodes need to be separated. Instead, the model gives us the \ufb02exibility of \ufb01xing the interference range which is proportional to the distance between a communi- cating node pair.  2[dot]4 Representing interference in a WMN  Having successfully identi\ufb01ed the interfering wireless links in a WMN, we need to graphically represent their inter- ference relationships. This representation is done by a special graph, called the Con\ufb02ict Graph. We now state a few concepts and de\ufb01nitions. Let G \u00bc \u00f0V; E\u00de represent an arbitrary WMN.  (a) Potential Interference Link: let i 2 V, j 2 V, such that \u00f0i; j\u00de 2 E, then 8\u00f0m; n\u00de 2 E, where the transmit- ting range of the radio at node m or n, extends upto, or beyond node i or j, are called the potential interference links of link (i, j). They are also termed as con\ufb02icting links or contention edges.  Wireless Netw  123  Author's personal copy",

    {
      "text": "(b) Potential Interference Number: let i 2 V, j 2 V, then the potential interference number of link \u00f0i; j\u00de 2 E, is the total number of links in E which are the potential interference links of (i, j). It is also called as the Interference Degree. (c) Total Interference Degree (TID): it is an approxi- mate estimate of the adverse impact of the interfer- ence endemic in a WMN. It is arrived at by halving the sum of the potential interference numbers of all the links in the graph. (d) Con\ufb02ict Graph (CG): Gc \u00bc \u00f0Vc; Ec\u00de is generated from graph G \u00bc \u00f0V; E\u00de where  \u2022 Vc \u00bc E or Vc = {\u00f0i; j\u00de 2 E j (i, j) is a wireless communication link} \u2022 {\u00f0\u00f0i; j\u00de; \u00f0m; n\u00de\u00de 2 Ec j (m, n) is a potential inter- ference or con\ufb02ict link of (i, j) in G}.  Thus the edges in graph G become the vertices in Gc. There exists an edge between two vertices xc 2 Vc and yc 2 Vc, where xc \u00bc \u00f0i; j\u00de 2 E and yc \u00bc \u00f0m; n\u00de 2 E; iff the corre- sponding links in edge set E of graph G that is (i, j) and (m, n) are con\ufb02icting links. In other words, the wireless communication links in the WMN become the vertices in the con\ufb02ict graph, and any two of these vertices share an edge iff the corresponding wireless links in the WMN interfere with each other.  3 Related research work  Interference substantially degrades the wireless network performance. It leads to low end-to-end throughputs, high packet loss and high transmission delays. Multi-hop transmissions in WMNs are adversely impacted by the co- channel interference, which deteriorates network capacity and destabilizes fairness in link utilization [8]. Addressing the issue of internal co-channel interference in a WMN is of foremost importance in WMN deployments. While designing network topology, efforts are made to limit the impact of interference by optimal node placement. An MRMC architecture is better suited to be interference resilient as compared to simpler architectures. Signi\ufb01cant research work has been carried out towards alleviating the inimical impact of interference on WMN performance. For example, several MAC protocols for WMNs have been proposed [15], nodes equipped with high-power directional antennas have been deployed [1], etc But these solutions limit the scalability and span of WMNs, and are not practically viable. Thus, the most crucial design choices to ensure interference minimization in WMNs without limit- ing their scalability are: channel assignment (CA) to radios, link scheduling and routing. Numerous CA schemes [10],  and a multitude of routing algorithms [16] have been contributed in the effort to mitigate and restrain the impact of interference in WMNs. Con\ufb02ict graphs serve as the primary indispensable tool for addressing various design and performance issues in WMNs. They are extensively used for modeling and esti- mating the interference degree in wireless and cellular networks [17]. However, a basic con\ufb02ict graph (CG) is only suited to a wireless network in which each node is equipped with a single radio. In order to model the inter- ference in an MRMC WMN, the concept of CG needs to be extended to an enhanced version called the multi-radio multi-channel con\ufb02ict graph or an MMCG. Several research endeavors [4, 10, 17\u201326], directed at \ufb01nding an ef\ufb01cient CA scheme for an MRMC WMN have made use of the concept of MMCG to model the interference in their network scenario. In [4], the authors merely suggest that the con\ufb02ict graph was generated by ensuring that the interference-to-com- munication ratio is set to 2, with no further insight into the algorithmic aspects of this crucial step. In contrast, the literature in [18] de\ufb01nes two approaches to generate con- \ufb02ict graphs. The \ufb01rst de\ufb01nition is centered on the traf\ufb01c \ufb02ow interference, employing the protocol model and assuming unidirectional traf\ufb01c \ufb02ows. The second approach takes into account the link interference based on the extended protocol model. However, its evident that neither of the proposed techniques is inherently generic in its outlook. The former assumes a unidirectional traf\ufb01c \ufb02ow and mandates the application of the protocol model as the underlying interference model, while the latter necessitates the use of the extended protocol model, restricting both their approaches to speci\ufb01c WMN architectures. Likewise, authors in [10] de\ufb01ne a con\ufb02ict graph to be an undirected graph under the protocol model. Authors in [19] provide a high level de\ufb01nition of CG, with an assurance that the concept is applicable to any interference model. However, they do not explicitly pro- pose any algorithm. Further, they opine that a CG does not change with the assignment of channels to vertices. This is not a true characteristic of the MMCG of a WMN, as it often changes when different CA schemes are deployed in the WMN. Assignment of different channels to a link, under different CAs, alters the set of its con\ufb02ict links, thereby generating a different MMCG for each CA. Thus the authors\u2019 contention that a CG for a WMN will not change, does not hold true, at least in the context of an MRMC deployment. Authors in [20] discuss a single-channel CG and its multi-channel peer (MMCG) for the protocol model, without suggesting a methodical approach to generate either. In addition, they map a link to a unidirectional \ufb02ow, and a bidirectional traf\ufb01c is represented by two links. This  Wireless Netw  123  Author's personal copy",

      "text": "underscores the fact that researchers tend to perceive the interference dynamics which are a common feature of all WMNs, in a personalized way speci\ufb01c to their WMN model, rather than adopting a broadly applicable view. In [21], the authors lay a special emphasis on weighted con- \ufb02ict graphs for the protocol model. For non-interfering or non-overlapping channels, they recommend that a CG should be generated for each individual channel, and the CG for the WMN will be the union of all single channel CGs. Thus they take a single-channel view of an MRMC WMN, applied to multiple channels, and the \ufb01nal MMCG is an aggregate of the unique individual single channel CGs. The approach is intuitive and simple, but for a medium to large scale WMN where each node is equipped with multiple identical NICs, and which leverages the availability of a high number of non-interfering channels, this fragmented view of a WMN to arrive at an MMCG will cause substantial implementation overhead. The human perception of interference scenarios plays a signi\ufb01cant role in the generation of a con\ufb02ict graph. For example, the representation of WMN con\ufb02ict relationships in the MMCG proposed in [23] is quite different than the one suggested in [24]. The work in [23] aims to create a multi-dimensional CG by making use of a radio-link- channel tuple, while authors in [24] create a link-layer \ufb02ow contention graph which is essentially a simple CG, that is based upon the number of channels allocated and the channel assignment to interfaces. Based on our review, we opine that the most generic and widely applicable of all MMCG creation procedures is suggested by Ramachandran et. al. [17]. The authors extend the con\ufb02ict graph concept to model a multi-radio WMN, and generate a multi-radio con\ufb02ict graph or an MCG. They describe the MCG generation approach explaining the use an impro- vised vertex coloring algorithm to color the MCG, which ensures that each radio in the network is assigned a single channel. Yet, a lucid algorithm to generate the MCG is not proposed in the study. Any correlation between the MCG creation approach and the underlying interference model is not presented either. This leaves room for ambiguity in determining the dependence of the MCG creation tech- nique upon the interference model being employed. Most importantly, the suggested approach and the corresponding illustration does not address the interference caused and experienced by SCRs operating on identical frequencies, and thus fails to represent the RCI scenarios in its inter- ference estimate. From the literature review presented above, we can conclude that the underlying fundamental concepts of a con\ufb02ict link and a basic con\ufb02ict graph, have been rightly employed by researchers in their work. How- ever, the creation of an MMCG in the research studies often depends upon one or more of the following factors.  (a) The Interference Model being used, which is the protocol model in most studies. (b) The WMN Topology (c) Representation of Traf\ufb01c Flows that is unidirectional or bidirectional (d) Perception of the interference scenarios  Further, we have not come across any research study related to MMCG generation that adequately addresses or even highlights, the detrimental effect of multiple SCRs installed at a WMN node, which have been assigned the same channel to communicate on. In the upcoming sections we investigate and delve into the phenomena of RCI.  4 Spatial co-location of radios and radio co-location interference  An important aspect which most of the existing MMCG creation techniques fail to acknowledge, is the effect of spatial co-location of radios on wireless links, emanating from a node equipped with multiple radios. Such a node certainly stands to bene\ufb01t if each one of its radios is assigned a different RF channel and can concurrently communicate with adjacent nodes, substantially raising the capacity of the node and the entire network. The throughput at a node and by virtue of aggregation, the capacity of the entire network, can be tremendously accentuated if the RF channels being assigned are non- interfering or orthogonal. However, if two or more SCRs are operating on the same RF channel (or overlapping channels), the multi-radio deployment is rendered inef- fective and its advantages are negated. It is also adversely impacted by the additional radio co-location interference generated due to the close proximity of these SCRs. We restrict our study of RCI to SCRs operating on the same channel, which is consistent with the binary interference model that we have adopted. In this section, we investigate the impact of spatial co-location of radios on the overall interference dynamics in a WMN. We elucidate two RCI scenarios to support the theoretical proposition, and then experimentally validate the suggested argument.  4[dot]1 Two radio co-location interference scenarios  1) Case 1: consider a trivial two node wireless network illustrated in Fig. 2. Node A is equipped with one IEEE 802[dot]11g radio while node C is equipped with two identical IEEE 802[dot]11g radios that is a pair of identical SCRs. Nodes A and C lie within each others transmission range and thus share a wireless communication link in the WMN. Since the wireless communication link between the nodes A and C is a RF transmission, by virtue of RF wave  Wireless Netw  123  Author's personal copy",

      "text": "propagation, any transmission from node A will reach both radio C1 and radio C2 alike, as they are co-located at C. Similarly, both radio C1 and radio C2 are independently capable of a simultaneous transmission to the radio on node A. In the above scenario, links AC1 and AC2 are interfering links and ought to have an edge in the corresponding MMCG to represent their mutual con\ufb02ict. 2) Case 2: consider the three \ufb02avors of a WMN layout illustrated in the three scenarios of Fig. 3. The nodes are equipped with one or more IEEE 802[dot]11g radios, which are operating on the depicted radio frequencies. One of the three orthogonal channels 1, 2, and 3, as per the 802[dot]11g speci\ufb01cations, are allocated to the radios. In Fig. 3 (i), the extreme nodes A and C are equipped with a pair of SCRs, while the node at the center B, has a single radio. In Fig. 3 (ii), all the three nodes are equipped with a pair of SCRs. Both the scenarios employ common-channel communica- tion, which is evident from the radio-channel allocations. There is, however, a fundamental difference between the two scenarios with respect to node B. Figure 3 (i) emulates a Single-Radio architecture, rejecting any possibility of RCI. In contrast, Fig. 3 (ii) has dual radios at node B, both are assigned the same channel, and thus B becomes the epicenter of RCI. The wireless links AB and BC in the depicted WMN layout are the potential con\ufb02icting links. Let us focus on node B and reiterate the argument  presented in Case 1 above. For the layout in Fig. 3 (i), only the radio-links A2B1 and C1B1 are con\ufb02icting links. But for the layout in Fig. 3 (ii), the total interference degree escalates substantially as there are six con\ufb02icting radio-link pairs, viz A2B1 and A2B2, A2B1 and B1C1, A2B1 and B2C1, A2B2 and B1C1, B2C1 and B1C1 and A2B2 and B2C1. In the WMN layout in Fig. 3 (iii) the wireless links AB and BC are represented by the radio-links A2B1 and B2C1. They have been assigned channels 1 and 2, respectively, and therefore are non-con\ufb02icting links. This scenario fully utilizes the inherent multi-radio multi-channel architecture, leading to an interference free deployment. Drawing from the stated theoretical arguments we contend that in the considered trivial WMN layout, the Single Radio Common Channel (SRCC) operation in Fig. 3 (i) will perform better, even if marginally, than the Multi Radio Common Channel (MRCC) operation in Fig. 3 (ii). Further, the Multi Radio Different Channel or MRDC deployment in Fig. 3 (iii) will signi\ufb01cantly outperform the other two con\ufb01gurations.  4[dot]2 Experimental validation  To corroborate our argument with actual experimental data, simulations of the three network layouts illustrated in Fig. 3 were performed in ns-3 [27]. 1) Network Design: The inbuilt ns-3 TCP BulkSendAp- plication is employed to establish two TCP connections between node pairs A and B and B and C, for the scenarios (i), (ii), and (iii) of Fig. 3. We install a TCP BulkSendApplica- tion source at the nodes A and C. Both the TCP sinks are installed at node B, as it is the node common to all the con- \ufb02icting links, and hence the focal point of maximum inter- ference offered to the data communication. Every source sends a 10 MB data \ufb01le to its corresponding sink. We observe the Network Aggregate Throughput for each of the three scenarios, which serves as a fair metric to gauge the adverse impact of interference in the WMN layout. Simulation parameters are listed in Table 1. 2) Simulation Results: For each deployment, multiple independent sample runs were performed.

The SRCC deployment performs slightly better than the MRCC deployment. This result vindicates our theoretical contention, that the surge in interference due to SCRs operating on a common channel, degrades the network performance substantially. Here, the difference in the Average Network Aggregate Throughput of the two deployments is less than 10 %, which is not remarkable. However, we should consider the fact that in medium to large MRMC WMNs, the presence of SCRs which have been assigned the same channel is in moderate to large numbers. This increase in SCRs will exacerbate the adverse effects of RCI on the network performance. The Multi- Radio Different-Channel or the MRDC deployment offers an Aggregate Network Throughput, that is almost twice that of a trivial SRCC deployment. This is in conformity with our theoretical supposition as well. We can safely conclude, that the results of this investigation substantiate the proposed theoretical concept of RCI that is the interfer- ence caused by SCRs which have been assigned a common- channel.  4[dot]3 Impact of RCI on network performance  The severity of RCI in a wireless network depends upon the number of SCRs that have been assigned an identical channel. The two factors which decide the impact of RCI are, the number of available orthogonal channels offered by the wireless technology and the number of radios that a node in a wireless network is equipped with. We now elaborate on these factors.  \u2022 Number of orthogonal channels: availability of orthogonal channels depends upon the wireless com- munication technology being used. For example, IEEE 802[dot]11g radios operating in the 2[dot]4 GHz spectrum have only 3 orthogonal channels at their disposal. Therefore, RCI has a signi\ufb01cant impact on network performance as we have demonstrated in our study. However, 12 to 24 non-overlapping channels are available to the IEEE 802[dot]11n/ac radios operating in the 5 GHz spectrum. This will ensure that SCRs are seldom assigned identical channels, and the impact of RCI is minimal. \u2022 Number of radios per node: the number of radios installed on a wireless node depends upon the size, cost and most importantly, the power or energy  consumption of a radio. These three factors limit the number of radios that can be installed on a node.  There are two primary reasons why addressing the impact of RCI on WMNs is of great signi\ufb01cance. First, IEEE 802[dot]11g/n radios operating in the 2[dot]4 GHz band are being used in Wi-Fi networks across the globe, especially in the developing countries. In this study, we will demonstrate the severity of impact that RCI has on medium to large WMNs employing the 802[dot]11g standard through extensive simu- lations. Thus, RCI alleviation measures and techniques will immensely bene\ufb01t these WMN/WLAN deployments. Sec- ond, in the IEEE 802[dot]11n/ac networks operating in 5 GHz spectrum, currently the number of available orthogonal channels far exceeds the number of radios installed on a node. But in the foreseeable future, this relationship may change and even be reversed. Our argument is based on the developments made in the \ufb01eld of radio hardware in the last decade. Signi\ufb01cant inroads have been made in the development of carbon nanotube based nanoradios [28], \ufb01rst proposed by the well known physicist Alex Zettl. A communication architecture for nanoradios has been pro- posed in [29] which provides an operational framework for the carbon nanotube based nanoradios. Further, in [30] authors discuss the signi\ufb01cance of current pioneering research in the \ufb01eld of nanoradios, and describe the role nanonetworks are poised to play in revolutionizing the modern communication networks. With the advent of nanoradio technology, it will not be unrealistic to imagine a single wireless device equipped with dozens of nanoradios. In addition, the challenge of energy constraints in radio communication will be met through innovations in the \ufb01eld of micro-power and nano-power systems [31]. Taking these developments into consideration, it is possible that in future the number of radios present on a node in a WMN will be quite comparable to the number of available orthogonal channels. Thus, the impact of RCI in such wireless networks will be highly detrimental. It is thus imperative that we take cognizance of the RCI phenomena, and address its adverse impact on the perfor- mance of a WMN. The \ufb01rst step of this exercise would be to account for and appropriately represent the co-location interference scenarios in the interference model of a WMN. But the representation of RCI is lacking in the MMCG creation method suggested in [17], and all other research works aimed at minimization of interference in WMNs. The underlying reason is that while creating the MMCG, the fact that multiple radios installed on the same node are spatially co-located is overlooked. A result of this oversight  Table 2 Co-location experiment simulation results Parameter SRCC MRCC MRDC  Average Aggregate Network Throughput (Mbps) 3[dot]19 3[dot]01 5[dot]87  Wireless Netw  123  Author's personal copy",

      "text": "is that a few interference scenarios escape notice during the MMCG creation and the estimate is seldom a true re\ufb02ec- tion of the actual interference present in the network. Our work adopts a fundamental approach towards RCI miti- gation, which is through creation of radio co-location aware MMCGs. Since no prior research work focuses on the impact of RCI on WMNs and its mitigation, it makes our work relevant and indispensable. Having laid the the- oretical foundations, supplemented with experimental evi- dence, we formally state the research problem we aim to pursue and address in the next sub-section.  4[dot]4 Problem de\ufb01nition  Multi-Radio Multi-Channel con\ufb02ict Graphs or MMCGs are frequently used to accurately represent the interference present in a WMN and measure its intensity or degree of impact on the WMN. Thus, a generic approach to create an MMCG for any arbitrary WMN is of utmost importance. The need for a comprehensive procedure to generate an MMCG Gc \u00bc \u00f0Vc; Ec\u00de for a given input WMN graph G \u00bc \u00f0V; E\u00de, which is independent of the factors such as the WMN topology, the choice of interference model, the channel allocation scheme etc, is often felt by researchers attempting to solve CA, routing or maximum-throughput problems in a WMN.To the best of our knowledge, a lucid, all-encompassing and explicitly proposed algorithm for MMCG creation, especially one which factors in the effects of SCRs, is lacking in the current research literature. The novel concept of RCI and the alleviation of its adverse impact on the performance of a WMN, through adequate and accurate representation in the creation of its MMCG, is what distinguishes our study from the plethora of approa- ches suggested before.  5 The proposed MMCG generation algorithms  To remedy the lack of a generic algorithm, we now propose two comprehensive polynomial time algorithms to create a multi-radio multi-channel con\ufb02ict graph or an MMCG. The algorithms are designed with the vision of creating a widely applicable and versatile method of generating MMCGs. We ensure their structural and functional independence from the commonly encountered constraints listed below.  (a) The Choice of Interference Model: as stated earlier, we employ the protocol interference model to determine the interfering links. This however, is not binding upon the algorithms, and any other interference model can be chosen instead. The algorithms allow the underlying interference model to de\ufb01ne a con\ufb02icting link. Thus the choice of the  interference model is not an implementation constraint. (b) WMN Topology: the algorithms are topology inde- pendent and applicable to all WMN deployments. The graphical representation, however, must be a connected graph. This condition is reasonable, necessary and not an impediment, as having an isolated node with no wireless connectivity to any other node in the WMN is wasteful. (c) Number of Radios and Channels: the algorithms are also applicable to both single channel and multi- channel WMN deployments that is they can create MMCGs for the same WMN topology for both, a common CA and a varying/multiple CA. (d) The Channel Assignment or CA Scheme: the algorithms can generate an initial multi-radio con- \ufb02ict graph, whose edges denote potentially interfer- ing links when every radio is assigned the same channel. They can as easily generate a multi-radio multi-channel con\ufb02ict graph or an MMCG, which depicts the actual state of interference in a WMN deployment in where a CA scheme is implemented. The output MMCGs will certainly differ if the CA scheme implemented in the network changes. (f) Interpretations of Interference Scenarios: The algorithms, especially the one which takes RCI into account, consider every possible interference sce- nario in the WMN. Thus, they avoid the variations associated with the human interpretations of inter- ference scenarios.  The \ufb01rst algorithm we propose, does not take into account the effect of spatial co-location of multiple radios on a node. It follows a conventional approach, variations of which have been employed in various research endeavors, customized to suit the model being implemented. However, a versatile algorithm which is independent of the aforementioned con- straints has not been formally proposed, a void we now bridge. We christen it The Classical MMCG algorithm, or C- MMCG. The second algorithm effectively factors the RCI into its interference modeling logic. It paints a more com- prehensive and wholesome picture of the interference sce- nario in the given WMN, and is thus a notable improvement over C-MMCG. We name it The Enhanced MMCG algo- rithm, or E-MMCG for ease of reference. The two broad scenarios in a WMN where the proposed MMCG algorithms \ufb01nd great utility are elucidated below.  (a) Prior to CA: before the CA exercise is carried out in a WMN, usually all the radios are assigned a default channel. The MMCG resulting from this default channel con\ufb01guration represents a maximal preva- lent interference scenario and thus serves as an ideal input to a CA algorithm.

      "text": "(b) After CA: after the radios have been assigned appropriate channels in accordance with the applied CA scheme, the proposed MMCG algorithms may be used to generate the TID estimate for the WMN. This desirable feature facilitates a theoretical assess- ment of the ef\ufb01cacy of the CA approach employed. Now we propose the two algorithms along with their functional description.  5[dot]1 The classical MMCG algorithm  The C-MMCG algorithm adopts a conventional approach to model the interference endemic in WMNs. Its stepwise procedure is described in Algorithm 1. Steps 1\u201310 split each node in the original WMN topology graph G \u00bc \u00f0V; E\u00de, into the number of radios it is equipped with, and generate an intermediate graph G0 \u00bc \u00f0V0; E0\u00de, where V0  represents the set of total number of wireless radios in the WMN and E is edge set of links between radio pairs.  Algorithm 1 C-MMCG : Radio Co-location Not Considered  Input: G = (V, E), Ri(i \u2208V ), Ni(i \u2208V ) = { j|(j \u2208V ) && (i = j) && ((i, j) \u2208E) } Initially : V \u2190\u00d8, E \u2190\u00d8, Vc \u2190\u00d8, Ec \u2190\u00d8 Notations : G \u2190WMN Graph, Ri \u2190Radio-Set, Ni \u2190Neighbour Set Output: Gc = (Vc, Ec)  1: for i \u2208V do  2: V \u2190V + Ri 3: for j \u2208Ni do  4: for x \u2208Ri do 5: for y \u2208Rj do  6: E \u2190E + (x, y)  7: end for 8: end for  9: end for  10: end for{Get the intermediate graph G = (V , E )} 11: for (i, j) \u2208E where i \u2208V , j \u2208V do  12: Vc \u2190Vc + (i, j) 13: end for{Create the Vertex Set Vc of the CG Gc}  14: for v \u2208Vc, u \u2208Vc, v = u do  15: Use an Interference Model to determine if u & v are Potentially Interfering Links  16: if True then  17: if (Channel(u) == Channel(v)) then 18: Ec \u2190Ec + (u, v) {Create the Edge Set Ec of the CG Gc} 19: end if  20: end if  21: end for{Output C-MMCG Gc = (Vc, Ec)}  While G re\ufb02ects a node centric view of the WMN, G0  re\ufb02ects the view of the WMN at the granularity of indi- vidual radios. Step 2 splits the radio set of each node in G  to individual radio-nodes in G0. Steps 3\u201310, process the neighbor set of a node in G to create edges in E0, for each individual radio in the radio-set of the node in context. The intermediate graph G0 becomes the input for the \ufb01nal MMCG creation step. In steps 11\u201313, the vertex set Vc of the MMCG is populated by adding elements of the edge-set E0. Further, in steps 14\u201321, the vertices in Vc are processed pairwise, and a corresponding edge is added to the MMCG edge-set Ec, iff the vertex pair being currently processed is con\ufb02icting, and both the vertices have been assigned the same channel. The function Channel() fetches the channel assigned to a particular vertex of Gc. As described earlier, the channel returned by the function would be the default channel if the algorithm is being applied to a WMN prior to the CA exercise. Else, Channel() would fetch the channel that has been assigned by the CA scheme employed in the WMN. The underlying interference model determines whether a vertex pair is con\ufb02icting. We have employed the Protocol Interference Model, but as stated earlier, any other interference model may be used as well. Algorithm 1 \ufb01nally outputs the C-MMCG, Gc. The algorithmic time complexity is O\u00f0n2\u00de, as each of the three functional steps viz, creating the intermediate graph G0, generating the vertices of C-MMCG Gc, and \ufb01nally adding the edge set to C-MMCG Gc, have an O\u00f0n2\u00de computational complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the WMN.  5[dot]2 The enhanced MMCG algorithm  The E-MMCG considers all possible interference scenarios that exist in a WMN, including the RCI. The stepwise procedure to generate an E-MMCG for a WMN is descri- bed in Algorithm 2. In addition to the C-MMCG logic, Algorithm 2 also captures interference due to spatial co- location of radios in the WMN. In steps 22\u201328, the algo- rithm adds an edge between two vertices of the E-MMCG, iff  (a) The corresponding pair of wireless links in the WMN originate or terminate at the same node and, (b) The links have been assigned the same channel.  The RCI accounting steps will apply to both common and multiple channel deployments in the WMN, preserving its generic nature. E-MMCG thus ensures that the interference scenarios discussed in Sect. 4, which are not being addressed in the existing research literature are accounted for. Further, the injection of the RCI into the overall interference dynamics is duly represented by addition of necessary and suf\ufb01cient links in the E-MMCG. The links added to the E-MMCG to account for the RCI, are char- acteristic of the E-MMCG algorithm, and are generated from its steps 22\u201328. These con\ufb02icting links may or may not be determined by the employed interference model, but  Wireless Netw  123  Author's personal copy",

Figure 4 (i) depicts the original WMN topology comprising of four nodes, A, B, C and D, where the nodes are assigned 2, 1, 1, and 2 number of radios, respectively. Each radio is oper- ating on the default channel, so the two methods will generate the initial, maximal-con\ufb02ict MMCG for the WMN. The graphical representations of C-MMCG and E- MMCG, for the given WMN layout, are exhibited in cases  (ii) and (iii) of Fig. 4, respectively. Upon observation, it is evident that E-MMCG has all the con\ufb02icting links present in C-MMCG, and in addition contains four more interfer- ing links, viz A0B0\u2013A1C0, A1B0\u2013A0C0, B0D0\u2013 C0D1 and C0D0\u2013B0D1. These four con\ufb02icting links are the result of RCI, which is caused by the wireless transmissions from radios spatially co-located at nodes A and D. The number of these additional con\ufb02ict links caused by RCI increases drastically with the size of the WMN, which we demonstrate in Sect. 6. The ability of E-MMCG algo- rithm to capture and represent the interference scenarios spawned by RCI is the \ufb01rst step towards alleviating the adverse impact of RCI.  6 Simulations, results and analysis  Having proposed the two MMCG algorithms, it is imper- ative we prove their relevance to real-world WMN deployments. We take a three pronged approach in this regard.  6[dot]1 Measuring impact of interference  We employ the MMCG algorithms to measure the TID in a WMN, and compare the results of the two \ufb02avors. We consider a square Grid Layout for the WMNs, of size 5n \u0006 5n where n \u00bc f1; 2; . . ; 10g. Thus the size of WMNs varies from 5 \u0006 5 nodes to 50 \u0006 50 nodes, where all the nodes are equipped with two identical radios, and all radios are on a common channel. This con\ufb01guration represents a maximal interference scenario, and is ideal for analysis.

      "text": "topologies. The results illustrated in Fig. 5 underscore the fact that the E-MMCG algorithm accounts for all the po- tential interfering links or interference scenarios present in a WMN, and hence registers substantially high values of TID. In contrast, the C-MMCG algorithm suffers from a limited potency to probe a WMN for potential interfering links as it does not factor in the presence of SCRs operating on a common channel. This is re\ufb02ected by its poor accounting of Interference Degree values as compared to its enhanced counterpart, the E-MMCG. Further, as the size of WMN grows, the difference in the TID of the two MMCG approaches becomes increasingly prominent. This implies that there is a tremendous upsurge in the RCI as the size and complexity of the WMN increases. This \ufb01nding further consolidates the proposition we put forward in Sect. 4, that the adverse impact of RCI gets more pro- nounced in medium to large WMNs.  6[dot]2 Application to CA algorithms  Since Con\ufb02ict Graphs serve as the input to Channel Assignment algorithms, the next logical step is to apply the MMCG algorithms to two graph-theoretic solutions of the CA problem. In [17] authors propose a Breadth First Search approach or BFS-CA, which is a centralized dynamic algorithm that employs the services of a channel assignment server or CAS. Initially, the radios in the WMN are assigned a default channel which experiences the least interference from intentional or un-intentional interferers in close proximity, based on a channel-ranking technique. The CAS computes the average distance of each vertex in the multi-radio con\ufb02ict graph (MCG) from the gateway. Thereafter, the algorithm performs a breadth-\ufb01rst scan of the MCG, starting from the vertices closest to the gateway, and assigns a channel to every vertex that it encounters. To  every vertex, CAS tries to assign a channel which is orthogonal to the channels assigned to its neighboring nodes. Else, it selects a channel randomly from the set of available channels and allots it to the current vertex. A Maximal Independent Set channel assignment scheme or MaIS-CA is proposed in [26]. It is a greedy heuristic scheme, which determines the maximal independent set of vertices in a con\ufb02ict graph, assigns them an identical channel and then removes them from the con\ufb02ict graph. This process is iterated, until all the vertices have been assigned a channel. We opine that MaIS-CA is algorithmically superior to BFS-CA as its CA approach distributes the channels among the radios in a more balanced fashion, and also assures a higher degree of connectivity in the WMN graph. For a theoretical validation of the stated notion, we implement these two CA algorithms in Grid WMNs. Both C-MMCG and E-MMCG versions serve as the input to CA schemes, and the TID for each CA scheme is determined. The nodes are equipped with two identical radios each, and we utilize the three non-overlapping channels guaranteed by IEEE 802[dot]11g speci\ufb01cations. For a smooth discourse hereon, we adopt the following nomenclature to differentiate between the CAs.  \u2022 C-MMCG based CAs: BFS-CA1 and MaIS-CA1. \u2022 E-MMCG based CAs: BFS-CA2 and MaIS-CA2.  The procedure we follow is described below:  \u2022 Take WMN grid of size n \u0006 n, where n 2 f3; 5; 10g. \u2022 Create two MMCGs using the algorithms C-MMCG and E-MMCG. \u2022 Use both \ufb02avors of MMCG as input to BFS-CA and MaIS-CA to obtain \ufb01nal CAs, 4 in all. \u2022 Apply C-MMCG on BFS-CA1 and MaIS-CA1 and E-MMCG on BFS-CA2 and MaIS-CA2, to estimate their respective TIDs.  This procedure will furnish the theoretical measure of the impact of interference in each of the \ufb01nal CAs. For con- sistency, we subject a particular version of a CA only to the corresponding MMCG algorithm, to compute the TID estimate. Further, we only compare two CAs generated from the same MMCG approach. Comparing the interfer- ence estimate of a C-MMCG CA with an E-MMCG CA is not logical, because the approaches to generate these esti- mates are not identical. It can be inferred from Table 3, that the BFS-CA of a particular MMCG version registers a higher measure of interference than the corresponding MaIS-CA, that is with respect to TID of CAs, BFS-CA 1 [ MaIS-CA 1 and BFS- CA 2 [ MaIS-CA 2. This result strengthens the argument that MaIS-CA is a better CA scheme than BFS-CA.

We create an extensive data traf\ufb01c scenario by considering various single-hop and multi-hop transmission combinations. Our objectives are four fold.  (a) To compare the performance characteristics of E-MMCG CA against that of the C-MMCG version, for the same CA algorithm. (b) To compare the performance of the two approaches, BFS-CA and MaIS-CA, for both versions of MMCG. (c) To observe the relative difference between the performances of BFS-CA and MaIS-CA, in the two versions of MMCG. (d) To observe the traf\ufb01c interruptions or abrupt \ufb02ow terminations, for a CA, in both versions of MMCG.  Through objectives (b) and (c) above, we intend to study the consistency in CA performance that is if X-CA performs better than Y-CA in the C-MMCG model, then we opine that it should outperform Y-CA in the E-MMCG model as well. Further, we study the difference between the perfor- mances of X-CA and Y-CA for a relative comparison. 1) Simulation Design Parameters: we consider a 5 \u0006 5 grid WMN, which provides some semblance of a large- scale topology. To gauge the impact of interference on the WMN, we choose the Aggregate Throughput of the net- work, as the primary performance metric. The total capacity of a network consistently degrades with the increase in interference, and it is thus a suitable and suf- \ufb01cient metric. We also employ Packet Loss Ratio and Mean Delay of the network as metrics for some scenarios. While packet loss ratio gives a measure of data packets lost during communication, the Mean Delay provides the end- to-end latency in packet transmission. Thus both of them  are reliable indicators of the disruption caused in data transmission by the prevalent interference. TCP and UDP are the underlying transport layer pro- tocols being used in the experiments. The inbuilt ns-3 models of BulkSendApplication and UdpClientServer are utilized for TCP and UDP implementations, respectively. TCP simulations are aimed at estimating the Aggregate Network Throughput while the UDP simulations are employed to determine the Packet Loss Ratio and the Mean Delay. For ease of reference, hereon we denote the three metrics as ThroughputNet, PLR and MD, respectively. The radios installed on all nodes are identical IEEE 802[dot]11g radios, operating in the standard speci\ufb01ed 2[dot]4 GHz spectrum that offers up to 14 channels, of which 3 channels are orthogonal. We restrict the number of avail- able channels to these three non-interfering channels. We employ the ERP-OFDM modulation technique, with a ceiling of 9 Mbps on the maximum PHY data-rate. We let the transmission power assume the default value of 16[dot]02 dBm, and set the receiver gain to \u000310 dBm for better sensitivity. Nodes are placed at a separation of 200 mts, so that the adjacent nodes lie comfortably within each other\u2019s transmission range. Use of Range Propagation Loss Model in ns-3 facilitates an easy implementation of the protocol model for interference modeling. The remaining simulation parameters are listed in Table 4. 2) Data Traf\ufb01c Characteristics: the most critical step in studying the impact of interference in a WMN is to tailor the right set of traf\ufb01c \ufb02ows, which will identify and expose the interference bottlenecks. To simulate a data traf\ufb01c with suitable characteristics, we consider \ufb01ve types of TCP/ UDP traf\ufb01c \ufb02ows which include both, single and multi-hop \ufb02ows. We deploy a combination of these \ufb02ow-types to characterize the intensity of interference present in a 5 \u0006 5 grid WMN. The 25 nodes in the WMN grid are numbered from 1 to 25, for the sake of representation. The traf\ufb01c \ufb02ows are depicted in Fig. 6, followed by a brief description of each \ufb02ow. The TCP/UDP client or source, can be identi\ufb01ed by the dotted tail of the link representing the TCP/UDP connection, while the arrow-head signi\ufb01es the TCP/UDP server or the sink.  (a) One Hop Horizontal Flow or 1-HHF: single Hop TCP connections are established between alternate node pairs in all the rows of the WMN grid depicted in Fig. 6. For example, in row 1, node-pairs (1 and 2) and (3 and 4) have a one hop TCP connection. TCP source application is installed on the node repre- sented by a smaller number, and the sink application on the node bearing the bigger number in the node- pair. (b) One Hop Vertical Flow or 1-HVF: in addition to the 1-hop horizontal \ufb02ows, one hop TCP vertical \ufb02ows,  Table 3 A comparison of TIDs of the MMCG CAs  Grid size TID  BFS-CA MaIS-CA  C-MMCG E-MMCG C-MMCG E-MMCG  3 \u0006 3 82 70 16 56  5 \u0006 5 436 716 142 488  10 \u0006 10 2098 2470 834 2036  Wireless Netw  123  Author's personal copy",

(c) Four Hop Horizontal Flow or 4-HHF: since multi- hop transmission is an inherent trait of WMNs, we deploy TCP/UDP connections between the \ufb01rst and last nodes of each row, which are four hops away. (d) Four Hop Vertical Flow or 4-HVF: to capture the spatial interference characteristics of the grid in the vertical direction, TCP/UDP connections are estab- lished in a top-down fashion that is between the \ufb01rst and last nodes of each column, which are four hops away. (e) Eight Hop Diagonal Flows or 8-HDF: the diagonally opposite node-pairs (1 and 25) and (21 and 5) have a TCP/UDP connection each, and generate eight-hop TCP/UDP \ufb02ows. This is the maximum possible hop- length between a source and destination pair, in the given simulation grid.  3) Simulation Terminology, Scenarios and Statistics: to keep the discourse lucid and coherent, we \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne some terms we use in the upcoming sections.  (a) Flow: it refers to the onward TCP/UDP traf\ufb01c \ufb02ow from a TCP/UDP source to the TCP/UDP sink. (b) Abrupt Flow: in all the TCP connections, we mandate that the source should transmit 10 MB data to the sink. For a TCP connection to be deemed successful, it is imperative that the sink should receive the 10 MB data sent by the source in entirety. Else, the TCP connection is considered to have abruptly terminated, and the \ufb02ow to be an Abrupt Flow. Abrupt \ufb02ows are a measure of the obstructions caused by prevalent interference to the data transmissions in a WMN. This notion is predicated on the fact that routing failures are often caused by high levels of interference in multi-hop wireless networks [32]. Loss of routing information causes packets buffered at intermediate relay nodes to be dropped. Since the routing protocol is singu- larly responsible for the routing mechanism, a TCP source may never be aware of an alternate route or route re-establishment. Thus, after subsequent failed attempts at re-transmitting the packets, a connection- timeout is invoked at the source and eventually the \ufb02ow is abruptly terminated. (c) Abrupt Flow Count (AFC): it is the total number of Abrupt Flows encountered in all the simulations of a Test Case Class. (d) ThroughputNet: it refers to the Network Aggregate Throughput, which is the aggregate throughput of all the \ufb02ows in a simulation. (e) Flow-RX: a 4-HHF TCP \ufb02ow in any row X of the grid. (f) Flow Type-Y or FT-Y: a set of all possible combi- nations of 4-HHFs taken Y at a time, where Y 2 f1. . .5g. Thus, FT-1 would be a set containing 5C1 or \ufb01ve 4-HHFs, viz Flow-R1, Flow-R2, Flow- R3, Flow-R4 and Flow-R5.  We segregate the simulation scenarios into combinations of one-hop \ufb02ows and multi-hop \ufb02ows. The underlying moti- vation is to monitor the behavior of CAs for single-hop \ufb02ows, and more complex multi-hop \ufb02ows, separately. The test-cases have been categorized into the following three classes.  (a) Test Case Class 1: \ufb02ow sustenance testing In the test-cases belonging to this class, numerous one-hop TCP connections are concurrently active. The moti- vation here is to highlight the capability of a WMN to establish and sustain multiple TCP connections under the debilitating effects of interference.

      "text": "these test-cases are focused on the number of abrupt \ufb02ows encountered that is the AFC, rather than the ThroughputNet. The test-cases under this class are listed below.  (i) Test Case 1: only vertical \ufb02ows that is 1-HVFs. (ii) Test Case 2: only horizontal \ufb02ows that is 1-HHFs. (iii) Test Case 3: all vertical and horizontal \ufb02ows that is 1-HVFs ? 1-HHFs.  (b) Test Case Class 2: \ufb02ow injection testing Multi-hop transmissions are a primary characteristic of WMNs. Concurrent multi-hop data connections are the prefect instruments for estimating the adverse impact of interference on the network capacity, as they transmit in tandem, triggering and intensifying the intricate interference bottlenecks in a WMN. We start with a single 4-HHF, and then inject one additional 4-HHF in each subsequent test-case. We monitor the network response to injection of fresh four-hop \ufb02ows in terms of the network capacity, for a variety of 4HHF combinations. Here we focus only on monitoring the throughput response of the network and not the number of abrupt \ufb02ow termi- nations. The goal here is to record the variation in network performance with the continuous injection of additional four-hop \ufb02ows, hence it will suf\ufb01ce to do so for \ufb02ows along the rows of the grid. We consider the \ufb01ve 4-HHFs that is Flow-R1...Flow-R5, and create a test-case for each Flow Type-Y or FT-Y, where Y 2 f1. . .5g. Thus, we have the following test-cases.  (i) Test Case 1: FT-1 that is 5C1 4-HHF combinations. (ii) Test Case 2: FT-2 that is 5C2 4-HHF combinations. (iii) Test Case 3: FT-3 that is 5C3 4-HHF combinations. (iv) Test Case 4: FT-4 that is 5C4 4-HHF combinations. (v) Test Case 5: FT-5 that is 5C5 4-HHF combinations.  (c) Test Case Class 3: load or stress testing A reliable measure of network performance is often gauged under peak load, as it exhibits a network\u2019s resilience to bottlenecks that occur only at high traf\ufb01c demands. We perform four test-cases of increasing data traf\ufb01c demands. By virtue of the rise in the number of concurrent radio transmissions, there is an increase in the interference complexities of the  network. For each of these scenarios, we observe and analyze not only the network capacity, but also the packet loss ratio (PLR) and mean delay (MD). Thus both TCP and UDP simulations are run for each of the the test-cases described below.  (i) Test Case 1: D2 that is concurrent twin diagonal TCP/UDP \ufb02ows or 8-HDFs. (ii) Test Case 2: H4V4 that is eight concurrent TCP/UDP \ufb02ows comprising of adjacent 4-HHF and 4-HVFs, each taken four at a time. A total of four such combinations, for which simulations are run and the average ThroughputNet is considered. (iii) Test Case 3: H5V5 that is ten concurrent TCP/ UDP \ufb02ows consisting of all \ufb01ve 4-HHFs and all \ufb01ve 4-HVFs. (iv) Test Case 4: H5V5D2 that is twelve concur- rent TCP/UDP \ufb02ows consisting of all \ufb01ve 4-HHFs, all \ufb01ve 4-HVFs, and both 8-HDFs.  6[dot]4 Results and analysis  The four CAs viz, BFS-CA1, BFS-CA2, MaIS-CA1 and MaIS-CA2, are subjected to the test-cases described above. The metrics we monitor and register for subsequent anal- ysis are Throughput Net, AFC, PLR and MD. We now present the recorded results, and methodically analyze them in adherence to the four objectives stated in Sect. 6[dot]3. 1) Test Case Class 1: The metric of relevance here is the Abrupt Flow Count or AFC, which for C-MMCG CAs is quite higher than the corresponding E-MMCG CAs. This can be inferred from the graph displayed in Fig. 7. BFS-CA2 is able to achieve a 12:7 % reduction in abrupt termination of \ufb02ows over BFS- CA1. Likewise, we record a 21:53 % drop in AFC for MaIS-CA2, when compared to MaIS-CA1. Further, a comparison of the two CA approaches underscores the consistency of MaIS-CA in outperforming BFS-CA, for both the MMCG approaches. MaIS-CA1 registers 40:9 % lesser abrupt \ufb02ow terminations than BFS-CA1, and this improvement is more accentuated in MaIS-CA2 where the frequency of abrupt \ufb02ows depreciates by 46:8 % when compared to BFS-CA2. From the perspective of relative performance in terms of Abrupt Flow Count, E-MMCG approach heightens the edge that MaIS-CA has over BFS-CA. This is evident from the relative decrease in AFC of 14:4 % achieved in the E-MMCG CAs, over their C-MMCG peers. This result is arrived at by the simple expression (% Drop in E-MMCG \u0003 % Drop in C-MMCG) / % Drop in C-MMCG). Thus, the E-MMCG CAs not only reduce the abrupt terminations  Wireless Netw  123  Author's personal copy",

ThroughputNet is not an ideal metric to compare the CA performances in Test Case Class 1, but for consistency the ThroughputNet results are presented in Table 5. MaIS-CA performs unarguably better than BFS-CA which is in accordance with the TID estimates shown in Table 3. In all the test-cases E-MMCG CAs perform slightly better than their C-MMCG peers. The only exception is observed in Test Case 2 that is Only 1-HHFs, where MaIS-CA1 [ MaIS-CA2. This reversal is recti\ufb01ed in Test Case 3 that is All 1-HHFs and 1-HVFs, which is a more comprehensive test scenario and a relatively better case for observing ThroughputNet. 2) Test Case Class 2: We now analyze the response of the CA deployments in the WMN in terms of observed ThroughputNet, as new four-hop \ufb02ows are injected in the network. Results of Test Case Class 2, which consists of a variety of multi-hop test- cases, are exhibited as a graph in Fig. 8. The ThroughputNet  recorded for each of the \ufb01ve test-cases in this class, rep- resented by FT-Y, where Y 2 f1:::5g, is plotted for the four CA schemes. It is clearly evident that the E-MMCG ver- sion of a CA outperforms the C-MMCG version by a sig- ni\ufb01cant margin. For a reference, we quote the statistics of FT-5 from Fig. 8, for all the four CAs. The ThroughputNet values of BFS-CA1, BFS-CA2, MaIS-CA1, and MaIS-CA2, are recorded to be 1[dot]711, 1[dot]88, 2[dot]26 and 3[dot]36 Mbps, respectively. We process the results to determine the change, that is increase or decrease, in the observed ThroughputNet values of the two variants of the same CA, in Table 6. The ThroughputNet value of the C-MMCG version of a CA is considered as the base. ThroughputNet values of BFS-CA2 are higher than those of BFS-CA1 for all Flow Types, however always within the modest range of 10\u201315:2 %. A more prominent increase in ThroughputNet can be noticed in MaIS-CA2 with respect to MaIS-CA1. The rise in ThroughputNet values ranges from 13:4 % in FT-1, to a maximum of 48:5 % in FT-5. This increase in ThroughputNet of MaIS-CA2, continues to rise from Flow Type-1 to Flow Type-5, that is with the increase in the number of concurrent \ufb02ows injected in the network. The second objective is to assess how the two CA schemes fare against one another, in both the MMCG models. It can be inferred that MaIS-CA performs substantially better than BFS-CA, irrespective of the MMCG model.

      "text": "it is of great relevance to study the variation of the dif- ference in ThroughputNet values recorded for the two CA schemes, in the two MMCG models. Thus, we compute the % difference in ThroughputNet values of BFS-CA and MaIS-CA for each MMCG model in Table 7. Through- putNet values of BFS-CA are considered as the base, and the % increase or decrease of MaIS-CA over BFS-CA is calculated, for the particular MMCG variant. A % decrease, is preceded by a negative sign. In the C-MMCG deployment, MaIS-CA1 records a signi\ufb01cant increase over BFS-CA1 that falls in the range of 32[dot]3\u201360:7 %. In the E-MMCG deployment, MaIS-CA2 surpasses its C-MMCG variant, registering tremendous increase over BFS-CA2 ThroughputNet is in the range of 57[dot]4\u201379:2 %. Further, we calculate the relative difference of the increase in ThroughputNet that MaIS-CA shows over BFS-CA, between the two MMCG models, as a % with C-MMCG as the base. The relative difference is slightly negative at (\u00031:2 %) for FT-1, but this result is not unsettling for two simple reasons. First, that FT-1 is a minimalistic test scenario with just one 4-HHF active at a time, and second being the diminished magnitude of this relative decrease. Besides, the % relative increase rises immensely from FT-2 through FT-5, to reach a high of 142 % at FT-5, which is the most comprehensive interfer- ence scenario. 3) Test Case Class 3: This class of test-cases is aimed at measuring the net- work performance in terms of ThroughputNet, PLR and MD, under heavy network data traf\ufb01c. The test-cases of this class are complex as they involve a high number of concurrent multi-hop TCP/UDP connections, causing almost every interference scenario to affect the data transmission. The ThroughputNet results of the stress test- ing exercise are presented for analysis in the graphs depicted in Fig. 9. The overall performance of E-MMCG CAs continues to be better than their corresponding C-MMCG peers, but we can observe a few deviations from the trend. In test-case H4V4, MaIS-CA1 registers a higher ThroughputNet than MaIS-CA2 although by an insigni\ufb01cant margin of 0:24 %. Further, in the peak load scenario H5V5D2, the Through- putNet of BFS-CA1 is higher than that of BFS-CA2 by  11:4 %, which can be noticed in Table 8. The two instances in which a C-MMCG CA performs equal to or better than the corresponding E-MMCG CA do not raise any doubts about the ef\ufb01cacy of the E-MMCG model, but instead highlight the temporal and spatial characteristics of the endemic interference. Even a reasonably good CA scheme may register a sub-par performance for a particular traf\ufb01c scenario. In all the remaining test-cases, the E-MMCG CAs outperform their C-MMCG counterparts, registering noticeable increase in ThroughputNet that falls within the range of 8[dot]4\u201319:3 %. Let us now examine how the two CA schemes fare against one another, in the two MMCG models. In Table 9, the % difference in ThroughputNet values of BFS-CA and MaIS-CA for each MMCG model is computed. MaIS-CA proves to be better than BFS-CA, regardless of the MMCG model employed. Secondly, the % difference between the E-MMCG CAs is more pronounced in all scenarios except for the test-case H4V4, where it is 27:8 % while it is 39 % for the C-MMCG model. This reversal is the outcome of the fact that both versions of MaIS-CA viz MaIS-CA1 and MaIS-CA2, demonstrate similar ThroughputNet character- istics in H4V4, while BFS-CA2 registers a higher value than BFS-CA1 as expected. Thus, the % relative difference of the increase in ThroughputNet that MaIS-CA shows over  Table 7 % Difference in ThroughputNet values of BFS-CA and MaIS-CA for an MMCG approach in Test Case Class 2  MMCG model % Difference in ThroughputNet in FT  1 2 3 4 5  C\u0003MMCG 58[dot]1 60[dot]7 56[dot]8 47[dot]7 32[dot]3  E\u0003MMCG 57[dot]4 63[dot]7 75[dot]3 79[dot]2 78[dot]4  Relative difference (%) -1[dot]2 4[dot]9 32[dot]5 66 142   0   0[dot]5   1   1[dot]5   2   2[dot]5   3   3[dot]5   4   4[dot]5   5  D2 H4V4 H5V5 H5V5D2  Network Throughput (Mbps)  Test Case  BFS-CA1 BFS-CA2 MaIS-CA1 MaIS-CA2  Fig. 9 ThroughputNet in Test Case Class 3  Table 8 % Change in ThroughputNet values of an E-MMCG CA over corresponding C-MMCG CA in Test Case Class 3  CA strategy % Change in ThroughputNet in Test Case  D2 H4V4 H5V5 H5V5D2  BFS 10[dot]4 8[dot]4 15[dot]1 -11[dot]4  MaIS 18[dot]2 -0[dot]2 19[dot]3 17[dot]4  Wireless Netw  123  Author's personal copy",

      "text": "BFS-CA, between the two MMCG models, is positive for all test scenarios except for test-case H4V4. Moving on to the observed PLR values, let us examine the graph in Fig. 10 and the corresponding processed results in Table 10. In all test-cases, the E-MMCG CAs suffer from a much lesser PLR then the respective C-MMCG CAs, thereby implying a reduced impact of interference on the data transmissions. Further, in  accordance with the earlier result trends, PLR results also highlight that MaIS-CA2 registers a greater reduction in PLR over MaIS-CA1 than BFS-CA2 does over BFS-CA1. The % relative difference of decrease in PLR values that MaIS-CA shows over BFS-CA, between the two MMCG models, is positive for all values except D2 where it is \u00035:9 %. For the remaining test-cases the relative difference is positive, always above 10 % and as high as 43 %. Thus, we can infer from Table 11 that the E-MMCG model accentuates the decrease in PLR registered by MaIS-CA over BFS-CA, as compared to the C-MMCG model where this decrease is less prominent . The \ufb01nal metric of interest here is the MD, the recorded results for which are depicted in the graph in Fig. 11. Deviating from the pattern of other metrics, MaIS-CA does not command a clear advantage over BFS-CA with respect to MD. In fact, the observed values for the two CAs \ufb02uc- tuate and can not be compared, which is easily discernible from Fig. 11. For most test-scenarios BFS-CA2 registers the minimum MD values performing better than even MaIS-CA2. Therefore, we restrict our analysis to the reduction in MD that an E-MMCG CA registers over its corresponding C-MMCG CA. The processed results are presented in Table 12.

      "text": "E-MMCG CAs succeed in reducing packet transmission latency in the WMN grid as compared to their conventional counterparts. Through these experiments we have successfully demonstrated that the same CA scheme exhibits better performance when it receives an E-MMCG as input, as compared to a C-MMCG as input. The E-MMCG ensures that a lesser number of SCRs are assigned identical chan- nels by the CA scheme, which in turn leads to a decrease in RCI in the network. Further, the proposed MMCG algo- rithms enable a CA scheme to reduce the link con\ufb02icts and minimize the impact of interference, but do not make any assumptions or place any restrictions on the functioning of the CA schemes. Thus, the MMCG algorithms do not alter the algorithmic disposition of a CA scheme. Having stated the results of the testing effort, we now make reasonable inferences and logical conclusions. But before that, we make an observation regarding TID in the next section.  7 Total interference degree: a reliable theoretical metric?  The theoretical measure of Interference Degree can be both local that is of an individual node, and total that is of a CA scheme in entirety [33]. This concept has been generously used in the WMN research literature to ef\ufb01ciently solve research problems such as the CA problem, the routing and scheduling problems etc [34]. With respect to the CA problem, the guiding idea is that a CA with lesser TID, will be more ef\ufb01cient and register better performance as com- pared to a CA with a higher TID [35]. However, we have observed that this theoretical idea does not always hold true when compared to the actual experimental data. In any domain relying primarily on experimentation and actual deployments, the proposed theories are seldom accurate or precise. Thus there is an acceptable threshold of deviation of real-time performance from the theoretical predictions. But in the case of TID of CAs, we contend that the rea- sonable threshold of acceptance is breached. In this section, we elaborate upon this problem. On the basis of recorded network metrics, we now arrange the four CAs in the following sequence of  decreasing performance: MaIS-CA2 [ MaIS-CA1 [ BFS-CA2 [ BFS-CA1. Further, let us observe Table 3 again, and consider the TID values of CAs for the 5 \u0006 5 WMN grid. Earlier we had compared the TIDs of two CAs belonging to the same MMCG model and made theoretical inferences. Instead of that, now if we consider the TID values of all four CAs irrespective of the MMCG model, the theoretical order of expected performance based on the TID values would be: MaIS-CA1 [ BFS-CA1 [ MaIS- CA2 [ BFS-CA2. It is clear that this theoretical sequence is not in conformity with the established experimental sequence. A counter-argument may be presented that since a particular MMCG model was employed to compute the TIDs only for the CAs of the same model, a comparison of cross-model TID values is not logical. Hence, for a con- sistency in the approach taken to generate TID values, we employ the following two alternative methods to generate the TID values for all four CAs, regardless of the MMCG model they belong to.  (a) Compute TIDs using the C-MMCG algorithm. (b) Compute TIDs using the E-MMCG algorithm.  We plot the computed TID values against the Through- putNet values recorded in test-case FT-5 of Test Case Class 2, in Fig. 12. The plot-lines for titles C-MMCG and E-MMCG correspond to the TIDs generated using the C-MMCG and the E-MMCG algorithm, respectively. The (TID, Throughput Net) co-ordinates for the CA quartet MaIS-CA1, MaIS-CA2, BFS-CA1, BFS-CA2 are labeled as M1; M2; B1 and B2, respectively. Further, the C-MMCG plot labels are pre\ufb01xed by a \u2019c\u2019, and the E-MMCG plot labels are pre\ufb01xed by an \u2019e\u2019. The plots for both the MMCG models are almost iden- tical in shape and gradient, differing only in terms of the TID values. The E-MMCG CA versions register higher value of TIDs, which is expected as the model factors in  Table 12 % Reduction in MD of an E-MMCG CA over corre- sponding C-MMCG CA in Test Case Class 3  CA strategy % Reduction in MD in Test Case  D2 H4V4 H5V5 H5V5D2  BFS 10[dot]5 23[dot]5 14[dot]4 8[dot]6  MaIS 1[dot]0 4[dot]5 7[dot]4 5[dot]0   1   1[dot]5   2   2[dot]5   3   3[dot]5   4   0  100  200  300  400  500  600  700  Network Throughput (Mbps)  Total Interference Degree  C-MMCG  cB1  cB2  cM1  cM2  E-MMCG  eB1  eB2  eM1  eM2  Fig. 12 Correlation of TID with ThroughputNet for FT-5  Wireless Netw  123  Author's personal copy",

      "text": "the RCI scenarios too. Considering TID values to be the theoretical measure of expected performance, the sequence of CAs is the same for both methods: MaIS-CA1 [ MaIS- CA2 [ BFS-CA1 [ BFS-CA2. Assuming that the TID estimates are a reliable measure of CA performance, the ThroughputNet should decrease consistently with the rise in TID values, though not necessarily in a linear fashion. However, the two plots do not adhere to the expected pattern and exhibit a marked deviation which raises a valid concern about TID being a reliable theoretical metric to predict the performance of a CA. To validate this argument, we try to ascertain if there exists a strong correlation between the TID estimate of a CA and its performance in a given WMN. For a more comprehensive evaluation, we consider two more CA schemes in addition to BFS-CA and MaIS-CA. The \ufb01rst is a centralized heuristic scheme [25] which initially assigns a common channel to all nodes in the WMN. It then replaces the channels currently assigned to links so that the overall interference number of the network decreases that is the TID of the WMN decreases. We denote it by CEN-CA. The second CA scheme is a maximal clique based approach [20], where the authors assign channels to radios in such a way that a maximal clique of the wireless links can be formed. Maximal clique creation would ensure that the number of non-con\ufb02icting links in a WMN is high. The CA scheme is represented as CLQ-CA. Further, we generate C- MMCG and E-MMCG variants for both CEN-CA and CLQ-CA, which are denoted in the naming convention being followed that is CEN- CA1 and CLQ-CA1 are the C- MMCG CAs, while CEN-CA2 and CLQ-CA2 are their E- MMCG counterparts. Thus, we have a total of eight CA schemes and for each CA, we compute the TID and observe its performance in terms of ThroughputNet and PLR values. We subject the CA set to the test-cases of Test Case Class 3, as these are the test scenarios of peak network traf\ufb01c and thus ideal for assessing impact of interference on the recorded metrics. For each CA, we record the ThroughputNet and PLR values for the four test-cases viz, D2, H4V4, H5V5 and H5V5D2. The results for BFS-CA and MaIS-CA have already been presented in the previous section. We now present the ThroughputNet and PLR values registered for the new CAs in Figs. 13 and 14, respectively. Here too the E-MMCG CAs perform better than the cor- responding C-MMCG CAs, both in terms of ThroughputNet and PLR. The only exception is CLQ-CA2 registering a marginally higher PLR than CLQ-CA1 in test-cases D2 and H4V4. Nevertheless, the four E-MMCG CAs perform decidedly better than their C-MMCG counterparts and these results further consolidate the ef\ufb01cacy of E-MMCG in restraining the RCI.  Next we compute the average of the recorded ThroughputNet and PLR values of all the test-cases in Test Case Class 3, to determine the Average (Avg) Through- putNet and Average (Avg) PLR for each CA. Average values of the two metrics re\ufb02ect the overall performance of the CA in the grid WMN topology, which can be compared with the TID value of the corresponding CA. The TID values are computed using the E-MMCG algorithm. The computed values of Avg ThroughputNet and Avg PLR are plotted against the TID values in Figs. 16 and 17, respec- tively. The CA schemes are denoted as: BFS-CA1 (BFS1), BFS-CA2 (BFS2), MaIS-CA1 (MIS1), MaIS-CA1 (MIS2), CEN-CA1 (CEN1), CEN-CA2 (CEN2), CLQ-CA1 (CLQ1) and CLQ-CA2 (CLQ2).

      "text": "with increase in TID estimates the Avg ThroughputNet values must decrease while the Avg PLR values must rise. As depicted in Fig. 15, the highest Avg ThroughputNet value should correspond to the CA with the lowest TID estimate and thereafter the plot should exhibit a negative gradient that is a decrease in Avg ThroughputNet as the TID value increases. Likewise, the Avg PLR values should increase as the TID estimate increases that is the plot should have a positive gradient. However, Figs. 16 and 17 show marked deviations from the assumed trends. This is evident from the fact that CLQ-CA2 has the lowest TID estimate among the 8 CAs while it ranks 4th in terms of Avg ThroughputNet and has the 3rd highest Avg PLR . In con- trast, BFS-CA2 has the highest TID value and yet offers a higher Avg ThroughputNet and lower Avg PLR than 3 other CAs. We now present the variation in CA sequences when arranged in the increasing order of expected performance on the basis of theoretical TID estimates, and the increas- ing order of actual performance on the basis of observed metrics. The CA sequences are elucidated below.  \u2022 TID: BFS-CA2\\ CLQ-CA1\\ BFS-CA1\\ MaIS- CA2\\ CEN-CA2\\ CEN-CA1\\ MaIS-CA1\\ CLQ- CA2 \u2022 Avg Throughput Net: CEN-CA1\\ CLQ-CA1\\ BFS- CA1\\ BFS-CA2\\ CLQ-CA2\\ CEN-CA2\\ MaIS- CA1\\ MaIS-CA2 \u2022 Avg PLR: CEN-CA1\\ BFS-CA1\\ CLQ-CA2\\ CLQ-CA1\\ CEN-CA2\\ BFS-CA2\\ MaIS-CA1\\ MaIS-CA2  It is clear that the CA performance sequence based on TID estimates is not in conformity with the CA performance sequences determined through experimental data. This \ufb01nding will have profound implications on the numerous CA approaches proposed in research literature which assume a direct correlation between TID estimate and CA perfor- mance. The underlying idea in most of these interference- aware CA approaches is to minimize the local interference degree at a node, or minimize the TID while assigning channels to WMN radios [35, 36]. There is no doubt that the theoretical concept of Interference Degree holds great rel- evance in estimating the intensity of prevalent interference at a node, or in an entire WMN. But extending this concept to compute TID for a particular CA in a WMN, and  predicting the expected behavior or performance of the CA on the basis of its estimated TID value is not a practically accurate approach. However, the task of ascertaining the bene\ufb01t and relevance of predicating CA design on its TID estimate is beyond the scope of our current work.  8 Conclusions and inferences  We begin by drawing the most fundamental conclusion that RCI has an adverse effect on the performance of WMNs. The Enhanced MMCG model accounts for and adequately represents the RCI caused by spatially co-located radios. It is thus better equipped and algorithmically more tuned to alleviate the adverse impact of interference, than its con- ventional counterpart the Classical MMCG model. The ef\ufb01cacy of a CA scheme in successfully mitigating the RCI depends on the extent of its knowledge of the con\ufb02ict links that originate from RCI.

      "text": "generation techniques including the proposed C-MMCG approach, fail to account for and represent the RCI induced link con\ufb02icts in the MMCG model. The E-MMCG of a WMN remedies this problem by making the CA scheme aware of the prevalent RCI scenarios, thereby enabling it to assign channels to radios in a manner that restrains the RCI. We can safely conclude that the CA deployments under the E-MMCG model invariably perform better than their peers under the C-MMCG model, for all the network per- formance indices. This is true for all 4 CA schemes we have considered in our study. The improvement noticed in MaIS-CA and CEN-CA is substantial as compared to BFS- CA and CLQ-CA where a less pronounced improvement was observed. Therefore, though the E-MMCG model augments the performance metrics of a CA, the underlying CA strategy also plays a determining role in this enhancement. This inference is a positive feature of the E-MMCG model that it does not alter or modify the inherent behavior or algorithmic nature of a CA scheme. On the use of TID as a theoretical estimate of the prevalent interference in a WMN, we can infer that it is not an ideal metric, especially when used to predict the behavior of a deployed CA.  9 Future work  Having established the notion of RCI and experimentally validated it, we plan to further explore the concept to engineer radio co-location aware channel assignment schemes. We also intend to take up the task of determining a better theoretical metric for estimating the impact of interference in a WMN and predicting CA performance.
