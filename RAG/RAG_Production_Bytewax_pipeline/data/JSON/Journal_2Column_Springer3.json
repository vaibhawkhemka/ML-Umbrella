Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2024) 11:30   Graphical Abstract  Introduction The transition from a fossil fuel-based economy to a  bioeconomy, utilizing a biomass-biorefinery model, (is  vital\u00a0for sustainable development and a safer environment  (Popp et\u00a0al. 2021; Voogt et\u00a0al. 2023). In this context, lig- nocellulosic biomass (for example agricultural residues) can be  used for diverse applications such as renewable energy  generation (Valizadeh et\u00a0 al. 2022; Naqvi et\u00a0 al. 2023) or  the production of monosaccharides and others industrial  chemicals (Zheng et\u00a0al. 2022; Sekyere et\u00a0al. 2023). Mono- saccharides or single sugars (for example glucose, xylose arab- inose) are a group of renewable chemical compounds that  can be utilised as precursors for the industrial production  of biofuels (Heinonen and Sainio 2013),\u00a02,5-dimethylfuran  (Lim and Rashidi 2023) and petrochemicals such as\u00a0isob- utene (Van Leeuwen et\u00a0al. 2012). But the lignocellulosic  biomass naturally contains polysaccharides (mainly cel- lulose and hemicellulose), which need to be\u00a0cleaved\u00a0into  monosaccharides. Furthermore, the recalcitrant nature  of these polysaccharides and their structural integration  with lignin pose a significant challenge to the production  of monosaccharides (Hu et\u00a0al. 2023). Acid and enzymatic  hydrolyses of lignocellulosic biomass are commonly used  for the production of monosaccharides. Various acids,  such as sulphuric acid (predominantly\u00a0used), hydrochloric  acid, acetic acid, and phosphoric acid have been reported   for hydrolysis. The use of concentrated acids poses several  drawbacks. The high corrosiveness of the acidic medium  necessitates that the reactors be made with expensive  materials (such as acid-resistant alloys or ceramics). In  addition, large quantities of chemicals are required for  the neutralisation of the acid hydrolysate, generating salts  whose management increases the cost of the process  (Jung and Kim 2015). Using diluted acids at high tem- peratures (120\u2013260\u00a0\u2103) for short reaction times (less than  10\u00a0min) is an alternative that could alleviate those issues  and has been widely employed in the hydrolysis of poly- saccharides (Shahbazi and Zhang 2010; Heinonen and  Sainio 2013). Enzymatic hydrolysis, mainly using cellulase  enzyme,) for the selective conversion of cellulosic fraction  into monosaccharides has also been widely reported, but  it has the disadvantage of being a slower (48\u201384\u00a0h)\u00a0pro- cess compared to acid hydrolysis. This is due\u00a0to the struc- tural complexity of biomass and the limited access of the  cellulase enzyme\u00a0 to the cellulose (Arantes and Saddler  2010).\u00a0To resolve the aforementioned issues, the pretreat- ment of lignocellulosic biomass with dilute acid at high  temperature and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of  pretreated solids is reported to be a promising integrated  process for the production of monosaccharides (Solarte- Toro et\u00a0al. 2020; Saini et\u00a0al. 2022). The acid pretreatment  of biomass cleaves the hemicellulose chains to produce a",

Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2024) 11:30  \t  prehydrolysate with significant amounts of monosaccha- rides and a solid fraction with a more exposed cellulosic  fraction that can be hydrolysed by cellulases (Kabel et\u00a0al.  2007). Optimisation of the pretreatment conditions, spe- cifically temperature and reaction time, has been carried  out to maximise the yield of sugar. Appropriate pretreat- ment conditions are required because mild treatment  conditions limit the conversion of hemicellulose to mono- saccharides, preserving some hemicellulosic structures  that act as barriers to the action of cellulases, whereas  harsher conditions cause the transformation of hemicel- lulose sugars to degradation products such as furfural  and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (Montan\u00e9 et\u00a0 al. 2002). In  addition, pretreatment conditions may modify the struc- ture of lignin, which would subsequently affect the non- productive adsorption of cellulases onto pseudo-lignin  (Yuan et\u00a0 al. 2021). Some authors have pointed out that  pretreatment conditions leading to maximum hemicellu- lose sugar yields (via acid pretreatment) and glucose (via  enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated cellulose) are differ- ent. For instance, pretreating olive tree pruning with sul- phuric acid for 10\u00a0min resulted in the highest recovery of  hemicellulose sugars (83%) at 170\u00a0\u2103 with a catalyst con- centration of 1%, the maximum enzymatic digestibility  (76[dot]5%) at 210\u00a0\u2103-1[dot]4%, and the maximum total sugar yield  (75%) at 180\u00a0\u2103-1% (Cara et\u00a0al. 2008). The Response Sur- face Methodology (RSM) is a mathematical and statistical  approach utilised for modelling and analysing problems  wherein responses are influenced by multiple variables (or  factors). The primary goal of applying RSM is to identify  the values of the variables that lead to optimal responses  using a minimum number of experiments. RSM has  been applied to know the optimal conditions for obtain- ing monosaccharides from the acid hydrolysis of differ- ent lignocellulosic biomasses, such as olive stone (Saleh  et\u00a0al. 2014), olive tree biomass (Garc\u00eda Mart\u00edn et\u00a0al. 2013;  Yildirim et\u00a0al. 2022), acacia wood (Lee and Yu 2020), date  seeds (Hasan Ba Hamid and Ku Ismail 2020), coconut coir  (Gundupalli and Bhattacharyya 2019), etc The pretreat- ment conditions applied to lignocellulosic biomasses are  strongly affected by biomass\u00a0characteristics, so optimis- ing the processes for each biomass type is very important  (Shahbazi and Zhang 2010). Almond tree (Prunus dulcis (Mill) D.A. Webb) is  one of the woody crops whose production has experi- enced greater growth in recent decades worldwide. For  instance, in 2021 the harvested area and shelled almond  production were 2[dot]28\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 106\u00a0ha and 3[dot]99\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 106 tons, respec- tively. This represents an increase of 37% in the harvested  area and 175% in fruit production compared to 2000  (FAOSTAT 2023). These percentages could be explained  by the human health benefits of almonds and their  derived products (Johnston et\u00a0 al. 2017; Barreca et\u00a0 al.   2020). Globally, Spain holds first rank in terms of almond  tree harvested area (744,000 hectares) and is the second- largest producer of almonds, only behind the US (MAPA  2022). The pruning of almond tree branches is an annual  operation that is carried out to maintain the health and  productivity of the trees, generating significant amounts  of residual lignocellulosic biomass (Vel\u00e1zquez-Mart\u00ed  et\u00a0 al. 2011). However, research studies on the valorisa- tion of almond-tree pruning biomass are scarce. In an  earlier work of our research group (Cuevas et\u00a0al. 2014),  different pretreatments (liquid hot water, diluted sulphu- ric acid and delignification with hydrogen peroxide) were  combined with enzymatic hydrolysis for sugar produc- tion from almond tree prunings. This study concluded  that pretreatment with dilute sulphuric acid was the most  suitable, considering both the sugar yield and the sim- plicity of the process. Nevertheless, in this study, the con- ditions for acid pretreatment were not optimised using  response surface methodology, and the co-production of  solid biofuels and their characteristics were not included.  This analysis would be of great interest to valorise the  final lignin-rich solid by thermochemical routes such  as combustion, gasification or pyrolysis (Woytiuk et\u00a0 al.  2017; Liu et\u00a0 al. 2022; Ma et\u00a0 al. 2022). The main objec- tive of the present study was to investigate the potential  of almond prunings for sugar production through a two- stage sequential process (pretreatment with dilute sul- phuric acid and enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated  solids) optimising the pretreatment conditions. The acid  pretreatment was performed based on a response surface  methodology, for the determination of optimal condi- tions to maximise both sugar recovery in the prehydro- lysate and glucose production through the enzymatic  hydrolysis of pretreated cellulose. The ultimate goal was  to identify the pretreatment that maximises overall sugar  production. The influence of process conditions is also  being studied to co-produce a solid lignin-rich material  with improved energy characteristics (heating value, ash  content and moisture adsorption capacity). The present  research results and findings will contribute towards pro- moting the use of almond tree pruning biomass as a sub- strate in lignocellulosic biomass-based biorefinery.  Materials and\u00a0methods Raw material The almond prunings of Prunus dulcis (Mill) D.A.  Webb cv. \"Tuono\" was collected from a farm located in  Alhama de Granada (province of Granada, Spain, UTM  coordinates 37\u00b001\u02b946[dot]53\u2033N, 3\u00b056\u02b916[dot]64\u2033W). Pruning  biomass was air dried in the laboratory to reach an  equilibrium humidity of 7[dot]05\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]30%. Subsequently, the  biomass was crushed in a knife mill (Retsch GMBH,  Germany) and sieved to prepare two different particle",

Sizes smaller  than 0[dot]125\u00a0 mm were discarded because they contained  the highest proportion of inorganic matter during  sieving. The fraction 0[dot]125\u20130[dot]300\u00a0 mm was reserved for  the chemical characterisation of the original material,  which requires small particle diameters to ensure  complete chemical attack of the substrate. This same  particle size range (0[dot]125\u20130[dot]300\u00a0 mm) was employed  in a previous study for the characterisation of almond  prunings (Cuevas et\u00a0al. 2014). Dilute acid pretreatments  were applied to biomass with particle sizes in the range  of 0[dot]425\u20132\u00a0 mm, a size sufficiently small to ensure that  the solid diameter does not limit the attack suffered by  the material. In this regard, some authors indicated that  woody biomass fragments below 3\u00a0 mm usually exhibit  the same conversion when subjected to dilute acid  pretreatments (Vidal et\u00a0 al. 2011). The two batches of  biomass were homogenised to prepare representative  samples and stored in a dry place.  Pretreatment with\u00a0diluted sulphuric acid The pretreatment was carried out in a 2\u00a0\u00ad dm3 Parr Series  4522 reactor (Moline, IL, USA) equipped with an internal  protective vessel constructed of borosilicate glass.  The reactor was charged with 107[dot]5\u00a0 g of raw material  (equivalent to 100\u00a0g of dry solid) and 1000\u00a0\u00ad cm3 of dilute  (0[dot]025\u00a0M) sulphuric acid solution to work with a solid/ liquid ratio equal to 1/10. The suspension was stirred at 250\u00a0rpm and heated at  a rate of 4[dot]4\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]2\u00a0 \u2103/min until reaching an established  temperature (TR, \u00baC), followed by maintaining this tem- perature for a certain period or \u201creaction time\u201d (tR, min).  Finally, the cooling stage of the reactor was carried out  by circulating cold water through an internal coil. Experi- ments were conducted at varied temperatures (TR:  185[dot]9\u2013214[dot]1\u00a0 \u2103) and reaction times (tR: 0[dot]8\u20139[dot]2\u00a0 min).  These experimental conditions were chosen based on  previous results regarding the dilute acid hydrolysis of  almond tree prunings (Cuevas et\u00a0al. 2014), where reac- tion temperatures in the range of 180\u2013230\u00a0\u2103 with a con- stant reaction time (tR: 5\u00a0min) were employed). This study  established that the optimal TR values for the recovery of  hemicellulosic sugars in the prehydrolysate and for the  enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated cellulose were 190\u00a0\u2103  and 230\u00a0 \u2103, respectively, while a temperature of 200\u00a0 \u2103  was most suitable for achieving maximum sugar recovery  considering both pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis  stages together. The temperature profiles of four pretreat- ments experiments are shown in Fig.\u00a0 1. After cooling  to room temperature, the reactor was opened and its  contents were vacuum filtered to recover two fractions:  water-insoluble solids and liquor (or prehydrolysate).  The solid fraction was washed repeatedly with distilled   water until the prehydrolysate reached a final volume of  2\u00a0\u00ad dm3. This liquid was analysed for the determination of  simple sugars and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural contents. The  pretreated-washed solids (or washed insoluble solids,  WIS) were dried at room temperature (20\u00a0\u2103) and stored  for subsequent chemical composition analysis and enzy- matic hydrolysis experiments.

In the  response surface design for each factor, a low level (\u2013\u00a01)  and a high level (+\u20091) are defined. The center point is  coded to 0, while axial points (or star points) are located  at a given distance \u03b1\u2009=\u20091[dot]41 from the design center in each  direction on each axis to allow estimation of curvature.  The experimental data analysis was performed using  Modde 6[dot]0 statistical software (Umetric AB, Ume\u00e5,  Sweden). Equation\u00a01, obtained by regression analysis, was  followed to study each response.  where Y is the response value, TR and tR are the coded  values of the two independent variables, and \u00ad ai are the  intercept term \u00ad (a0), the linear effects \u00ad (a1 and \u00ad a2), the  squared effects \u00ad (a3 and \u00ad a4), and the interaction effect \u00ad (a5)  calculated from the experimental data.  Enzymatic hydrolysis The raw material and water-insoluble solids obtained  from acid pretreatments (WIS) were subjected to  enzymatic hydrolysis using a cellulolytic complex  (Celluclast 1[dot]5\u00a0L) which showed an activity of 33[dot]04\u00a0FPU/ cm3 (Ghose 1987). Enzyme loads tested were 10\u00a0FPU/g  solid and 15\u00a0FPU/g solid. For some experiments, a fungal  \u03b2-glucosidase (Novozyme 188) was used in order to  reduce inhibition by cellobiose. The load of \u03b2-glucosidase  was 30 International Units (IU) per gram of solid. To  perform the calculations, solid weights were determined  on a dry basis. Chloramphenicol was added at a final  concentration of 50\u00a0\u03bcg/cm3 to prevent microbial growth  and consumption of the released sugars. Enzymatic  hydrolyses were performed in 0[dot]05\u00a0 M sodium citrate  buffer (pH 4[dot]8) at 50\u00a0\u2103 on a rotary shaker (HT-Ecotron  benchtop incubator) at 150\u00a0rpm for 96\u00a0h and 10% (w/v)  solid substrate concentration (5\u00a0g/50\u00a0\u00ad cm3). Samples were  withdrawn from the reaction media at different times  (24, 48, 72, and 96\u00a0 h) to determine the concentration  of glucose and total reducing sugars (TRS). From these  values, enzyme digestibility (ED), glucose yield (YGlu/RM),  and total reducing sugars yield (YTRS/RM) were calculated  by applying Eqs.\u00a02\u20134.  (1) Y = a0 + (a1 \u00b7 TR) + (a2 \u00b7 tR) + (a3 \u00b7 TR \u00b7 TR) + (a4 \u00b7 tR \u00b7 tR) + (a5 \u00b7 TR \u00b7 tR)  (2) ED(%) = grams of glucose by enzymatic hydrolysis/100 g glucose in the substrate  (3) YGlu/RM = grams of glucose by enzymatic hydrolysis/100 g raw material  (4) YTRS/RM = grams of total reducing sugars by enzymatic hydrolysis/100 g raw material  The enzymes were procured from Novo Nordisk  Bioindustrial (Madrid, Spain), and all assays were  performed in duplicate.  Analytical methods The protocol described by Cuevas et\u00a0al. (2014) was fol- lowed for the raw material characterisation. In the case  of the pretreated solids (WIS), the TAPPI methods T12  os-75 and T15 os-58 were used to determine moisture   and ash contents, respectively, whereas the methodol- ogy described by Saleh et\u00a0al. (2014) was used to measure  the amount of cellulose, hemicellulose and acid insolu- ble lignin (AIL). To determine the concentration of  monosaccharides (glucose, xylose, arabinose, galactose,  and mannose) and 5-hydroxy-methyl-furfural in prehy- drolysates, liquors were diluted and filtered through a  0[dot]22\u00a0mm nylon membrane (Millipore). Thereafter, these  samples were injected into a Dionex ICS-3000 chroma- tography system (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA,  USA) equipped with a CarboPacTM PA20 (3\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u00a0mm)  analytical column, a CarboPacTM PA20 (3\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u00a0 mm)  guard column, and a pulsed amperometric detector. The  eluent was NaOH (2\u00a0mM), and elution took place at 30\u00a0\u2103  using a flow rate of 1\u00a0\u00ad cm3/min. Glucose and total reduc- ing sugar (TRS) concentrations from enzymatic hydroly- sis samples were measured by an enzymatic glucose assay  kit (Chemelex LABKIT Glucose-TR, Barcelona, Spain)  and the DNS method (Miller 1959), respectively. The  determination of the higher heating value (HHV) of sol- ids (raw material, pretreated solids, and solids resulting  from enzymatic hydrolysis) was carried out using a Parr  automatic isoperibol calorimeter (series 6400) accord- ing to ISO 18125:2017. The equilibrium moisture con- tents of solids were determined by a method previously  described (Aguado et\u00a0 al. 2020) using an oversaturated  solution of sodium chloride at 20\u00a0\u2103, which provides an  equilibrium relative humidity of 75[dot]5% in the surround- ing air (Greenspan 1977). All assays were performed in  duplicate.",

From 100\u00a0g of dry raw material, hydrolysis of the hemi- cellulosic fraction could theoretically generate 16[dot]6\u00a0g of  xylose, 2[dot]5\u00a0g of arabinose, 1[dot]4\u00a0g of galactose, and 1[dot]3\u00a0g of  mannose. The theoretical maximum amount of glucose  obtainable from 100\u00a0g of dry raw material would be 35[dot]4\u00a0g.  These data agree with a previous study on almond prun- ings (Cuevas et\u00a0al. 2014), which reported contents of cel- lulose, hemicelluloses and acid insoluble lignin of 31[dot]3%,  23[dot]0%, and 28[dot]7%, respectively. It is known that diluted  sulphuric acid, acting at high temperatures and for short  periods of time, can cause a significant modification in  the chemical composition of lignocellulosic biomasses.  Typically, the acid catalyst induces a strong hydrolysis of  hemicellulose and partial depolymerisation of cellulose.  This can be explained by the higher crystallinity of cel- lulose, which reduces the penetration of chemical agents  into its structure (Zhou et\u00a0al. 2021). Regarding the lignin  fraction, effective removal of this aromatic biopolymer is  difficult using a dilute acid pretreatment because, under  some operational conditions, the rate of depolymerisa- tion is slower than repolymerisation, leading even to an  elevation in the molecular weight of the lignin compared  to its native state (He et\u00a0al. 2022). In any case, the hydrol- ysis of polysaccharides will lead to a pronounced decrease  in the recovery of the solid fraction (quantified as \u201cTotal  Gravimetric Recovery\u201d , or TGR) after acid treatment.   When almond pruning was pretreated with 0[dot]025\u00a0M sul- phuric acid under the operating conditions specified in  Table\u00a01, the TGR values ranged from 54[dot]7% to 60[dot]1%, cor- responding to pretreatments P11 (214[dot]1\u00a0\u2103-5\u00a0min) and P2  (190\u00a0\u2103-2\u00a0min), respectively (Table\u00a02). The small variation  in the amount of solid recovered can be due to the appli- cation of a narrow temperature range (185[dot]9\u00a0\u2103\u2013214[dot]1\u00a0\u2103)  and short reaction times (0[dot]8\u00a0 min\u20139[dot]2\u00a0 min). Neverthe- less, it is observed that, in general, elevating the severity  of the pretreatment (higher temperatures and reaction  times) resulted in a discernible reduction in the TGR val- ues. Table\u00a02 also shows that all pretreatments produced  a strong reduction in hemicellulose content. Thus, the  pretreatment performed at 185[dot]9\u00a0 \u2103-5\u00a0 min (P1) gener- ated WIS with 3[dot]4% hemicellulose. This means that only  9[dot]4% of the original polymer was maintained, while in  the solids pretreated in the P5-P11 assays, the hemicel- lulose contents were less than 1[dot]5%. These values are  similar to those reported by Kabel et\u00a0 al. (2007) when  they achieved 8% residual xylans by hydrolysing wheat  straw with sulphuric acid (2[dot]5%) at 170\u00a0\u2103 for 15\u00a0min. The  strong loss of hemicellulose during pretreatment caused  the percentages of cellulose in the WIS (41[dot]0\u201347[dot]1%) to  be clearly higher than those of the raw material (31[dot]9%).  However, the acid attack also caused some loss of cel- lulose, whose conversion was increased under the most  severe pretreatment conditions. Thus, while P1 pretreat- ment (185[dot]9\u00a0 \u2103-5\u00a0 min) only eliminated 11[dot]3% cellulose,  P10 pretreatment (210[dot]0\u00a0\u2103-8[dot]0\u00a0min) resulted in a 28[dot]8%  biopolymer conversion (Table\u00a0 2). This same behaviour  was described in a previous work where the same type of  biomass was subjected to acid hydrolysis (Cuevas et\u00a0al.  2014).

It ranges from 38[dot]1\u201341[dot]1% in the WIS, with conversions  in the range of 13[dot]2\u201317[dot]2%. The acid pretreatment of hemicellulose and cellulose in  almond prunings produced a prehydrolysate with varied  amounts of simple sugars. Table\u00a0 3 shows the yields of  glucose, xylose, arabinose, and the sum of mannose plus  galactose for the eleven prehydrolysates. In addition, the  total monomeric sugar (TMS) yield, calculated as the  sum of the yields of the five monosaccharides analysed,  is incorporated. Xylose, glucose and arabinose were the  most abundant monosaccharides in prehydrolysates,  reaching yields of 4[dot]87\u201314[dot]50\u00a0 g, 1[dot]33\u20135[dot]23\u00a0 g, and 0[dot]89\u2013 2[dot]50\u00a0 g per 100\u00a0 g of dry raw material, respectively. The  yield of galactose and mannose was very low for all  operating conditions, and these compounds were not  detected in the P10 and P11 tests. The TMS yield ranged  from 7[dot]38\u00a0 g (P11) to 22[dot]50\u00a0 g (P6) per 100\u00a0 g of dry raw  material. For all monosaccharides, maximum yields  were obtained with intermediate severity pretreatments,  which led to a high generation of simple sugars (by  hydrolysis of polysaccharides) while controlling losses  of these monosaccharides by thermal degradation  (to  products  such  as  5-hydroxy-methyl-furfural).  Concerning the monosaccharide degradation products,  the P11 pretreatment, performed at the maximum  temperature tested (214[dot]1\u00a0\u2103), resulted in a relatively low  yield of 5-hydroxy-methyl-furfural (0[dot]45\u00a0g/100\u00a0g dry raw  material). Data from Tables\u00a01 and 2 was analysed in the Modde  6[dot]0 program to determine the effect of temperature (TR)  and reaction time (tR) during the acid pretreatment of  the almond pruning biomass. Mathematical models with  statistical validity were checked to obtain the following   responses: TGR for the pretreated solids; and xylose,  glucose, arabinose and total monomeric sugar yields  (Yxylose, Yglucose, Yarabinose and YTMS, respectively) for the  prehydrolysates. The model coefficients \u00ad (ai in Eq.\u00a0 1)  were obtained from the ANOVA analysis along with the  standard deviations for the different responses (Table\u00a04).  For all models, correlation coefficients (R2 and R2 adjust)  were acceptable. The value of R2 was 0[dot]934 in the most  unfavourable case (Yglucose), implying that only 6[dot]6% of  the total variations in the response were not explained by  the model. The parameters given in Table\u00a0 4 were used to repre- sent the response surface plots shown in Fig.\u00a02. For total  gravimetric recovery (Fig.\u00a02A), it was observed that both  the temperature and the reaction time exerted a nega- tive and linear effect on the response, with no quadratic  terms and no interaction terms between the two factors.  The same behaviour was earlier reported for the diluted  acid pretreatment of olive stones at high temperatures  (Saleh et\u00a0al. 2014).

Therefore,  the pretreatment allowed 90[dot]8% extraction of the xylose  present in almond tree wood. This value is in close range  to the data reported by different authors for the acid  treatment of different biomasses: 89[dot]7% for olive stone at  195\u00a0\u2103 for 5\u00a0min (Saleh et\u00a0al. 2014), 90[dot]95% for pinewood  at 106[dot]7\u00a0\u2103 for 4[dot]57\u00a0h (Cao et\u00a0al. 2018), and 94% for giant  reed at 141[dot]6\u00a0\u2103 for 36[dot]4\u00a0min (Shatalov and Pereira 2012).  The previous bibliographic references reveal how maxi- mum xylose extraction can be reached through an appro- priate combination of reaction times and temperatures.  Effect of\u00a0pretreatment conditions on\u00a0the\u00a0enzymatic  hydrolysis The application of the cellulolytic complex \"Cellu- clast 1[dot]5 L\" on pretreated almond prunings, employ- ing two biocatalyst loads (10\u00a0 FPU/g WIS or 15\u00a0 FPU/g  WIS), resulted in the production of both glucose and  total reducing sugars (TRS), with stable concentrations   achieved at 96\u00a0 h (Fig.\u00a0 3). It is important to note that  sugar concentrations depended heavily on pretreat- ment conditions but not so much on the biocatalyst  load used, possibly as a consequence of the small differ- ence between the two biocatalyst loads tested.Thus, for  the raw material the final concentrations of total reduc- ing sugars (TRS) were 7[dot]25\u2009\u00b1\u20091[dot]05\u00a0 g/L (10\u00a0 FPU/g WIS)  and 8[dot]52\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]37\u00a0g/L (15\u00a0FPU/g WIS) while with the solid  accomplished from P11 pretreatment the concentrations  were 17[dot]79\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]67\u00a0g/L (10\u00a0FPU/g WIS) and 18[dot]62\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]11\u00a0g/L  (15\u00a0 FPU/g WIS). The maximum glucose concentration  (10[dot]95\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]07\u00a0 g/L) was obtained using an enzyme load  of 15\u00a0FPU/g WIS and the solid from P10 pretreatment.

Earlier studies on the enzymatic hydrolysis of different  biomasses pretreated with diluted sulphuric acid have  also reported similar ED values: 47[dot]5% for almond prun- ings pretreated at 220\u00a0\u2103 for 5\u00a0min (Cuevas et\u00a0al. 2014)  and 43[dot]4% for coffee cut-stems pretreated at 120\u00a0 \u2103 for  180\u00a0min (Solarte-Toro et\u00a0al. 2020). The fact that acid pre- treatment does not allow for the complete hydrolysis of  pretreated cellulose may be due to various factors, such  as the high lignin content in WIS, the inhibition of the  catalyst by reaction products (cellobiose and glucose),  etc In relation to the presence of lignin, it is interest- ing to highlight that more severe pretreatments slightly  increased the AIL content in the pretreated biomasses  (Table\u00a02), simultaneously leading to an improvement in  enzymatic action. This could be explained by assuming  that acid attack facilitates cellulase access to the substrate  by increasing the solids porosity. However, at the same  time, non-productive adsorption between the residual  lignin and enzyme might occur, reducing the avail- able amount of biocatalyst. In this regard, some authors  reported that the solid resulting from the pretreatment  of bamboo with diluted sulphuric acid at 160\u00a0\u2103 for 1\u00a0h  exhibited an enzymatic digestibility of 29[dot]4%, a value  that increased to 64[dot]6% when adding the surfactant PEG  4000 to reduce cellulase-lignin bonds (Huang et\u00a0al. 2022).  In that study, enzyme loadings of 20\u00a0FPU/g glucan were  used, which are higher than those employed in the pre- sent work. The YGlu/RM values (Table\u00a0 5) were in the range of  3[dot]03\u201311[dot]68\u00a0 g glucose/100\u00a0 g raw material. The lowest   value was observed for the raw almond pruning  hydrolysed with an enzyme load of 10\u00a0 FPU/g WIS,  whereas the highest value was obtained when the  enzymes acted on biomass derived from pretreatment  P10 using a load of 15\u00a0 FPU/g WIS (Table\u00a0 5). In the  latter case, the value achieved is equivalent to a glucose  production of 29[dot]09\u00a0g per 100\u00a0g of WIS. These results  indicate that the conditions of acid pretreatment had a  strong impact on the enzymatic action. In addition, a  slight increase in YGlu/RM was observed as the enzyme  load increased from 10\u00a0FPU/g WIS to 15\u00a0FPU/g WIS.  On the other hand, Table\u00a04 also showed an important  difference between the yields of glucose and total  reducing sugars, even in experiments where the WIS  is virtually devoid of hemicelluloses. For example, after  pretreatment P11, enzymatic hydrolysis performed  with 15\u00a0FPU/g WIS led to values of YGlu/RM and YTRS/RM  of 11[dot]30\u00a0g and 19[dot]65\u00a0g/100\u00a0g raw material, respectively. The relationship between pretreatment conditions  (temperature and reaction time) and the enzymatic  digestibility of WIS could be described mathemati- cally by Eq.\u00a0 (1). A value of R2\u2009=\u20090[dot]988 was obtained  for 10\u00a0 FPU/g WIS with the following \u00ad ai values:  31[dot]182\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]436 \u00ad (a1), 8[dot]018\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]367 \u00ad (a2), 3[dot]466\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]367   \u00ad (a3) and 1[dot]138\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]418 \u00ad (a5). Whereas for 15\u00a0FPU/g WIS,  a R2\u2009=\u20090[dot]990 was achieved with 32[dot]844\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]266 \u00ad (a1),  7[dot]123\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]312 \u00ad (a2), 3[dot]797\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]312 \u00ad (a3) and 1[dot]675\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]442   \u00ad (a6). From the above values, response surface plots could  be represented (Fig.\u00a0 4). These figures showed that the  enzymatic digestibility of WIS is strongly affected by the  pretreatment with diluted acid, in such a way that the  maximum enzymatic digestibility is obtained using the  most severe pretreatments.

Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2024) 11:30  \t  hydrolyses performed with a load of 15\u00a0FPU/g WIS, the  maximum ED value (45[dot]4%) was reached after a pre- treatment carried out at 210\u00a0\u2103 for 8\u00a0min (Fig.\u00a04B).  Optimisation of\u00a0the\u00a0sugar production process and\u00a0mass  balance In order to study the impact of temperature and pre- treatment time on the overall production of fermentable  sugars, the sum of yields of glucose, xylose, arabinose,  galactose, and mannose obtained in acid pretreatments  (YTMS in Table\u00a0 3) was combined with the glucose yield  from enzymatic hydrolysis (YGlu/RM in Table\u00a0 5).This   resulted in a global monosaccharide yield from the over- all process, Yglobal), a parameter that ranged between  18[dot]68% and 31[dot]37%. By applying the Yglobal parameter as  response in Modde 6[dot]0, data in Table\u00a06 were generated.  This table contains the most relevant information about  the two mathematical models describing the depend- ence of the overall production of monosaccharides with  pretreatment conditions for enzymatic loads of 10\u00a0FPU/g  WIS and 15\u00a0 FPU/g WIS. Table\u00a0 6 revealed high R2 val- ues in both models, as well as the existence of quadratic  terms for factors TR and tR. Response surface plots representing the effect of TR  and tR on Yglobal\u00a0are shown in Fig.\u00a05. This helped in iden- tifying the maximum values of Yglobal obtained under the  studied pretreatment conditions. Thus, for enzymatic  hydrolyses with Celluclast 1[dot]5\u00a0L (loads equal to 10\u00a0FPU/g  WIS) the maximum Yglobal value (31[dot]37%) was accom- plished with pretreatment conditions of 197[dot]6\u00a0 \u2103 and  3[dot]8\u00a0 min, while for enzyme loads of 15\u00a0 FPU/g WIS, the  maximum value of Yglobal (31[dot]80%) was achieved with a  pretreatment at 197[dot]2\u00a0\u2103 and 4[dot]0\u00a0min. The pretreatment  conditions reached for the two enzyme load series were  very close. So, from a practical point of view, the temper- ature of 197\u00a0\u2103 and the time of 4[dot]0\u00a0min can be adopted as  appropriate values to maximise the production of sugars  from almond tree pruning. Cara et\u00a0al. (2008) achieved a  maximum Yglobal value of 36[dot]3% by pretreating olive prun- ings with diluted sulphuric acid (1%) and then subjecting  the WIS to enzymatic hydrolysis with a mixture of Cel- luclast 1[dot]5\u00a0L (15\u00a0FPU/g substrate) and Novozym 188 (15  International Unit/g substrate). The above value is slightly  higher than that achieved in the present study but implies  the use of a higher enzymatic load.

Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2024) 11:30   To study the effect of the incorporation of the enzyme  complex \u201cNovozym 188\u201d in the enzymatic production  of glucose, the raw material was pretreated under previ- ously optimised conditions (197\u00a0\u2103-4\u00a0min), and the WIS  was hydrolysed with Celluclast 1[dot]5\u00a0 L (15\u00a0 FPU/g WIS)  supplemented with Novozym 188 (30\u00a0 IU/g WIS). By  this method, an ED value of 52[dot]1% was reached, which  was equivalent to the production of 14[dot]77\u00a0 g of glucose  by enzymatic hydrolysis per 100\u00a0 g of raw material. The  addition of Novozym188 increased the \u03b2-glucosidase   activity which led to a Yglobal value of 36[dot]8%. This data is  equivalent to a recovery of 64[dot]3% of the sugars present in  the raw material. The above Yglobal values are in line with  earlier research findings related to high-temperature pre- treatments followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of various  biomasses: 37[dot]8% using rapeseed straw (Romero et\u00a0 al.  2018) and 37% using olive tree biomass (L\u00f3pez-Linares  et\u00a0al. 2013). Figure\u00a06 shows the material balance of the  sugar production process from almond tree pruning bio- mass including the pretreatment with diluted sulphuric  acid under optimal conditions (197\u00a0 \u2103-4\u00a0 min) and the  subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of WIS using Celluclast  1[dot]5\u00a0L (15\u00a0FPU/g WIS) and Novozym 188 (30\u00a0IU/g WIS).  The results obtained under optimal conditions also con- firmed the validity of the mathematical models used in  the present work (interval confidence of 95%).  Characteristics of\u00a0biomass and\u00a0solid fractions  for\u00a0thermochemical applications The diluted acid pretreatment of almond pruning bio- mass, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated  solids, produces both liquid and solid fractions. The liq- uid fractions are generally used for the recovery of mon- osaccharides. But it is also essential to valorise the final  solid from the sugar production process (a rich-lignin  solid residue) to achieve an integral use of the raw mate- rial. Thermochemical utilisation of biomass is generally  favoured by increasing higher heating value (HHV) and  reducing both the percentage of ash and the Equilibrium  Moisture Content (EMC). The EMC is indicative of the  capacity of adsorption of moisture by a solid under cer- tain environmental conditions and, in this work, it has  been expressed as mg of water adsorbed in each gram of  dry solid (mg/g). Figure\u00a07 shows the values of the afore- mentioned three parameters for the raw material, the  solids resulting from acid pretreatments (WIS) and the  solids resulting from the enzymatic hydrolysis of WIS  using an enzyme load of 15\u00a0FPU/g WIS. With respect to  the higher heating values (Fig.\u00a07A), the raw material had  an HHV of 18[dot]11\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]1\u00a0MJ/kg, a value clearly lower than  that of the solids generated in acid pretreatments (20[dot]48\u2013 22[dot]09\u00a0MJ/kg) and enzymatic hydrolyses (21[dot]28\u201323[dot]01\u00a0MJ/ kg,). In general, the application of pretreatments with  higher temperatures and reaction times led to an increase  in the HHV of the WIS. This way, solids derived from pre- treatments P1, P6, and P11 had HHV values of 20[dot]77\u00a0MJ/ kg, 21[dot]60\u00a0MJ/kg and 21[dot]99\u00a0MJ/kg, respectively (Fig.\u00a07A).  This could be due to the increase in the percentage of AIL  in pretreated solids (Table\u00a02), as lignin is the structural   Fig.\u202f5\u2002 Response surface plots representing the\u00a0effect of\u00a0temperature  and\u00a0pretreatment time on\u00a0the\u00a0global yield of\u00a0monomeric sugars  (Yglobal) from\u00a0almond prunings using two enzymatic loadings  of\u00a0cellulase: 10\u00a0FPU/g WIS (A) and\u00a015\u00a0FPU/g WIS (B)",

Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2024) 11:30  \t  component of biomass with the highest heating value  (Maksimuk et\u00a0 al. 2021). This fact would also explain  how, in general, the solids resulting from the enzymatic  hydrolysis showed slightly higher heating values than  WIS, as the enzymes reduced the amount of cellulose  available in the solids without altering the lignin fraction.  The maximum HHV reached in the experimental study  (5505\u00a0kcal/kg) was achieved with the solid that remained  after the pretreatment P11 (214[dot]1\u00a0 \u2103-5\u00a0 min) following  by the enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding WIS.  This HHV value represents an increase of 27% over the  heating value of the raw material, and it implies a higher  energy densification of almond wood than that reported  by Aguado et\u00a0al. (2020) when the same type of biomass  was subjected to wet torrefaction at 250\u00a0\u2103-10\u00a0min (23%  increase) and at 225\u00a0\u2103-60\u00a0min (26% increase), that is apply- ing much more energetically intensive treatments. On  the other hand, Fig.\u00a07B shows that the ash content of the  WIS (0[dot]14%\u20130[dot]75%) was clearly lower than the original  biomass (1[dot]28\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]04%). This could be beneficial for the  thermochemical use of the pretreated solids. The effect of  acid treatments on the ash content of lignocellulosic bio- masses has been studied by different authors (Lee et\u00a0al.  2021) and could be explained by considering that the \u00ad H+  ion reacts with the alkali components in the biomass via  neutralisation reactions (Chin et\u00a0 al. 2015). Enzymatic  hydrolysis generated solids with ash percentages slightly  higher than those of hydrolysed substrates (0[dot]35%\u2013 0[dot]86%). The reason could be that lignin contains more   inorganic material than cellulose. Regarding the moisture  adsorption capacity (Fig.\u00a07C) of the different biomasses  under a constant relative humidity atmosphere of 75[dot]5%,  the raw material showed an EMC value of 123[dot]9\u00a0 mg/g,  much higher than that of the WIS (81[dot]6\u201370[dot]1\u00a0mg/g) and  the solids from enzymatic hydrolysis (79[dot]8\u201369[dot]9\u00a0 mg/g).  These results could be due to the more hydrophobic  nature of lignin compared to cellulose or hemicellu- lose (Piao et\u00a0al. 2010). In the case of the process scheme  developed under optimised conditions for the produc- tion of sugars (Fig.\u00a06), it was found that the residual solid  generated after enzymatic hydrolysis had values of HHV,  ash percentage, and EMC of 5259\u2009\u00b1\u2009102\u00a0 kcal/kg (21[dot]4%  higher than raw material), 0[dot]87\u2009\u00b1\u20090[dot]04% (32[dot]0% lower than  raw material), and 72[dot]1\u2009\u00b1\u20094[dot]3 (41[dot]8% lower than raw mate- rial), respectively.  Conclusions Almond-tree pruning biomass is an agricultural waste  from which sugars can be obtained by applying the  process scheme tested in this work combined with a  response surface methodology. In this way, pretreat- ment conditions have been established to maximise  the extraction of hemicellulose sugars in the prehydro- lysate (195[dot]7\u00a0\u2103-3[dot]5\u00a0min), the enzymatic digestibility of  pretreated cellulose (210[dot]0\u00a0\u2103-8[dot]0\u00a0min), and the overall  sugar production (197[dot]0\u00a0\u2103-4[dot]0\u00a0min). Globally, 36[dot]8\u00a0kg  of monosaccharides were reached from 100\u00a0 kg of   Fig.\u202f6\u2002 Material balance flow of\u00a0the\u00a0\u00ad H2SO4 pretreatment of\u00a0almond-tree pruning biomass, under\u00a0optimal conditions, and\u00a0the\u00a0subsequent enzyme  hydrolysis of\u00a0pretreated solids",
