However, the uncertainties surrounding future  scenarios in debris-flow frequency and magnitude restrict its application. To estimate the economic risks caused by future  debris flows, a machine learning-based method was proposed to generate an economic risk map by multiplying a debris-flow  hazard map and an economic vulnerability map. We selected the Gyirong Zangbo Basin as the study area because frequent  severe debris flows impact the area every year. The debris-flow hazard map was developed through the multiplication of the  annual probability of spatial impact, temporal probability, and annual susceptibility. We employed a hybrid machine learning  model\u2014certainty factor-genetic algorithm-support vector classification\u2014to calculate susceptibilities. Simultaneously, a  Poisson model was applied for temporal probabilities, while the determination of annual probability of spatial impact relied  on statistical results. Additionally, four major elements at risk were selected for the generation of an economic loss map:  roads, vegetation-covered land, residential buildings, and farmland. The economic loss of elements at risk was calculated  based on physical vulnerabilities and their economic values. Therefore, we proposed a physical vulnerability matrix for  residential buildings, factoring in impact pressure on buildings and their horizontal distance and vertical distance to debris- flow channels. In this context, an ensemble model (XGBoost) was used to predict debris-flow volumes to calculate impact  pressures on buildings. The results show that residential buildings occupy 76[dot]7% of the total economic risk, while road- covered areas contribute approximately 6[dot]85%. Vegetation-covered land and farmland collectively represent 16[dot]45% of the  entire risk. These findings can provide a scientific support for the effective mitigation of future debris flows.

The socioeconomic  toll of such event is exacerbated by the rapid urbanization  and the impacts of climate change witnessed in recent years  (Hardwick Jones et\u00a0al. 2010; Stoffel et\u00a0al. 2014; Pei et\u00a0al.  2023). Therefore, in order to reduce casualties and losses,  adoption of hazard and susceptibility maps have been sug- gested by past studies (Mondal and Maiti 2013; Chen et\u00a0al.  2015; Angillieri 2020). However, these tools fall short in  indicating the potential distribution of damages (Remondo  et\u00a0al. 2005)\u2014a crucial aspect even in post-disaster recon- struction efforts. Conducting an economic risk assessment  becomes imperative to identify areas most susceptible to  debris flows and quantify the potential economic losses asso- ciated with such occurrences.

      "text": "150 \t Qiu et\u00a0al. Economic Risk Assessment of Future Debris Flows by Machine Learning  debris flows is part of the mitigation strategies aiming at  minimizing economic losses (Vranken et\u00a0al. 2015). Many methods have been proposed to assess the economic  risks caused by debris flows. For example, Dai et\u00a0al. (2002)  conducted a comprehensive overview of landslide risk  assessment, introducing an equation for evaluating property  damage that is applicable to debris flows. This equation  incorporates the annual probability of landslide (P(H)),  the probability of spatial impact (P(S|H)), the vulnerability  of properties (V(P|S)), and elements at risk (E). However,  the temporal probability was not taken into consideration  in the equation. This parameter signifies the likelihood of  experiencing at least one hazard event within a specific time  period (Guzzetti et\u00a0al. 2006). Furthermore, Liu et\u00a0al. (2009)  calculated the property loss resulting from debris flows  using numerical simulations to delineate the debris-flow  influence area. Nevertheless, this study failed to assess the  damage degree of buildings and infrastructure, potentially  yielding unreliable results. Moreover, a run-out model was  developed by Quan Luna et\u00a0al. (2014) to ascertain debris- flow intensities, which were used to determine the dangerous  zone. As a result, the economic risk can be calculated with  the consideration of the physical damages to the buildings.  However, the application of this established model is  constrained by the changes in debris-flow frequency and  magnitude. Therefore, there is a pressing need to derive a  more dependable method to estimate economic risks from  future debris flows. Our proposed model addresses the  limitations highlighted in prior studies by incorporating  temporal probability into risk assessment, evaluating the  damage degree of buildings, and considering the model\u2019s  applicability in future scenarios. To quantify the economic risks, a supervised machine  learning (ML)-based method was proposed. Machine  learning is designed to find the complex and hidden  relationships between input variables and output results  (Khosravi et\u00a0al. 2021). This is because a supervised model  is well suited in this study due to the lesser amount of  data and a clear labelled data for model training. Among  the several supervised models, support vector machine  (SVM) performs well in handling classification problem  due to its high prediction accuracy and good performance  in generalization. It has been proved that this model  outperformed the other supervised models due to the  highest accuracy when utilizing the UCI Repository of  Machine Learning Databases to conducting classification  analysis (Mohamed 2017). However, this method needs a  good kernel function, therefore requires the optimal hyper- parameters, C and gamma, for a specific classification  problem. Therefore, the genetic algorithm (GA) is  introduced to generate the optimal C and gamma so that  we can obtain a good kernel function for classification  problem and avoid overfitting (Burbidge and Buxton 2001).   Moreover, Mohamed (2017) also suggested that SVM has  a high sensitivity to input data. In this case, certainty factor  (CF) is employed to increase the stability of input data  so as to develop a robustness model. Therefore, a hybrid  machine learning model, certainty factor-genetic algorithm- support vector classification (CF-GA-SVC), was used in  our study (Qiu et\u00a0al. 2022). Additionally, an ensemble ML  model, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), was used  to predict the volume of future debris flows and estimate  economic losses, thus generating a reliable economic risk  map. XGBoost was developed based on Gradient Boosting  Decision Tree (GBDT) with the involvement of a L2 regular  term to avoid overfitting (Dong et\u00a0al. 2022). As a result, this  model has attracted a lot of attentions from various fields  due to its good performance in both computational speed  and prediction accuracy (Wang et\u00a0al. 2022). For example,  XGBoost performed better than logistic regression (LR) in  the medical field (Wang et\u00a0al. 2022). Additionally, XGBoost  outperformed artificial neural network (ANN) and SVM in  predicting groundwater levels (Osman et\u00a0al. 2021). A better  performance was found in utilizing XGBoost to predict  concrete strength when compared to SVM and multilayer  perceptron (MLP) (Nguyen et\u00a0al. 2021). Overall, XGBoost  is an effective machine learning model in conducting  regression analysis. Therefore, this model was selected in  our study to estimate the debris-flow volume of a future  event. The Gyirong Zangbo Basin in Tibet Autonomous Region,  China, was selected as the study area to implement the  proposed method. This area, characterized by an intricate  geological and geomorphological environment, experiences  frequent and severe debris flows annually.  2\u2002 \u0007 Methodology  Generally speaking, risk assessment includes hazard  assessment, vulnerability assessment, and definition of the  elements at risk. Therefore, a conceptual equation defined  by the International Association of Engineering Geology  (IAEG) and Varnes (1984) was proposed:  where R represents the risk. H is the hazard, and V represents  the vulnerability. E is the selected elements at risk. Dai  et\u00a0al. (2002) further developed Eq.\u00a01 for financial risk  estimation by considering the product of P(H)\u00d7P(S|H) as  the hazard, where P(H) is the annual probability of debris- flow occurrence, which indicates the probability of an event  occurring once a year, and P(S|H) represents the annual  probability of spatial impact. It is used to describe the  probability of an occurred event that reaches an individual   (1) R = H \u00d7 E \u00d7 V,",

However, this equation ignored the annual temporal  probability (P(Ht)), which means that there is generally at  least one event in a given period of time. Therfore, Vranken  et\u00a0al. (2015) reworked Eq.\u00a01 to estimate the risk of property  damage by utilizing P(H), P(S|H), and P(Ht) to represent  the hazard. However, the application of this equation under  future scenarios was not considered. Since vulnerability is  not a fixed value (Papathoma-K\u00f6hle et\u00a0al. 2017), we defined  a conceptual model to estimate the economic risk caused by  future debris flows at a regional scale as follow:  where P(Hs) represents the annual spatial probability of  a debris-flow event. P(Ht) is the temporal probability of  occurrence of one debris-flow event. P(S|Ht) represents  the annual probability of spatial impact, which means the  probability of a debris-flow event impacting the individual  property. The product of P(Hs), P(Ht), and P(S|Ht) represents  the hazard in Eq.\u00a01. Ve is the future economic vulnerability,  and E represents the elements at risk. Therefore, the  economic risk was estimated by using Eq.\u00a02. Before calculating the different components in Eq.\u00a02,  debris-flow volume prediction is the first step to be carried  out. Therefore, the selection of predisposing factors holds  significance in achieving reliable predictions, as these  factors can exert an impact on the ultimate prediction of  debris-flow volume. Huang et\u00a0al. (2020) highlighted strong  correlations between some geomorphic features and debris- flow volume, such as catchment area (A), channel length  (L), topographic relief (Rt), and mean slope of the main  channel (J). Apart from these four factors, the curvature of  the main channel (C) is also selected for volume prediction  based on Shi et\u00a0al. (2015). The values for A, L, J, and C  can be obtained through a digital elevation model (DEM)  with a resolution of 30 m.1 Rt is decided using the Focal  Statistics in GIS, requiring the determination of an optimal  statistical unit. However, a rectangle statistical unit was  employed in this study, and it contains n\u2009\u00d7\u2009n pixels (n\u2009=\u20091, 2,  3, \u2026). Therefore, in order to decide the optimal statistical  unit that can reflect the characteristic of the topographical  condition, we utilized the change-point model. This method  can decide the slope change point in the logarithmic curve  that depicts the relationship between topographic relief  and the neighborhood area. This change point is therefore  regarded as the optimal statistical unit. The basic steps are:  (1)\t The number of pixels of a statistical unit involved in  calculation is set in an ascending order ranging from  2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 to n\u2009\u00d7\u2009n;  (2) Risk = P(Hs ) \u00d7 P(Ht ) \u00d7 P(S|Ht ) \u00d7 Ve \u00d7 E  (2)\t Decide the average topographic relief (rj) and neighbor- hood area (sj) of each statistical unit using the Focal  Statistics tool; (3)\t Calculate the unit relief (Tj) of each statistical unit  through the ratio of rj and sj (j\u2009=\u20091, 2, 3,\u2026, n);  (4)\t Take the logarithm for Tj, ln (Tj), and construct a new  sequence X, X is {xj, j\u2009=\u20091, 2,3\u2026, n}. Then, calculate  the mean value, X\u200a , of the sequence X.  (5)\t Calculate the statistical values of S and Sj by using the  following equations to define the maximum difference  between S and Sj (j\u2009=\u20091, 2, 3, \u2026, 20). Separate the  sequence X to Xj1\u2009=\u2009(x1, x2, \u2026, xj\u22121) and Xj2\u2009=\u2009(xj, xj+1,  \u2026, xn).  where Xj1 is the mean value of the first part of Xj1, and  Xj2 is the average value of the rest part of Xj2. These  equations are used to calculate the expected values,  E(S\u2009\u2212\u2009Sj), j\u2009=\u20091, 2, 3, \u2026, n. The point that causes the  maximum difference between S and Si is called the  change point. Once the optimal statistical unit is deter- mined, the topographic relief for each catchment is cal- culated using GIS.  Following the identification of the optimal statistical  unit, we can calculate the topographic relief within each  catchment. Finally, for a catchment, the mean value of  topographic relief across different optimal units is employed  to represent its topographic relief. Subsequent to data preparation, an ensemble algorithm  (XGBoost) with robust and efficient computational abilities  is introduced to predict the volume of future debris-flow  events. The prediction performance is evaluated using  absolute bias (AB), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean  square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error  (MAPE), which are widely employed indices for assessing  model performance.

Economic Risk Assessment of Future Debris Flows by Machine Learning  where yi,pre is the predicted debris-flow volume, and yi,true  represents the measured debris-flow volume. m is the num- ber of prediction values.  2[dot]1\u2002 \u0007 Debris\u2011Flow Hazard Assessment  Debris-flow hazard assessment is fundamental for the  selection of possible safe areas to locate new residential  buildings and infrastructure. Hazard is calculated  considering the temporal probability (P(Ht)), the annual  probability of spatial impact to the properties (P(S|Ht)), and  annual spatial probability (P(Hs)).  2[dot]1.1\u2002 \u0007 Annual Spatial Probability (P(Hs)) and\u00a0Annual  Probability of\u00a0Spatial Impact (P(S|Ht))  A hybrid machine learning model (CF-GA-SVC) is  employed to calculate the annual spatial probability, taking  into account both annual precipitation and annual average  temperature. As for the annual probability of spatial impact  on a property, this parameter signifies the likelihood of  impact when flowing materials reach a specific property  (Corominas et\u00a0al. 2014). The annual probability of spatial  impact may vary across different catchments due to varying  occurrence frequencies for debris-flow magnitudes. For  buildings and roads, the debris-flow-related annual spatial  impact is derived from statistical results and interviews  during the field investigations conducted by Sichuan  Geological Exploration Institute from 2006 to 2018. In  the case of forests and pastures, we assume a probability  of damage equal to 1, implying complete destruction when  a debris flow occurs. Therefore, the annual probability of  spatial impact for forests and pastures is represented by  the reciprocal value of the recurrence period of a debris- flow event. While the recurrence period of a debris flow is  decided based on the statistical analysis of historical records.  2[dot]1.2\u2002 \u0007 Temporal Probability (P(Ht))  Temporal probability is associated with the occurrence  of debris-flow events of the same magnitude at least once   (8) MAE = 1  m  m \u2211  i=1  | | |yi,pre \u2212yi,true| | |  (9) RMSE =  \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a  m \u2211  i=1  (yi,pre \u2212yi,true  )2  /  m  (10) MAPE = 100%  m  m \u2211  i=1  | | | | |  yi,pre \u2212yi,true  yi,true  | | | | |  within a specified time period, also known as the exceedance  probability (Guzzetti et\u00a0al. 2006). To calculate the temporal  probability, the Poisson model proposed by Crovelli and Coe  (2008) is introduced:  where H(t) denotes the number of debris-flow events  within the time period t. \u03bc is the time interval between two  debris flows, and \u03bb is equal to 1/\u03bc. This formula illustrates  that if the time period t is long enough, there must be one  more debris-flow event observed in a catchment when the  parameter \u03bc is a constant. Concurrently, an increase in \u03bc  signifies a diminishing probability of debris-flow occurrence  within the specified time period t.  2[dot]2\u2002 \u0007 Future Economic Loss  Economic loss plays a crucial role in quantitative risk  assessment, serving as the link between debris-flow  occurrence and the elements at risk (Bednarik et\u00a0al. 2012).  To estimate potential economic loss (Ve) arising from future  debris-flow events, we employ the multiplication of the  economic values of elements at risk and their corresponding  physical vulnerabilities (Vp). For residential buildings, physical  vulnerability (Vp) is related to the impact pressure (Pt) induced  by the flowing material, and the horizontal (HD) and vertical  (VD) distance between the building and the nearest debris- flow channel. Pt serves as an effective indicator reflecting  the energy of the phenomena and the potential degree of  damage to buildings (Jakob et\u00a0al. 2012; Kang and Kim 2016).  In contrast, HD and VD reflect the impact intensity since the  actual damage is generally more significant if the building is  closer to the debris-flow channel (Sturm et\u00a0al. 2018). As a first step, we propose a physical vulnerability matrix  (Table\u00a01) to assess damages to buildings. Then, the impact  pressure on buildings is estimated based on the predicted  debris-flow volumes. Finally, the economic loss can be  appraised by multiplying physical vulnerability and unit price. The physical vulnerabilities (Vp) of roads, farmland, and  pastures are defined on the basis of fragility values as defined  in Totschnig and Fuchs (2013). In this context, fourth-grade  road is assigned a fragility value of 0[dot]85, while the third-grade  road has a value of 0[dot]65. Moreover, it is assumed that pastures  and farmland would suffer complete destruction in the event  of a debris-flow occurrence. The economic loss of an element caused by one debris-flow  event is defined as follow:  (11)  P[H(t) \u22651] = 1 \u2212P[H(t) = 0] = 1 \u2212exp (\u2212\ud706t) = 1 \u2212exp (\u2212t\u2215\ud707)  (12) Ve =  m \u2211  i  Vei",

This  area covers 2120 \u00ad km2, including two towns and 13 villages  (Fig.\u00a01a). The lithology class belongs to the Mesozoic era, in which  the Cretaceous \u00ad (K2zz and \u00ad K1j) mainly tended east-west (EW)  direction. Cretaceous formations, primarily comprised of  shale and sandstone interbedded with limestone, dominate  this area. Shale, known for its fragility and erodibility, con- tributes to the extensive availability of sediment for transport   (13) Vei = Vpi \u00d7 V\ufb01  (14) V\ufb01=  m \u2211  i  Pi \u00d7 Ai  on the slopes of the northern section of the Gyirong Zangbo  Basin. The widely distributed cracked rocks is a result of  the combined effects of intense weathering and active faults  (Qiu et\u00a0al. 2022), potentially leading to the mobilization of  sediment during heavy rainfall and the subsequent develop- ment of debris flows. In contrast, the southern part of the  Gyirong Zangbo Basin exhibits a markedly different mor- phology, characterized by widely distributed vegetation-cov- ered slopes. This geomorphic feature is attributed to warm  air from the Indian Ocean, fostering abundant rainfall and  creating an optimal environment for vegetation growth. In  this southern region, forests are primarily distributed at alti- tudes below 2900\u00a0m. Beyond the 4100\u00a0m threshold, where  glaciers are present, no forests are observed. In addition,  the southern part is characterized by schist, gneiss, granu- lite, and migmatite \u00ad (AnZN). Both schist and gneiss belong  to metamorphic rock, exhibiting a lamellar structure that  results in low shear strength along the dips, leading to unsta- ble slopes. Therefore, the expansive source areas and pre- vailing water conditions create an environment conducive to  the initiation of debris flows in this southern region.

The distribution characteristics of the selected  elements are shown in Fig.\u00a01b. In the study area, shrub, simi- lar to forests and pastures, is assigned a fragility value of  1[dot]0, implying complete destruction in the event of debris  flows. Therefore, shrub, forest, pasture, and farmland are  considered completely destroyed when debris flows occur.  Other land cover types, such as uncultivated land and gla- cier, are not incorporated into the economic risk assessment   due to challenges in estimating their economic values, as  they are unsuitable for farming and grazing. The widely dis- tributed crushed rocks in the northern part cannot serve as  the foundation of houses or infrastructure and therefore are  not considered in such calculation. River networks are also  excluded from risk assessment because there are no planned  hydropower plants or fishery industries. Generally, the roads in the Gyirong Zangbo Basin fall into  two main categories according to the Standard of Recon- struction Project for County-Level and Village-Level Roads  in China: county-level highways and backroads. This area  encompasses two towns and 13 villages, with most build- ings situated on alluvial fans or along streams. Alluvial  fans are commonly chosen for residential sites in mountain  environments due to their gentle slopes, smooth topography,  and proximity to rivers benefiting farming and living needs  (Schick et\u00a0al. 1999; Marcato et\u00a0al. 2012) but inevitably suf- fer a higher risk of debris flows. Livestock is the primary  income source for the local people and a large area of the  basin is pasture, which is mainly distributed in the northern  part (Fig.\u00a01b).

Prior to model training with the identified  factors, it is imperative to conduct correlation analysis to  ascertain their suitability for predicting debris-flow volume.  The relationships between each factor and debris-flow vol- ume were examined to ascertain their suitability using the  data in Table\u00a02. The analysis results revealed that the catch- ment area (A) factor exhibits the most robust linear relation- ship with volume since Person\u2019s coefficient is greater than  0[dot]8. The length of the main channel (L) follows, presenting  some correlation with volume, as well as the topographic  relief (Rt) and mean slope of the main channel (J), although  weaker. No correlation was observed between the mean  curvature of the main channel (C) and debris-flow volume.   Therefore, C was excluded, and only A, L, Rt, and J were  used to develop the debris flow volume prediction model. Following the correlation analysis, the data were split  into a training set and a testing set with a ratio of 7:3.  The training set was used to develop a prediction model  through tenfolds cross-validations and leave-one-out cross- validations, while the testing set served to evaluate the  performance of the prediction model. Following this, the  model\u2019s performance was further evaluated, demonstrat- ing a reduction in MAPE value to 9[dot]32%. Regarding MAE  and RMSE, these two metrics are 501[dot]4\u00a0\u00ad m3 and 594[dot]4\u00a0\u00ad m3,  respectively. The MB was calculated as \u2212\u200950[dot]6\u00a0\u00ad m3, indi- cating an underestimation of debris-flow volume but with  a relatively small average deviation from the measured  value. The prediction results are plotted against the meas- ured values in Fig.\u00a02a. This figure shows that the predic- tion results well agree with the measured values.

Economic Risk Assessment of Future Debris Flows by Machine Learning  illuminates the significance of each raw factor but also pro- vides valuable insights for utilizing the developed model  in estimating debris-flow volumes. To accomplish this,  we assessed the significance of each raw factor by sys- tematically excluding one factor at a time, thereby training  four models. They are Model 1 (A\u2009+\u2009L\u2009+\u2009Rt\u2009+\u2009J), Model 2  (A\u2009+\u2009L\u2009+\u2009Rt), Model 3 (A\u2009+\u2009L), and Model 4 (A). Subse- quently, we assessed the estimation accuracy of the four  models using the RMSE, MAE, AB, and MAPE indices,  and the corresponding results are depicted in Fig.\u00a02b\u2013d.  Model 1 stands out as the most effective model, whereas  the estimation outcomes of Model 4 demonstrate the most  significant deviation from the measured values. To conduct  a more comprehensive performance comparison among  the four models, we calculated the MAPE, RMSE, and  MAE values (Fig.\u00a02). Figure\u00a02b shows an 193[dot]5% increase of MAPE when  J was excluded from model training (Model 2), which  indicates a significant decrease of prediction accuracy.  Another accuracy decline of 15[dot]8% was noted when fac- tor Rt was omitted from the factor combination (Model  3). It can be concluded that J plays a more critical role  in enhancing estimations compared to Rt. Furthermore,   a significant reduction in prediction accuracy was found  when only A was used (Model 4) for debris-flow volume  estimation, reaching 188[dot]8% decline of prediction accu- racy when compared to Model 3. Although catchment size  may suggest the potential water storage and the maximum  capacity for erodible debris materials within a debris- flow catchment, the scaling relationship between catch- ment areas and debris-flow volume is intricate (Gartner  et\u00a0al. 2008; Marchi et\u00a0al. 2019; Lee et\u00a0al. 2021). This  complexity poses a challenge in relying on a single factor  for achieving a reliable estimation of debris-flow volume.  Figure\u00a02c illustrates the variations in RMSE and MAE  for the four models, showcasing an upward trend as the  number of input variables decreases. The RMSE values  for all four models consistently surpass the MAE values.  This discrepancy arises because RMSE amplifies estima- tion errors, particularly those that are relatively significant.  Consequently, the RMSE index is well-suited for detect- ing outliers, whereas MAE values typically represent the  exact errors between the estimation results and raw data.  Therefore, the increase in RMSE values signifies greater  estimation errors and instability in estimation performance  after excluding input variables (refer to Fig.\u00a02d).

      "text": "157 International Journal of Disaster Risk Science  As depicted in Fig.\u00a0 2d, Model 1 demonstrates the  most stable outputs, with estimation errors ranging from  0[dot]0055\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 104 to 0[dot]2031\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 104 \u00ad m3.

The calculation of susceptibility estimates  the occurrence probability of this event.  4[dot]3.1\u2002 \u0007 Annual Probability of\u00a0Spatial Impact to\u00a0Properties  and\u00a0Temporal Probability  The prediction results illustrate that the volumes of future  debris-flow events in this area are generally smaller than  20\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 104 \u00ad m3. According to the Specification of Geological  Investigation for Debris-Flow Stabilization (DZT0220- 2006),3 debris flows are categorized as medium-scale when  the volume ranges from 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 104 to 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 104 \u00ad m3, while small- scale debris flows have a volume smaller than 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 104 \u00ad m3.  The field investigations indicate that small-scale debris flows  occur approximately once every 2 years in this area, and the  return period of medium-scale debris flows is 5 years. For the temporal probability, a 5-year time period (t) was  selected. Within this timeframe, the time intervals (\u00b5) of  small-scale and medium-scale debris flows were determined  as 2 and 5 years, respectively. Therefore, the temporal prob- ability of 0[dot]91 was assigned for small-scale debris flows, and  0[dot]63 for the medium-scale debris flows based on Eq.\u00a011.

(2022). Figure\u00a03a displays a suscepti- bility map of the area with five levels, generated using the  CF-GA-SVC model. The occurrence probability of debris  flows ranges from 0[dot]0028 to 0[dot]9811. The high susceptibil- ity level is delineated within the range of 0[dot]7516 to 0[dot]9533,  while values between 0[dot]9533 and 0[dot]9811 indicate a very  high susceptibility level. Apart from the high and very high  susceptibility regions, the probabilities of very low and low  levels are 0[dot]0028\u20130[dot]0404 and 0[dot]0404\u20130[dot]2887, respectively.  The moderate level falls within the range of 0[dot]2887\u20130[dot]7516.  The results highlight that the very-high susceptibility level  is predominantly distributed in the southern part, attributed  to the glacier\u2019s location and abundant rainfall, both capable  of triggering debris flows. In recent years climate change  has promoted glacier degradation and thus generated more  exposed rocks and great availability of loose materials on  slopes. These materials can be mobilized by water runoff  or involved by mass movements, thus forming debris flows.  Additionally, glacier melting, influenced by rainfall and ris- ing temperatures, contributes to increased debris-flow occur- rences. This is because a 0[dot]5\u00a0\u00b0C increment of temperature  may cause a 6[dot]6% increase of annual streamflow based on  the study of Zhang et\u00a0al. (2011) when annual precipitation  is a fixed value. As a result, the mobilization of the accumu- lated and settled materials within the catchments may also  increase, which results in the increasing susceptibility. The  northern part of the study area exhibits a higher suscepti- bility to debris flows, primarily due to widely distributed  crushed rocks associated with tectonic activity. This sector  features one main fault and seven secondary faults, result- ing in large amounts of loose materials accumulating along  slopes or at their bases. These settled materials can start to  move under the effect of heavy rainfalls and glacial-melting  runoff, evolving into saturated/partly saturated flows. The hazard map resulting from the product of  susceptibility, annual probability of spatial impact, and  temporal probability shows values ranging from 0[dot]0013  to 0[dot]4415 (Fig.\u00a03b). These values are classified into five  levels\u2014very high (0[dot]3720\u20130[dot]4415), high (0[dot]1939\u20130[dot]3720),  moderate (0[dot]0605\u20130[dot]1939), low (0[dot]0182\u20130[dot]0605), and very  low (0[dot]0013\u20130[dot]0182)\u2014based on natural break point method.  The catchments with very high hazard levels are mostly  concentrated in the southern part.  4[dot]4\u2002 \u0007 Economic Loss Map  Using the predicted debris-flow volumes, the equations  proposed by Cui et\u00a0al. (2013) and Rickenmann (1999)  allow for the calculation of peak discharge and debris- flow velocity. The flow depth can also be defined based  on its velocity and the slope gradient of the main channel  (Koch 1998; Rickenmann 1999). Consequently, the catch- ments with building clusters were extracted to calculate  the impact pressure of future debris-flow events (Zan- chetta et\u00a0al. 2004) and to determine the damage degree  of the buildings affected by debris flows. The potential  impact pressures resulting from future debris flows are  depicted in Fig.\u00a04a. However, to assess the physical vul- nerability of the residential buildings, HD and VD need  to be defined. Building cluster polygons were extracted  based on satellite images (Gaofen-2). The used panchro- matic (black and white) images have a spatial resolution  of 0[dot]8 m. Furthermore, the Fishnet tool in GIS was used  to divide these building clusters into rectangles, each  representing a single building. Considering the average  house type, a 500 \u00ad m2 threshold was applied to generate  building rectangles (see building segments in Fig.\u00a04a).  Consequently, the physical vulnerability of each build- ing was determined based on HD and VD values, along  with the calculated potential impact pressure from a future  debris-flow event. Apart from the residential buildings, the  physical vulnerabilities of roads, farmland, and vegetation- covered land were decided based on the suggested fragil- ity values by Totschnig and Fuchs (2013). The economic  loss of each element was estimated based on the unit  price in Table\u00a03. The unit prices of buildings and roads  were decided based on the meeting with the Housing and  Urban\u2013Rural Construction Agency in Gyirong during the  field investigations. The unit price of vegetation-covered  land was obtained through the meeting with the Forestry  and Grassland Administration of Tibet, mainly including  the restoration cost after the destruction by debris flows.  \u201cProportion\u201d in Table\u00a03 illustrates the percentage of the  area occupied by each element in relation to the overall  study area. Based on the unit price of each element, we can estimate  the economic loss of each rectangle. Subsequently, the  economic loss of each building segment can be calculated  based on Eqs.\u00a011, 12. The economic losses of the catchments with build- ing segments are presented in Fig.\u00a04b. Since catchment  was used as an analysis unit rather than a grid unit, the  catchment unit can effectively reflect the hazard-inducing  environment. As depicted in Fig.\u00a04b, Zongga and Jilong  do not emerge as residential areas with the most severe  economic losses. This is primarily attributed to the major- ity of houses being constructed with reinforced concrete",

The distribution characteristics of risk levels  in Fig.\u00a05a align with the historical debris-flow distribution  in Fig.\u00a01a, as expected. Local inhabitants prefer settling on  alluvial fans to meet the demands of planting and farming,  as revealed by field investigations (Fig.\u00a05b, c). This choice  allows people to reside close to rivers, benefiting cattle  and sheep husbandry. However, the potential economic  risks stemming from future debris flows may lead to sub- stantial property losses, particularly in residential areas  with non-reinforced concrete frames. Therefore, it can be  concluded that socioeconomic development can promote  the accumulation of valuable elements, resulting in high  and very high economic risks due to future debris flows. Furthermore, we unveiled the contributions of the four  major elements to the total economic risk. As depicted in  Fig.\u00a02, pastures cover 56[dot]7% of the total area, with building  clusters representing the smallest percentage at 0[dot]5%.  However, pastures account for the smallest proportion of  the total economic risk at 2[dot]49%, while building clusters  are responsible for the largest share, constituting 76[dot]7% of  the entire economic risk. Forests contribute approximately  0[dot]72 \u20ac/km2, exceeding shrubs at 0[dot]33 \u20ac/km2. Roads, covering  almost 0[dot]2% of the total area, contribute about 4[dot]36% of the  total economic risk by third-grade roads, while fourth-grade  roads are responsible for 2[dot]49% of the total economic risk.  Farmland, covering an area of 20[dot]9\u00a0\u00ad km2, poses an economic  risk of 0[dot]75\u00a0\u20ac/km2. To validate the economic risk results, several catchments  identified during the field investigations conducted by  Sichuan Geological Exploration Institute are examined. As  shown in Fig.\u00a05a, a debris-flow event occurred in catchment  1, with a volume smaller than 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 104 \u00ad m3, classified as a  small-scale debris flow. Therefore, the annual probability   of spatial impact and temporal probability are 0[dot]55 and  0[dot]91, respectively, and the susceptibility of this catchment  is 0[dot]9423. The field investigation estimated an economic  loss of 3[dot]85\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 106\u00a0\u20ac. In this case, the calculated economic  risk is 0[dot]01\u00a0\u20ac/km2, aligning with the classified risk level  in Fig.\u00a05a. For catchment 2 in Fig.\u00a05a, a property loss of  3[dot]96\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 106\u00a0\u20ac was estimated during the field investigations.  The loss was caused by a small-scale debris flow (estimated  volume is 1[dot]7\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 104 \u00ad m3). The susceptibility of this catchment  is 0[dot]74. Therefore, the economic risk is 0[dot]04 \u20ac/km2, falling  within the range of 0[dot]03\u20130[dot]08. Moreover, a total of six debris  flows were observed on the same day in catchment 3, most  of which are hill-slope debris flows causing damages to  residential areas and roads. Therefore, these events are all  small-scale but claimed a total property loss of 10[dot]2\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00ad 106\u00a0\u20ac.  The susceptibility in this catchment is 0[dot]94. Consequently,  the economic risk is estimated at 0[dot]13 \u20ac/km2, placing it in  the moderate risk level (0[dot]08\u20130[dot]90 \u20ac/km2). These results can indicate the effectiveness and reliability  of the proposed method in estimating economic loss  risk related to future debris flows and therefore provide  guidance for decision makers about site selection of future  infrastructure and countermeasure construction.  6\u2002 \u0007 Discussion and\u00a0Limitations  The integration of a hybrid CF-GA-SVC model and an  ensemble XGBoost model serves to enhance the reliability  of the presented results. To be more specific, the hybrid  ML model (CF-GA-SVC) demonstrates an effective  improvement in the prediction accuracy of susceptibility  compared to traditional approaches (Vranken et\u00a0al. 2015;  Fu et\u00a0al. 2020) and the conventional ML models (Staley et\u00a0al.  2017). This is because the complexity of the debris-flow  event occurrence process poses a significant challenge for  susceptibility assessment using simple empirical methods.  Therefore, generating a reliable debris-flow hazard map  through such approaches may be unrealistic. In contrast,  the introduction of ML methods, with their robust ability to  handle complex spatial heterogeneity problems, facilitates  the establishment of more reliable and precise relationships  among numerous variables. Furthermore, the hybridization  of different individual ML models enhances the robustness  and accuracy of each single ML model (Ardabili et\u00a0al. 2020).  This hybrid ML method offers a scientific, advanced, and  systematic means to describe the triggering conditions of  debris flows. Additionally, a proper vulnerability evaluation is  fundamental for estimating economic risk. Past studies  repeatedly focused on physical vulnerability using  different approaches (Papathoma-K\u00f6hle et\u00a0al. 2017) but  further studies may be needed. If we can predict the",

To achieve this, we introduced  an ensemble ML model (XGBoost), which is composed of  a series of regressors to extract the relationship between  geomorphological conditions and possible debris-flow  volume. The subsequent step involves defining a factor  combination essential for analyzing impacts on residential  buildings, thereby supporting the formulation of the  economic risk map. We are aware that impact pressure,  along with HD and VD, cannot fully encompass the  complex effects of a debris flow on the buildings and  therefore we proposed this synthetic procedure that can  provide an average-based assessment of the damage  degree that can occur in a residential area based on the  construction typology. However, sample size may emerge  as an uncertainty to impact the performance of models in  estimating debris-flow volume. Therefore, we incorporated  32 more historical debris-flow events in Sichuan, China  into model training to test the reliability of the developed  model. The performance of this model with 81 debris- flow samples was further assessed, with MAPE reaching  9[dot]64%, which is slightly higher than the MAPE value when  49 samples were used for model development. This result  indicates that the predictions are accurate in relative terms,  which is a favorable aspect of its performance. The MAE  and RMSE are 560[dot]7\u00a0\u00ad m3 and 776[dot]3\u00a0\u00ad m3, respectively. The  MB is \u2212\u200990\u00a0\u00ad m3, which indicates an underestimation of the  debris-flow volume but relatively a small average deviation  from the measured value. Therefore, the incorporation of  more training samples may result in a slight decrease in  prediction accuracy without impacting significantly on the  prediction efficiency, which demonstrates the reliability of  the developed model based on 49 training samples. We are  also aware that 49 or even 81 samples are still not enough  if a wider application of this model is expected. This is  because the completion of this task needs continuous input  of debris-flow data in different areas and regions globally,  which may not be fully completed in this study. However,  the model developed in this study can support the effective  risk assessment in the Gyirong Zangbo Basin and even  the Himalayan regions due to the similar topographic and  meteorological conditions, and we will also keep working  on this model to increase its robustness so that we can use  the model to achieve reliable predictions at a national scale  or continental scale. Overall, the incorporation of the 32  more historical debris flows can increase the robustness  of the developed prediction model but cannot change  the prediction results to a large extent. The predicted  economic vulnerabilities and risks of the catchments show  slight changes without causing changes to the classified  vulnerability and risk levels. The economic analysis presented thus far serves to  map risk levels in various catchments, offering effective   guidance and scientific support for decision makers. By  quantifying potential risks, decision makers can gain a  better understanding of future challenges, enabling them to  prioritize actions and optimize resource allocation in high- risk zones. This approach facilitates long-term urban plan- ning, policy development, and the formulation of adapta- tion strategies to effectively reduce and manage identified  risks. Moreover, the preparedness and emergency response  system would be implemented accordingly. Despite these  strengths, some limitations persist, suggesting room for  improvement in the proposed methodology\u2019s performance.  The database of debris-flow occurrences needs further  enrichment to refine the volume prediction model. Another  potential area for enhancement lies in augmenting the  physical vulnerability assessment with new data, consid- ering additional building characteristics such as shape and  the number of windows. Nevertheless, all these limitations  cannot alter the fact that the proposed ML-based method  represents a new tool for generating a map of economic  risk caused by future debris-flow events. It also signifies a  practical method to deliver accurate and reliable warnings  to local residents about the risks posed by debris flows.  7\u2002 \u0007 Conclusion  In this study, a machine learning-based method was proposed  with the integration of a hybrid and ensemble machine  learning model to produce a map of economic risk due to  future debris-flow events. This map was derived through  the assessment of debris-flow hazards and the calculation  of economic losses associated with the elements at risk.  Completing the debris-flow assessment involves multiplying  the annual spatial probability of debris-flow occurrence, the  annual probability of spatial impact on properties, and the  temporal probability. During this process, we used a hybrid  machine learning model (in this case certainty factor- genetic algorithm-support vector classification) to calculate  debris flow susceptibility. This hybrid model integrated  topographical, ecological, geological, and meteorological  factors into model development. Apart from the debris-flow  assessment, the economic losses sustained by residential  buildings were analyzed, since this element comprises the  majority of the total economic risk. In this case, an ensemble  machine learning model, XGBoost, was employed to predict  the final volume of future debris-flow events because it  calculates impact pressure on residential buildings. To  provide reliable physical vulnerabilities for buildings at  risk, we analyzed the horizontal and vertical distance  values of buildings and proposed a physical vulnerability  matrix based on such analysis. Finally, the multiplication  of physical vulnerability and unit price of properties led",

To test the  efficiency and feasibility of this method in estimating the  economic risk, the Gyirong Basin in southwestern Tibet  was selected as the study site. The results revealed that  residential buildings account for 76[dot]7% of the total economic  risk, followed by farmland and forests. These calculated  results align with the actual distribution of debris flows  based on field investigations, demonstrating the method\u2019s  accuracy and applicability. Our findings suggest that this  method is suitable for the regional assessment of economic  risks caused by future debris flows in mountainous areas.  The proposed methodology can thus provide an effective  guidance and scientific support for decision makers in  the fields of risk understanding, resource prioritization,  definition of mitigation and adaptation strategies, long-term  planning, and emergency response, to prevent and mitigate  future debris-flow risk in the Gyirong Zangbo Basin.
