The cell culture conditions have been optimized for inducing expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers. Cells are cultured in the absence or presence of a bioac- tive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Single cells are isolated by Fluidigm C1 sys- tem. This is followed by cDNA library preparation using Takara SMART-Seq v4 Ultra and Illumina Nextera XT kit for RNA sequencing. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Siriwach et al (2022).1  BEFORE YOU BEGIN  First time cell cultivation and stock preparation  Timing: approximately 3 days  1. Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEKs, KURABO) are used at passages 1\u20132 and main- tained in an undifferentiated state in the HuMedia-KG2 media (KURABO). 2. The following protocol is based on the comprehensive instruction from KURABO. The manual (in Japanese) is available for download at: https://www[dot]kurabo[dot]co[dot]jp/bio/support/download[dot]php? M=PL&CID=6. 3. Frozen NHEKs are thawed and cultured in a T-25 \ufb02ask (bottom area 25 cm2). a. Warm up the HuMedia-KG2 medium containing 150 mM CaCl2 at 37\u0001C in a water bath approx- imately 10\u201315 min prior to seeding. b. Under aseptic conditions (on a clean bench), dispense 4 mL of the medium into a 15 mL centri- fuge tube and store it in a refrigerator. c. Add 4 mL of the culture medium to each T-25 \ufb02ask, slightly loosen the cap, place in a cell incu- bator (37\u0001C, 5% CO2, humidi\ufb01ed) and incubate for at least 30 min. d. Thaw frozen NHEKs. i. Immerse the bottom of the stock vial in the water bath and gently shake it from side to side. ii. When the frozen cells are almost thawed (about 2 min), remove the vial from the water bath, iii. Wipe the surface, disinfect areas around the vial with 70% ethanol and place it on a clean bench. iv. Carefully remove the cap and gently mix by pipetting.  STAR Protocols 3, 101906, December 16, 2022 \u00aa 2022 The Author(s).

      "text": "e. Count the cell number. i. Aliquot 20 mL of cell suspension from the vial. ii. Dilute with 20 mL of trypan blue for cell counting. f. Immediately add the remaining cell suspension (about 1 mL) from (e) to the centrifuge tube containing the medium described in (b) and keep in a refrigerator during cell counting. g. Count the number of viable cells (e) per 1 mL of cell suspension with a hemocytometer. h. Transfer the cell suspension (e) into prewarmed \ufb02asks (c). Recommended cell density is 2,500 cells/cm2, thus the total number of viable cells in (g) for one T-25 \ufb02ask should be around 62,500 cells.  Note: The following is an example of seeding calculation.  Total number of viable cells counted in (g): 500,000 cells. 4 mL of the dispensed medium (b) + 1 mL of the cell suspension (e) = 5 mL of total cell suspension. Number of viable cells required for one T-25 \ufb02ask: 2,500 3 25 cm2 = 62,500 cells. Concentration of cell suspension: 500,000 O 5 mL = 100,000 cells / mL. Required amount of cell suspension per \ufb02ask: 62,500 O 100,000 / mL = 0[dot]625 mL (625 mL). Number of T-25 \ufb02asks: 5 mL O 0[dot]625 mL = 8 \ufb02asks.  i. Tighten the cap and then gently shake the \ufb02ask to ensure even plating density. j. Place T-25 \ufb02asks containing seeded cells in the cell incubator, loosen the cap, and incubate for 24 h. k. After 24 h, observe the cells under a microscope.  Note: Cells should be attached and spread evenly on the \ufb02ask surface in the form of single individual cells or small clusters.  i. Aspirate the culture medium to remove the remaining DMSO (DMSO is included in the cryopreservation buffer). ii. Add new HuMedia-KG2 medium. l. After 72 h of seeding, observe the cells under a microscope.  Note: Numerous cell divisions should be observed, indicating that cells have been recovered to an active proliferative state. If cell attachment and division are observed, then cell thawing and seeding are successful.  m. Con\ufb01rm that cells reach con\ufb02uency of 70%\u201390% before proceed to the next step.  Note: The remaining cells can be kept as cryopreservation stock and use within passage 2.  Cell size measurement  Timing: 3 days (for step 4)  Cell size of NHEKs is measured to determine the optimum size of C1 Single-Cell for Auto Prep IFC (integrated \ufb02uid circuit) plate (Fluidigm).  4. Cell cultivation and compounds for stimulation are prepared in advance of cell size measurement. In our study, NHEKs were seeded on 24-well plate for LPA stimulation.

For our data, Harmony was used (v1[dot]0).7 More anal- ysis details are available in Siriwach et al.1  EXPECTED OUTCOMES  Based on this protocol, live single NHEK cells stimulated by LPA, can be isolated from the cell culture for subsequent scRNA-seq analysis. This protocol could also be implemented to isolate single NHEK cells from other compound stimulation. However, it should be noted that the cell size should be carefully determined to select the appropriate size of the IFC for single-cell isolation.  The transcription pro\ufb01les of each NHEK cell in the culture in vitro could be obtained using this protocol. In our study, we subjected 600 cells from each condition into the 96 wells IFC plate.1 The single cell isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed on the C1 system. The concentration of cDNA was adjusted to the range of 0[dot]10\u20130[dot]3 ng/mL and the libraries were then generated using 1 ng of cDNA using Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation. cDNA libraries were subsequently quanti\ufb01ed using a Bioanalyzer 2100. The size dis- tribution of our libraries were \u0003300\u20131,000 bp. The cDNA libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform at the read depth of 1 million reads per cell. After alignment and quality control, we ob- tained the transcription pro\ufb01les of 59 NHEK cells from the control group and 60 NHEK cells from the LPA-treatment group. Two-dimensional visualized with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of integrated scRNA-seq data (n=119) using Seurat revealed three different subpopulations of NHEK cell (Figure 9).6 We found that while most of NHEK cells from the control group belong to cluster 1,NHEKcellsfromthe LPA treatmentgrouplargely belongtocluster2 and 3. ThisresultsuggeststhatLPA facilitates the differentiation of a relatively homogenous NHEK population to two different cell populations.  Furthermore, the identity of NHEK cells in each cluster can be deduced by differential expression genes (DEGs) analysis. We found that cluster 1 cells expressed high level of basal keratinocyte markers, KRT5 and KRT14, and therefore annotated them as basal-like keratinocytes (Figure 10A). For cluster 2 cells, we found that they expressed high level of early granular keratinocyte markers such as TGM1 and SCEL, and therefore annotated them as granular-like keratinocytes (Figure 10B).

      "text": "Notably, the top DEG of cluster 3 cells was thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), a matricellular protein involved in tissue repair and cell migration (Figure 10C).  The above results suggest that this protocol can be implemented to evaluate the effect of other compound stimulations on the NHEK differentiation in vitro.  LIMITATIONS  First of all, it should be noted that although in vitro differentiation of the NHEK cells partially mimics in vivo differentiation of human keratinocytes, it is not physiological. Therefore, further validation of scRNA-seq analysis results with biological experiments are necessary. Regarding the Fluidigm C1 sys- tem, one limitation is the range of cell sizes. The cell sizes exceeding the size range of IFC will be \ufb01ltered out. The other limitation is that the Fluidigm C1 system can process only small number of cells compared to the droplet-based scRNA-seq system. Therefore, cluster analysis should be conducted and interpreted with caution. We used Fliudigm C1 system for this experiment, because at the begin- ning time of our experiment, the droplet-based scRNA-seq system was just getting established and not widely available. We speculate that droplet-based system might also be applicable to our experiment. However, it should be noted that Fludigm C1-based scRNA-seq is capable to read more genes than other scRNA-seq system. Therefore, it is also possible that the data obtained by other scRNA-seq sys- tem (example Droplet-based system) might be different. It should also be noted that one more important limitation of the Fluidigm C1 system is cells from different experimental condition could not be pro- cessed at the same time using the same C1 machine. For example, in our study, we processed the con- trol and LPA-stimulated NHEK cells on two different C1 machines in parallel. Therefore, researchers should also be careful about possible batch effect when running cells on more than one C1 machine. Finally, as a general limitation of scRNA-seq, the prevalence of genes with zero count are known. Due to this limitation, many low-expressed genes are rarely detected.  TROUBLESHOOTING  Problem 1 Response to LPA stimulation is weak. Please note that we used the expression level of the gene \u2018\u2018FLG\u2019\u2019 by qPCR to determine the LPA response.1,8 Given that FLG is a keratinocyte differentiation marker, high FLG expression re\ufb02ects strong response to LPA stimulation.

      "text": "Potential solution LPA is prone to oxidization and its biological activity can be easily lost. Therefore, LPA should be handled carefully. We suggest the use of freshly prepared LPA in every experiment. In addition, the condition of NHEK cells before seeding is critical. They should be kept in mitogenic and undif- ferentiation state. Furthermore, to obtain optimum results, lot check of NHEKs is recommended.  Problem 2 Bubbles in the IFC inlet when loading the reagents or cells after step 6.  Potential solution Allow the bubble to \ufb02oat to the top of well, then remove by pipetting or remove all reagents in the inlet and reloading.  Problem 3 C1 System error due to cell clogging.  Potential solution After generating single cell suspension, always con\ufb01rm the quality under the microscope. Never subject cell clumps into the C1 system. If clumps are observed, then \ufb01ltering with cell strainer might be helpful. Or alternatively, conduct FACS sorting. However, if there is no improvement, then modi- \ufb01cation of cell isolation protocol might be necessary.  Problem 4 At the quanti\ufb01cation of cDNA library step by Bioanalyzer, the shape of the chromatogram curves indicating the size distribution might be different between different samples.

      "text": "Potential solution The shapes of library size distribution might be varied. It depends on the biological nature of the sample. Therefore, the cDNA libraries obtained from NHEKs stimulated with different compounds may have different shapes. However, it will not affect the sequencing.  Problem 5 Batch effect between control and stimulated NHEKs.  Potential solution To avoid the technical batch effect, researchers should prepare the samples from 2 different condi- tions similarly and subject them to C1 system in parallel. For the data analysis, given that batch effect issue varies differently between experiments, we recommend trying different batch-effect correction computational methods such as Harmony7 or SCTransformed available in the Seurat integration9  and, choose the one that works the best for your data. In addition, we also recommend trying different parameter settings for each method. It should also be noted that overcorrection masks bio- logical signals and therefore, attention should be paid to avoid overcorrection.
